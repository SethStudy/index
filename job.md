- 赛斯资料中<b style="color:orange"><b style="color:orange">job</b></b>有以下几类含义：
  - 抽象的<b style="color:red">工作</b>，例如：有意识心智的<b style="color:red">工作</b>

## 在572节,赛斯用失去<b style="color:red">工作</b>的恐惧举例，阐述梦境的象征。

## 在个人实相11章,安德莉娅失去<b style="color:red">工作</b>，来访赛斯


## 在群体事件第三章，赛斯提及

>如果你想换<b style="color:red">工作</b>，你心怀那个欲望，一个新<b style="color:red">工作</b>就会以完全同样的方式进入你的经验，因为内在事件会由内我来安排。一件身体上的事件涉及许多肌肉关节的运作。换<b style="color:red">工作</b>的事件也关系到许多人的意愿，暗示了一个沟通网的存在，所有与事件相关的内我都涉入其中。那么显然地，一个具体的群体事件意味着一个内在沟通系统，这一系统的大小比例会把你们的科技沟通比下去。

>If you want to change your <b style="color:orange"><b style="color:orange">job</b></b>, and hold that desire, a new <b style="color:orange"><b style="color:orange">job</b></b> will come into your experience in precisely the same fashion, in that the inner events will be arranged by the inner ego. A body event involves the working of numerous muscles and joints and so forth. An event involving a <b style="color:orange"><b style="color:orange">job</b></b> change concerns motion on the part of many people, and implies a network of communication on the part of all of the inner egos involved. Obviously, then, a mass physical event implies an inner system of communications of proportions that would put your technological communications to shame.

## 在群体事件第七章，赛斯提及

>他举了许多为钱作恶的例子。这引发了一个活泼的讨论，但没有相反的意见能够进入这个人的内心。罗杰——让我们这么称呼他——的内心是一个理想主义者，但他相信，个人在这个世界里没有什么力量，因此，在他的个人生活中，他并不追求个人性的理想主义。“每个人都是体制的奴隶”，这就是他信念的方向。他在当地商界有一份<b style="color:red">工作</b>，一做就超过20年，却一直厌恶去上班，或说他确实厌恶，同时却拒绝尝试做其他领域的活动，而那些活动都是对他开放的，因为他害怕尝试。

>He cited many instances of nefarious acts committed for money’s sake. A lively discussion resulted, but no countering opinion could enter this man’s mind. Roger, let us call him, is an idealist at heart, but he believes that the individual has little power in the world, and so he did not pursue his personal idealism in the events of his own life. “Everyone is a slave to the system.” That is his line of belief . He took a routine <b style="color:orange">job</b> in a local business and stayed with it for over 20 years, all of the time hating to go to work, or saying that he did, and at the same time refusing to try other areas of activity that were open to him ---- because he was afraid to try.

>罗杰在任何社交团体里都以同样的方式说话，因而，他在某种程度上散播了一种负面与绝望的气氛。我并不打算只用这一方式定义他的存在，因为当他忘记在理想主义与实际生活之间的鸿沟，谈到其他活动时，又极富活力。不过，如果他基于他自然的兴趣选择其中之一来谋生，那种活力就可以给他更多的滋养。他可以是一位极好的老师。人家给他其他的让他更快乐的<b style="color:red">工作</b>，但他是这么相信自己缺乏力量，以至于不敢去利用那些机会。不过，在他生活里有一些满足，使得他不至于进一步窄化他的关注点。

>Roger speaks the same way in any social group, and therefore to that extent spreads a negative and despairing aura. I do not want to define his existence by those attitudes alone, however, for when he forgets the great gulf between his idealism and practical life, and speaks about other activities, then he is full of charming energy. That energy could have sustained him far more than it has, however, had he counted on his natural interests and chosen one of those for his life’s work. He could have been an excellent teacher. He had offers of other <b style="color:orange">job</b>s that would have pleased him more, but he is so convinced of his lack of power that he did not dare take advantage of the opportunities. There are satisfactions in his life [however] that prevent him from narrowing his focus even further.



## 在群体事件第九章，赛斯提及
>“试着让世界更好”的<b style="color:red">工作</b>仿佛是不可能的，因为看起来没有力量，而任何你个人能做的小小善行，与这个笼统的理想比起来仿佛是微不足道的，你轻蔑地把它们打发走，不去尝试建设性地用你的力量。

>The <b style="color:orange">job</b> of trying to make the world better seems impossible, for it appears that you have no power, and any small private beneficial actions that you can (underlined) take seem so puny in contrast to this generalized ideal that you dismiss them sardonically, and so you do not try to use your power constructively.

>你不从自己的生活、<b style="color:red">工作</b>或关系开始。(较大声)如果你干得不错，那么不管是做推销员、水电工，还是办公室文职或者汽车推销商，对世界的影响有什么分别呢？看在上帝的份上，一个人又能做什么呢？

>You do not begin with your own life, with your own <b style="color:orange">job</b>, or with your own associates. (Louder:) What difference can it make to the world if you are a better salesperson, or plumber, or office worker, or car salesman, for Christ’s sake? What can one person do?

>是的，那正是你必须首先开始努力的地方。在那儿，在你的<b style="color:red">工作</b>与人际关系中，才是你与这世界交会之处。在那些关系里，你的冲动直接影响着世界(热切地)。

>Yet that is precisely where first of all you must begin to exert yourselves. There, on your <b style="color:orange">job</b>s and in your associations, are the places where you intersect with the world. Your impulses directly affect the world in those relationships (intently).



## 在神奇之道第5节，赛斯提及
>In other words, the magical approach and the so-called rational one are to be combined in a certain fashion for best results. People sometimes write you, telling of their intent to make money — or rather, to have it. They concentrate upon money, so they say, and wait for it in full faith that it will be attracted to them because of their belief and concentration. They might do the point of power exercise,2 for example. They may also, however, have quit their <b style="color:orange">job</b>s, ignored impulses to find other work, or to take any rational approaches, and rely upon, say, the magical approach alone. This does not work either, of course.

>换言之，神奇之道和所谓的理性之道应该以某种方式合而为一，以产生最好的结果。有人有时写信给你，谈到他们想赚钱的意图——或不如说，想发财的意图，他们说，他们贯注于钱财上，并且以完全的信心等待它，相信由于他们的信心和贯注，金钱会被吸向他们。举例来说，他们可能会做「威力之点练习」（the point of power exercise）。不过，他们也可能辞了职，忽略想找其它<b style="color:re d"><b style="color:red">工作</b></b>的冲动，或采取理性之道，却单单地依赖神奇之道。当然，这也不会有效。


## 在未知的实相1 697节，赛斯提及

> In simple terms, you will not try to achieve something that you believe impossible within your concepts of reality. The conscious mind, with its normally considered intellect, is meant to assess the practicality of action within your world. You will literally see only what you want to see.2 If the race believed that space travel was impossible, you would not have it. That is one thing; but if an individual believes that it is literally impossible for him to travel from one end of the continent to another, or to change his <b style="color:orange">job</b>, or perform any act, then the act becomes practically impossible. The idealization of motion, however, in that person’s mind, or of change, may be denied expression at any given time — but it will nevertheless seek expression through experience. This applies in terms of the species as well as individuals. Because you are now a conscious species, in your terms, there are racial idealizations that you can accept or deny. Often at your particular stage of development as a race, these appear first in your world as fiction, art, or so-called pure theory.

>简而言之，你们不会试着去达成在你们对实相的观念内你相信不可能的事情，因为意识心以它正常被认为具有的智力是用来评估在你们世界内的行动之实际性。老实说，你们只会看见你想要看见的东西。一方面来说，如果人类相信太空旅行是不可能的，你们就不会有它。但另一方面，如果一个人相信他真的不可能由大陆的一端旅行到另一端、或改变他的<b style="color:red">工作</b>、或做任何一件事的话，那么，那件事就变得实际上不可能了。可是，在那人的心里，或改变之理想化也许可以在任何既定的时候不允许被表达——但它却无论如何会透过经验来追求它自己的表达。这适用于全人类，也适用于个人。以你们的说法，因为你们现在是一种有意识的族类，所以有一些你们可以接受或否定的种族之理想化。常常，在你们作为一个种族的特定发展阶段，这些首先会在你们的世界里以小说、绘画或所谓的纯理论出现。

## 在未知的实相2 734节，赛斯提及

>无论如何，因为他们很少是随俗者，所以他们常常是文化的地下组织之一部分。一个苏马利非常不喜欢作任何大型商业组织的一个成员，尤其是如果那<b style="color:red">工作</b>涉及了习惯性或令人厌倦的例行<b style="color:red">工作</b>的话。他们不喜欢在生产线上。他们喜欢玩味细节——或把它们用在创造性的目的上。他们为了那个理由，常常从一个<b style="color:red">工作</b>或职业换到另一个。

>Nevertheless, they are often part of the cultural underground simply because they are seldom conformers. A Sumari is very uncomfortable as a member of any large commercial venture, particularly if the work involves habitual or boring routine. They are not happy on assembly lines. They like to play with details ---- or to use them for creative purposes. They often go from one <b style="color:orange">job</b> or profession to another for that reason.


# 在早期课1中18节，赛斯提及

>[1]自信的内在自己，允许自我在物质世界中的操控，但不允许它变得过度激烈地保 护。
[2]你的作品在很多方面都包含了内在自己的力量。
[3]你的特定自我的功能，是向 你所知道的世界展示这个作品。
[4]我很犹豫，我是认真的，要不要给一个试图如此 实际的人，提供实际的建议。
[5]但是，我亲爱的约瑟，在一个你不能使用你的能力 的位置上<b style="color:red">工作</b>，扼杀你的能力是不切实际的。
[6]你不会因为你不能使用的能力而得到报酬，因为我知道你必须从经济方面考量。
[7]自我的<b style="color:red">工作</b>就是帮助你，用你真正 的能力换取你每日的面包。

>[1]"The confident inner self will let the ego manipulate in the physical world, but will not allow it to become fiercely overprotective.
[2]Your work contains the strength of your inner self in many ways.
[3]Your particular ego's function is to show this work to the world as you know it.
[4]I hesitate, and I mean this, to offer practical advice to one who tries to be so practical.
[5]But my dear Joseph, there is no true practicality in smothering your abilities by working in a position where you cannot use your abilities.
[6]You will not be paid for abilities you cannot use, since I know you must think in financial terms.
[7]Your ego's <b style="color:orange">job</b> is to help you trade your true abilities for your daily bread. "


>[1]一份让你无法使用这些能力的<b style="color:red">工作</b>，充其量是一种妥协，最坏的情况就是一种灵 魂受折磨的经历。
[2]目前你们俩的身体状态都维持得很好。
[3]如果你们担心社会地 位，恐怕我帮不上什么忙，但我要说的是。
[4]事情会变得更好，因为你允许自己扩 展。
[5]恐惧总是会紧缩。


>[1]A <b style="color:orange">job</b> which prevents you from using these abilities is at best a compromise and at worst a soul-stunting experience.
[2]At the present time you both are maintaining your physical status very well.
[3]If you are worried about social status, I am afraid I am not much help, but I will say this:
[4]Things will get better because you allowed yourself to expand.
[5]Fear always contracts.




# 在早期课2中76节，赛斯对罗的<b style="color:red">工作</b>建议如下
>[1]It is extremely difficult for Ruburt not to throw himself wholeheartedly and completely into whatever it is he is doing; and so it is no wonder that now and again he loses his fairly adequate detachment on a <b style="color:orange">job</b>.
[2]But then he feels himself engulfed.

>[1]对鲁柏来说，不全心全意地、完全地投入到他所从事的任何事中是极其困难的；因此，难怪他时不时地在<b style="color:red">工作</b>中失去了足够的超然性。
[2]然后他又觉得自己被吞噬了。

>[1]I am not as you should know, suggesting an eight-hour <b style="color:orange">job</b>.
[2]I am suggesting that you examine as objectively as possible your own basic expectations, for this will help you, and is a basic step in changing them for the better.

>[1]我指出这一点是为了你好。
[2]再次强调，我不是建议你急忙去找一份全职<b style="color:red">工作</b>，也不建议你把全部的精力都用在自由职业上。

# 在早期课5中238节，赛斯提及
>[1](Don Wilbur's parents are against his changing <b style="color:orange">job</b>s. The Wilburs did not ask Seth for advice, nor did Jane and I. Seth volunteered that it was better for Don to make his own decisions. He did say that Don would leave his present <b style="color:orange">job</b> because it offered no opportunities for advancement, and that he would try three other positions before he settled into one he really liked. But Seth did not say when. Don himself has not decided what to do. The place he visited that matched Seth's description has made him an offer of employment.

>1](唐·韦伯的父母反对他换<b style="color:red">工作</b>。韦伯夫妇也没有问赛斯的意见，珍和我也没有。赛斯主动地说，最好是由唐自己做决定。他的确说了唐会离开他现在的<b style="color:red">工作</b>，因为它已经无法提供他晋升的机会，而在他找到他真正喜欢的<b style="color:red">工作</b>稳定下来之前，他会试过其他三个<b style="color:red">工作</b>。但赛斯没有说何时，唐自己也还没有决定要怎么做。那个符合赛斯描述的、他所拜访的地方愿意雇佣他。

# 在早期课8中335节，赛斯提及

>[1]不用说也知道，全职<b style="color:red">工作</b>会改善财务状况，但我指的不是这种事情。如果——非常大的如果——如果你改变了预期，而创造出一种源源不绝的心灵气候，那么在改善经济状况的同时，基本上也可以保留跟目前一样让你乐在其中的<b style="color:red">工作</b>时间表。那些你想都没想过的门就会打开。

>[1]He felt particularly sensitive looking for a <b style="color:orange">job</b> precisely when his book had arrived in the bookstores. This seemed the one time when he should not have to look, you see.

# 在早期课8中344节，赛斯提及
>[1]—the very fact of seeking another solution will be of great benefit, in itself, and leaves open several possibilities. The <b style="color:orange">job</b> could be kept for a semester. It could be dropped entirely, or it could be kept while trying the experiment. The fact of trying the other experiment is really important in his present state of mind particularly. It offers him an alternative beside a regular outside <b style="color:orange">job</b>, to supplement the writing income.

>[1]——寻求另一种解决方案本身就具有很大的好处，会带来几种可能性。这份<b style="color:red">工作</b>可以做满一学期，也可以完全放弃，或是也可以在继续做的同时，尝试其他<b style="color:red">工作</b>。特别是在他目前的心理状态下，尝试其他<b style="color:red">工作</b>这件事真的非常重要，可以为他提供正常上班之外的另一种选择，以补充写作收入。
# 在早期课5中345节，赛斯提及
>这是鲁柏短暂经历到一种相当自然的结果，随着我们课程继续进行，我将会为你们提供越来越多的协助。当时，他感到幼儿园是真正向他开放的唯一选项，他担心自己在雅芳无法维持一份稳定的收入，而且对于公司要求的机动性吓到了。幼儿园似乎提供了一个折中方案，介于你对稳定<b style="color:red">工作</b>的想法和他自己对<b style="color:red">工作</b>的厌恶感。他对拒绝瑜伽课感到内疚，不过也觉得为了配合你的作为，他必须<b style="color:red">工作</b>五个下午。合约签完之后，他的症状又恶化了，而在拒绝夏天的职位时，又再度严重恶化。

>The nursery school was at the time the only move he felt really open to him. He was afraid he would not manage a steady income with the Avon, and already frightened of the mobility it demanded. Nursery school seemed to offer a compromise between your idea of a regular <b style="color:orange">job</b>, and his own dislike of one. He felt guilty at turning down the yoga classes, yet he felt that to match your performance he was expected to work five afternoons. His symptoms were aggravated again on the signing of the contract, and highly again when he refused the summer position.

>所有这些问题都影响了鲁柏对<b style="color:red">工作</b>的观念，如果高度重视这些问题，他的财富潜力将会大为增强。这不是害怕面对现实财务的问题，对他来说，有一种既有成效又有效率的方法可以做到，但是他一直太害怕，太惊慌而无法尝试。

>All of these issues bear on Ruburt's idea of a <b style="color:orange">job</b>. His money potential will be strengthened if these matters are highly considered. It is not a question of fearing to face reality financially. There is an effective and efficient way for him to do so, and he has been too frightened and panic-stricken to try it.

>他感觉要对自己和对你尊重，因此必须要有一份<b style="color:red">工作</b>，而且是稳定的<b style="color:red">工作</b>——由于上述原因，这件事产生了非常不愉快的后果，导致肢体活动受限的症状。这些症状进一步加剧他对依赖的恐惧，在他最糟糕的时刻，害怕自己会变成跛子，而你会离开他，那是他对母亲认同达到最高峰的时候——距离现在很久了。

>He felt his own respect and yours, he must take a <b style="color:orange">job</b>, and a regular one— and for the reasons given this had highly unpleasant repercussions that led to symptoms of immobility. These symptoms further aggravated his fears of dependence, and in his worse moments he feared that he would become a cripple and you would leave him. This was when the mother identification was at its peak—now long past.

>这时应该运用大量的深思和冥想，也该像找<b style="color:red">工作</b>那样投入那么多的能量，因为这里的各种潜能都强大得多。让鲁柏的决心应用在这里，会带来建设性的益处，这样做会解决一个长期存在的问题，要不然这个问题就一直会令人担忧。

>onsiderable thought and contemplation should be used here, and as much energy devoted as would be given in the search for a <b style="color:orange">job</b>, for the potentials are far greater. Let Ruburt's determination be applied here and it will meet with constructive benefits. It will solve a longstanding problem that otherwise will always be of some concern.

# 在早期课9中502节，赛斯提及
>假设你离开了<b style="color:red">工作</b>而根本找不到另一个，你会怎么做？你承担不起坐在家里。这种潜意识恐惧让你烦恼，正是在所有其他事情当中有了这个原因，你在你度假之前就已经有了症状。今年，你感觉假期几乎就像是一个威胁一样，因为在今年以来已经建立起来了这种恐惧。

>[1]Supposing you left your <b style="color:orange">job</b> and simply could not find another, what would you do? you could not bear to sit at home. This fear subconsciously nagged at you, and it has for this reason, among other, that the symptoms were with you before vacation. This year you felt the vacation almost as a threat because of the fears that had built up during the year.

>一天要几次告诉自己，你能够处理你遇到的无论什么问题。不要持续地思考<b style="color:red">工作</b>情况，以致于你一直用它持续地敲打自己的头。无论你什么时间发现自己，在以任何方式把失败投射于未来、甚至投射到明天，阻止你自己，提醒你自己你的想法正在形成真实情况。

>[1]Now. I have several opening remarks. Ruburt is more relieved than he realizes, because he realizes that the book meets with Aerofranzs (Tam Mossmans) approval; but more, because he knows he has done a good <b style="color:orange">job</b>. He was not sure until lately. You follow the reasons why.


# 第369次会话(已删除)
>Ruburt liked <b style="color:orange">job</b>s where he was outside and free. The spontaneous self enjoyed them. The overly conscientious self demanded that this was not work enough. It did not pay penance enough for the fact that you were working at Artistic. This, combined with your attitude that he take a normal <b style="color:orange">job</b>, almost literally paralyzed him, for your voice was added, in his mind you see, reinforcing the rigid attitude of the overly conscientious self. It deeply distrusted the spontaneity allowed in such <b style="color:orange">job</b>s.

>鲁伯特喜欢在外面自由地<b style="color:red">工作</b>。自发的自我喜欢它们。过于认真的自我要求这不足够<b style="color:red">工作</b>。这并不为在艺术上<b style="color:red">工作</b>而赎罪，加上你认为他要找一个正常<b style="color:red">工作</b>，几乎把他瘫痪了，因为你的声音也加入了他的头脑，强调了过于认真的自我的僵化态度。在这样的<b style="color:red">工作</b>中允许的自发性深深地不信任它。

# 第557次会议(已删除的部分)

>There was no great diversion. The unconscious was trying to give you what it thought you wanted, in that respect, now. If you wanted to leave your <b style="color:orange">job</b> badly enough and could not consciously decide to do so, then it would force the situation for you in the most obvious way possible

>没有太大的转折。在这方面，无意识试图为你提供它认为你想要的。如果你非常想离开你的<b style="color:red">工作</b>，但无法有意识地决定这样做，那么它会以最明显的方式强制你处境。

# 第562届会议(已删除)
>现在。几年前，你在艺术公司全职<b style="color:red">工作</b>时，对于Ruburt会意外怀孕的担忧变成了一种痴迷。你已经违反了自己的指令，在其他领域全职<b style="color:red">工作</b>，因此你变得更加害怕会陷入世俗的陷阱，生孩子，<b style="color:red">工作</b>因此变得不可或缺。
>Now. When you were working full time some years ago at Artistic your fears that Ruburt would become pregnant became an obsession. You were already breaking one of your directives, you see, in working full time at other pursuits, and so you became twice as frightened that you would fall into the world’s familiar mold, have children in which case the <b style="color:orange">job</b> would become indispensable.

# (删),你们是他们的灯塔1972年2月16日
>所有这些都导致身体运动的阻碍。不管出于什么原因，他从来不打算嫁给一个每天都出去<b style="color:red">工作</b>的男人，而是看到你俩一起投入<b style="color:red">工作</b>和爱情的共同友谊。你后来似乎很顽强地抓住了一份<b style="color:red">工作</b>不肯放手，他越来越害怕建议你这样做。
>[1]All of this contributed to the hampering of bodymotion. For whatever reasons, he never plannedto marry a man who would go away to work eachday, but saw you both involved in a jointlyshared comradeship of work and love. You, itseemed later, grabbed hold of a <b style="color:orange">job</b> with greattenacity and would not let it go, and he grewmore and more afraid of suggesting that you doso.


(删),创造性的自己说,1972年2月19日
[1]你们终于开始意识到我想让你们辞掉<b style="color:red">工作</b>(9:55,长时间停顿)，但已经建立起来的消极态度会依附于新计划上——这是我没有预料到的事情。我的能量就是你们俩的驱动力量。(停下来抽根烟。)我是你们的一部分，那么，那个总是怨恨你们有<b style="color:red">工作</b>的部分，并且几乎无法原谅你们把<b style="color:red">工作</b>保留的这么久。我知道这在一段时间内有必要，但所有超出日常必需品的安全理念对我来说意义不大。我希望你们足够安全，可以安心<b style="color:red">工作</b>。除此之外，我没有兴趣。


[1]You finally began to realize that I wanted youto leave the <b style="color:orange">job</b> (long pause at 9:55), but thenegative attitudes that had built up attachedthemselves to the new projects—something I didnot foresee. My power is the strength of both ofyour drives. (Pause for a cigarette.)I am apart of you, then, the part that always hatedyour <b style="color:orange">job</b>, and can scarce[ly] forgive you forkeeping it so long. I understand it wasnecessary for a time, but all thoughts ofsecurity beyond the daily necessities meanlittle to me. I want you secure enough to workin peace. Outside of that I have no interest.

#  (删),艺术灵感与时间无关

>他最初选择写作是因为它提供的自发性，但他的<b style="color:red">工作</b>理念与此直接冲突。作家可以随时闲逛。<b style="color:red">工作</b>的人必须继续<b style="color:red">工作</b>。一个作家可以在下午做爱。一个<b style="color:red">工作</b>的人必须抑制这种冲动。

>You believe you can make money. A simple declarative belief, but it is qualified. You believe you can make money-if you are a commercial artist, or if you take a <b style="color:orange">job</b>, or if you do almost anything else but your best work as an artist. You believe you are a good artist-a simple declarative belief. Between the two beliefs however there is some conflict, since you believe you also need money for your self-respect, but that you cannot get it by being an artist, which you feel is your focus of identity, and highly concerned with self-respect.


>你相信你能赚钱。一个简单的陈述性信念，但它是有条件的。你相信你能赚钱--如果你是一个商业艺术家，或者如果你接受一份<b style="color:red">工作</b>，或者如果你做几乎任何其他事情，但你作为一个艺术家的最佳<b style="color:red">工作</b>。你相信你是一个好的艺术家--一个简单的声明性的信念。然而，在这两个信念之间有一些冲突，因为你相信你也需要钱来获得你的自尊，但你不能通过做一个艺术家来获得它，你觉得这是你的身份焦点，并且高度关注自尊。


 >Give us a moment�. Some long time ago your own belief that good work could not be financially relied upon put up enough of a barrier so that Ruburt became frightened about his own work (a fact I have long suspected, and recently discussed with Jane), and set up a physical situation that would force him to stay home, literally, work, and prevent him from trying any longer those other avenues that you were still adopting. (<b style="color:orange">job</b>s, etc.)

 >给我们一个时刻....很久以前，你自己认为好的<b style="color:red">工作</b>在经济上是靠不住的，这就给你设置了足够的障碍，使鲁伯特对自己的<b style="color:red">工作</b>产生了恐惧(这是我早就怀疑的事实，最近还和简讨论过)，并设置了一个物理状况，迫使他留在家里，从字面上看，就是<b style="color:red">工作</b>，并阻止他再去尝试那些你还在采用的其他途径。(<b style="color:red">工作</b>等)

 >When you worked in an art department, even though you knew you were doing “commercial work,” society referred to you as an artist. You had a certain prestige. When Ruburt needed <b style="color:orange">job</b>s he worked in a factory, or he was a sales clerk or a door-to-door sales person-<b style="color:orange">job</b>s he felt that gave him no prestige. He was afraid, however, of such <b style="color:orange">job</b>s-prestigious ones-for fear the need for money would lead him to neglect his work. He became more economical.
 >当你在艺术部门<b style="color:red">工作</b>时，即使你知道你在做 "商业<b style="color:red">工作</b>"，社会还是把你称为艺术家。你有一定的威信。当鲁伯特需要<b style="color:red">工作</b>时，他在工厂里<b style="color:red">工作</b>，或者当销售员或上门推销的人--他觉得这些<b style="color:red">工作</b>没有给他带来威望。然而，他害怕这样的<b style="color:red">工作</b>--有名望的<b style="color:red">工作</b>--因为担心对钱的需求会导致他忽视自己的<b style="color:red">工作</b>。他变得更加节约了。

 >When you both had to work outside at least partially for a living, you did not have to consider your beliefs about creative time, or how to organize your day creatively. You were too busy trying to get rid of your <b style="color:orange">job</b>s. Once that goal was reached, your beliefs about time and creativity became pertinent, as did the issues concerned with spontaneity and discipline.

 >当你们都必须至少部分地在外面<b style="color:red">工作</b>谋生时，你们不必考虑你们对创作时间的信念，或如何创造性地组织你们的一天。你们太忙于摆脱<b style="color:red">工作</b>了。一旦达到这个目标，你对时间和创造力的信念就变得相关了，与自发性和纪律有关的问题也变得相关。

# (删),发愁是一种生物屏障(
 >[1]Though Ruburt was a good-looking young woman, with much vitality, he had no children, and indeed had been determined not to, for writing was the overwhelming interest in his life. He also needed love, however. Though you were in your thirties, you had not married, and your sex life was rather controlled. You both had at that point decided not to concentrate upon family life. You had furthermore decided, and separately, before you met, to avoid conventional long-term relationships in the world of business. Neither of you wanted conventional <b style="color:orange">job</b>s, regardless now of any prestige or security they might bring. In that regard you saw yourselves as like spirits. You believed in the importance of developing your own abilities, because those abilities so naturally manifested themselves as strong elements of your personalities.

 >鲁伯虽然是个精力充沛好看的年轻女子，但他没有孩子，而且确实下定决心不要，因为写作是他生命中压倒一切的兴趣。然而，他也需要爱。虽然你已经三十多岁了，但你还没有结婚，你的性生活相当受控制。那时你们俩都决定不专注于家庭生活。此外，在你们见面之前，你们还分别决定避免在商业世界中建立传统的长期关系。你们俩都不想要传统<b style="color:red">工作</b>，不管它们现在可能带来任何声望或安全感。在这方面，你们认为自己就像灵魂一样。你们相信发展你们自己的才能的重要性，因为这些才能自然而然表现为你人格的强大因素。


>I am describing attitudes. Years ago, when it looked—generally speaking, now: I am simplifying—as if you might be swallowed by Artistic, you rebelled and became ill. You made certain readjustments, the sessions began, time went on. You were not selling paintings to any considerable degree. Ruburt knew he would not take a full-time <b style="color:orange">job</b> either. You may sometimes forget now how vehement your joint ideas were in those years, against the ordinary individual’s prospect of working eight hours a day, year after year, in the same place, doing the same thing. So Ruburt added the necessity of money to his creative goals, in a strong fashion.
 >我描述的是态度。几年前，当它看起来——一般来说，我在现在简化——好像你可能会被艺术吞没，你反叛并生病了。你做了一些调整，课程开始了，时间在继续。你并没有在相当大的程度上出售画作。鲁伯知道他也不会从事全职<b style="color:red">工作</b>。你们现在有时可能会忘记，你们的共同理念在那些年里是多么激烈，与普通人年复一年，在同一个地方每天<b style="color:red">工作</b>八小时，做同样的事情的前景背道而驰。所以鲁伯以强烈的方式将金钱的必要性添加到他的创作目标中。

 # (删),创造性才能主要涉及框架二的导向


>在你们的社会里，<b style="color:red">工作</b>有很多内涵。完成一份<b style="color:red">工作</b>通常涉及花费一定的时间，并为此获得经济报酬。就时间而言，大多数<b style="color:red">工作</b>都涉及连续思考。如果你没有<b style="color:red">工作</b>，你们就是懒惰——所以<b style="color:red">工作</b>当然成为一种美德，通常也是一种必需品。

>In your society, work has many connotations. It usually involves spending a certain amount of time at a <b style="color:orange">job</b>, for which you receive financial payment. Most work involves consecutive thinking, in terms of time. If you do not have a <b style="color:orange">job</b> you are lazy—so that work becomes of course a virtue, as well as, usually, a necessity.

>鲁伯的创造具有高度个人主义，然而，范围并不狭窄。正如在一些旧课中所说，当鲁伯试图让他的创造适应传统<b style="color:red">工作</b>模式时，某些困难就开始了。有创造力的人往往在<b style="color:red">工作</b>中不受欢迎，因为他们的创造与其他人的行为相比，在我现在所说的快乐<b style="color:red">工作</b>与通常的多样性之间显示出的巨大差异。

>Ruburt’s creativity is highly individualistic—and not, however, narrow in scope. As given in some old sessions, certain difficulties began when Ruburt tried to make his creativity fit the conventional work patterns. The creative person often is not wanted at a <b style="color:orange">job</b>, because their creativity by contrast with others’ behavior shows the vast difference between what I will now call joyful work and the usual variety.

>你必须感觉自己可以自由辞职，并且相信其他职位可供你使用。你的感觉，是基于你不会找到另一个位置的恐惧。当你意识到其他职位对你开放时，如果你相信它们是，那么你可以自由选择。这是你缺乏运动背后的恐惧。你听懂了吗？

>you must have the feeling that you are free to quit the <b style="color:orange">job</b> and the faith that other positions will be available to you. Your feeling is based upon the fear that you will not find another position. When you realize that other positions are open to you, if you believe that they are, then you are free to choose. It is the fear that is behind your lack of movement. Do you follow me?

>You would do much better if your attitude followed thusly: I am in such a position that my seriousness has given me no benefits. My imagination has brought me fear. And I seem to be in a prison. All my hard work has brought me nowhere, and therefore I shall change my tactics and I shall play. I do not care, for I am playing, which game I try first. So today I shall call up and make an appointment immediately as a teacher and I shall pretend with all my might that I am an excellent teacher. And today I shall be a teacher as no teacher ever was! And I will think of all those students that I do not know yet and how I can help them and what fun it shall be! And so I shall call up and make this appointment. And it does not make any great difference whether I get this particular <b style="color:orange">job</b> or not—for if I do not get it, tomorrow I shall be an artist. And I shall call up and make an appointment as an artist—but I shall be free in whatever I do—and spontaneous.

>如果你如此遵循态度，你会做得更好：我处于这样一个位置，我的认真对我没有任何好处。我的想象力让我感到恐惧。而我似乎在监狱里。我所有的辛勤<b style="color:red">工作</b>都让我无处可去，因此我将改变我的态度，我会玩。我不在乎，因为我在玩，我先试试哪个游戏。所以今天我会立即打电话预约作为一名老师，我将竭尽所能地假装自己是一位优秀的老师。今天我将成为一名老师，因为出来不是老师！我会想到所有那些我还不知道的学生，以及我如何能够帮助他们，以及它将会是多么有趣！所以我打电话来做这个约会。我是否得到这份特别的<b style="color:red">工作</b>并没有太大的区别——因为如果我没有得到它，明天我将成为一名艺术家。我会作为一名艺术家打电话预约——但无论我做什么，我都会自由自在。

>It is according to your attitude. It depends upon whether you insist upon a <b style="color:orange">job</b> of prestige or a <b style="color:orange">job</b> that will give you enough money to pay your bills. You are insisting upon a <b style="color:orange">job</b> of prestige.

>这是根据你们的态度。这取决于你是否坚持从事有声望<b style="color:red">工作</b>或能够给你们足够的钱来支付账单的<b style="color:red">工作</b>。你坚持要有声望的<b style="color:red">工作</b>。

# esp2不要为没有遵守赛斯所说的话，而感觉到任何内疚

>Now, when I speak to you, I very seldom use words as love. I do not tell you that a god is waiting for you on the other side of a golden door. I do not reassure you by telling you that when you are dead, God will be waiting for you in all His majestic mercy and that will be the end of your responsibility. And so, as I said last evening, in your latest chapter, I offer no hope for the lazy, for they will not find eternal rest. However, through traveling within yourself, you will discover the unity of your consciousness with other consciousnesses. You will discover the multidimensional love and energy that gives consciousness to all things. This will not lead you to want to rest on the proverbial blessed bosom. It will instead inspire you to take a better hand in the <b style="color:orange">job</b> of creation, and that feeling of divine presence you will find indeed, and feel indeed, for you will Sense it behind the dance of the molecules and in yourself and in your neighbors.

>现在，当我和你们说话时，我很少用言语来表达爱意。我不告诉你们，有一尊神在金门的另一边等着你们。我不会告诉你们，当你们死后，上帝会以他所有的庄严怜悯等待你们，这将是你们责任的终结，我不会向你们保证。因此，正如我昨晚所说，在你们的最新一章中，我对懒惰的人没有希望，因为他们不会找到永恒的安息。然而，通过在你们自己的内在旅行，你们会发现你们的意识与其他意识的统一。你们会发现赋予万物意识的多维爱和能量。这不会导致你们想安息在众所周知的幸福怀抱上。相反，它会激励你们更好地参与创造的<b style="color:red">工作</b>，你们会发现并确实感受到那种神圣存在的感觉，因为你们会在分子的舞蹈背后，在你们自己和你们的邻居身上感知到它。


# ESP,在逃离宇宙时发生,
>Now, I will tell you something else that you will not necessarily want to hear, but you must also learn to relate to outside physical reality. You need physical work to do. This will improve your painting, your creative life, and your psychic life, but you are turning inward too much without knowing what you are doing, at this time. You need to compensate by direct and aggressive physical action , either in a <b style="color:orange">job</b> that will relate you with others or in some aspect along those lines that will allow you to untangle the inner self and release your creative abilities.

>现在，我会告诉你一些你不一定想听的东西，但你也必须学会与外在的肉体实相联系起来。你需要做体力劳动。这将改善你们的画面，改善你的创作生活和你的灵性生活，但你当前，在不知道正在做什么的情况下，已经太多地转向了内在。你需要通过直接并有进取的肉体行为进行补偿，无论是在你与其他人的<b style="color:red">工作</b>中，还是在可以释放你的内在自己，并释放你的创造才能的某些方面
