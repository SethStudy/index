<tr><td>SESSION 43</td><td>第43节第八内在感官,空间</td></tr><tr><td>APRIL 13, 1964 9 PM MONDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964年4月13日星期一晚上9点按指示</td></tr><tr><td>(While Jane was reading over the 42nd session this morning after breakfast, the word disentanglement came to her mind.This, she believes, is the eighth inner sense, making possible transportation and levitation; Seth has briefly referred to these two being dependent upon another inner sense.</td><td>(当珍在早餐后读完第42节课时，摆脱纠结disentanglement这个词浮现在她的脑海，她认为这是第八种内在感官，使传输和悬浮成为可能；赛斯简要地提到这两种内在感官依赖于另一种内在感官。</td></tr><tr><td>(While napping at about 4:00 PM, for a very brief moment Jane experienced the feeling she has described as infinite blackness, or enlargement.See page 309 [in Volume One of The Early Sessions] It came while she was still awake; she had just relaxed and her eyes were closed.This evening Willy behaved admirably, sleeping through the whole session.It was a warm and windy spring night, very beautiful, and during the session one of the living room windows was open.</td><td>(在下午4点左右打盹的时候，有一个非常短暂的时刻，珍经历了她所描述过的无限的黑暗，或者说是放大的感觉。当时她尚未睡着，只是闭上眼睛放松身体。这天晚上，威利表现得非常好，整节课一直都在睡觉。这是一个温暖多风非常美丽的春夜，上课时，客厅的一扇窗户是开着的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane dictated in a voice just a bit stronger than normal; she paced at an average rate, her eyes darkened as usual.She began talking a little faster than she had the two previous sessions.She was nervous as usual before the session began.)</td><td>(珍传述的声音比平时有力些；踱步节奏均匀，眼睛漆黑如常。比前两节课的说话速度稍快。她像往常一样，在课开始前有些紧张。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>This can be for the record or you may delete it.</td><td>这段可以当成记录，也可以删掉。</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes?")</td><td>("是吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>I told Ruburt that he wasn’t pregnant, so now I expect that our sessions will be a little smoother again now that he is relieved of the big question.I must say that his discipline was admirable, and that I myself gave him much aid.The sessions themselves have helped Ruburt develop discipline.</td><td>我告诉过鲁柏，他没有怀孕，所以我期望我们的课程将再次顺畅一些，因为他已经解除了这个重大问题的困扰。我必须说，他的自律令人钦佩，而我本人也给了他很多帮助。课程本身也帮助了鲁柏培养她的自律。</td></tr><tr><td>I am pleased that our practical exercises outside of class so to speak, are coming along so well.For one thing our Ruburt is a Doubting Thomas from way back, and evidence of the inner senses that are experienced outside of our sessions help along these lines.I do not want gullible ninnies, however I certainly would enjoy being taken at my word occasionally.Though the shock might be too much for even my constitution.</td><td>我很高兴你们的课外练习，可以说进展的非常好。一方面，我们的鲁柏一直以来就是一个怀疑主义者)(DoubtingThomas*)，另外，在我们课程之外所经历的内在感官证据，也会在这方面有所帮助。我不想要容易受骗的傻子，但是我说的话偶尔被人听进去，我当然会很高兴。然而以我的组成结构，可能也招架不住这种震撼。</td></tr><tr><td>I hope, Joseph, that you will also experience more of the inner senses.You certainly should.</td><td>我希望，约瑟，你也去体验更多的内在感官。你真的应该。</td></tr><tr><td>("How about my dream of the tree branch falling?Any connection there with the inner senses?")</td><td>("我梦见树枝掉下来的梦境是怎么回事？与内在感官有没有任何关联？")。</td></tr><tr><td>The dream of the tree?I do not know if it was merely a dream or not at this point.It was not the same sort of experience as the other you had in connection with a tree.I simply do not know if that particular limb will fall within a specific time.You may have seen its ultimate falling, but this was not the same kind of experience as Ruburt’s seeing the clock.</td><td>那棵树的梦？此刻我不知道它是否仅仅是一个梦还是不是。它和你另一个与树有关的经历不一样。我只是不知道那个特定的树枝是否会在特定的时间内掉下来。你也许看到它最终掉落下来了，但这和鲁柏看到钟表的经验是不一样的。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt was right.We shall call the eighth inner sense the sense of disentanglement; and it is one of the most basic inner senses.Complete disentanglement comes rarely on your plane, although it is possible to achieve it with training.Variations occur but usually some remnant of camouflage data is retained.</td><td>鲁柏是正确的。我们可以把第八种内在感官叫做脱离纠结(disentanglement)的内在感官；它是最基本的内在感官之一。完全脱离伪装在你们的层面很少发生，但通过训练是可能实现的。变化会发生，但通常一些残存的伪装资料仍会被保留下来。</td></tr><tr><td>Even here there are gradations.Consider again Ruburt in one room with his eyes closed, "seeing" the time by a clock in the other room.This clairvoyance is of the easier variety, and yet represents an important step in his development, and should in your own.He was concerned with a camouflage idea, that of time, and clock time at that, the clock itself being a camouflage.Clairvoyantly he merely disentangled himself enough to ignore some camouflage in order to perceive camouflage that lay behind it, and this is a necessary first step.</td><td>即使在这里，也是有渐进梯次的(gradations)。再次想想，鲁柏在一个房间里闭着眼睛，"看见"在另一个房间的钟表上的时间。这种遥视是比较简单的一种，但却代表了他发展中的重要一步，你自己的发展也应该如此。他关注的是一个伪装的概念，是关于时间的概念，而且是钟表的时间，钟表本身是一种伪装。透过遥视，他只是自己脱离纠结(disentangled)到足以)忽视某些伪装，以便感知它背后的伪装，这是必要的第一步。</td></tr><tr><td>Even for example, levitation is involved with camouflage to a large degree, in that the camouflage physical body itself rises, but we are still here using the camouflage physical form.Traveling without the camouflage physical form is a giant step, of course, but a possible one according to your development.Here you are traveling however through camouflage space.It is very difficult on your level to do without any camouflage, and yet it can be done; and here again the use of psychological time is extremely important, since when psychological time is utilized to its fullest extent, then camouflage becomes lessened to an almost astounding degree.</td><td>比如说，甚至悬浮(levitation)也在很大程度上涉及到伪装，因为伪装的躯体本身向上升起，但我们在这里仍然使用伪装的身体形态。没有伪装的身体形态的移动当然是一个巨大的迈进，但根据你们的发展，这是可能的。但这里，你们是在穿越伪装的空间。以你们的层次，不用任何伪装而要做到是非常困难的，但这可以做到，再次地，这里心理时间的运用极其重要，因为当心理时间运用到极致的时候，伪装就会减少到几乎惊人的程度。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here, Jane tapped on my desk for emphasis.Her delivery had slowed up somewhat by now, proceeding at the pace of the last two sessions.)</td><td>(在这里，珍拍了拍我的桌子，以示强调。现在她的语速稍缓，按照前两节课的速度进行。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am not going to give you any lessons for levitation, any more than I gave Ruburt lessons in clairvoyance.Your own development and your own rate of assimilation will be the rule, as far as the movement of camouflage objects through camouflage space is concerned.Again, you are dealing with camouflage.You move camouflage objects through the use of your inner senses constantly without your own conscious knowledge.The trick is not to learn how, but to recognize the occurrence, and with practice this is possible.</td><td>我不会给你们上任何悬浮的课，不会比我在千里眼方面给鲁柏的课还多。就伪装物体在伪装空间中移动而言，你自己的发展和你自己的同化速率(rateofassimilation)将会是准则。再一次，你正在和伪装打交道。你在自己没有意识到的情况下，不断地通过使用你的内在感官在移动伪装对象。诀窍不在于学会怎么)做，而在于认识到发生的情况，通过练习，这是可能的。</td></tr><tr><td>I must say that I am somewhat of an old reprobate myself, at least enough to enjoy Ruburt's spring-like attire.Like Ruburt I enjoy the wild wind, and there were many nights when we three walked down spring streets together.</td><td>我得说，我自己多少有点老朽，至少老朽到很欣赏鲁柏这身春意盎然的打扮。和鲁柏一样我很喜欢狂野的风，有很多个夜晚，我们仨人一起走在春季的街道上。</td></tr><tr><td>("In Boston?"</td><td>("在波士顿吗？"</td></tr><tr><td>(I tried to lead Seth on, as I do periodically just for my own amusement.Seth-Jane did not answer my question, as usual; but the superior, you-should-know-better look Jane threw my way made me laugh aloud.)</td><td>(我试图诱导赛斯，我偶尔为了找乐就会这么做。赛斯-珍像往常一样，没有回答我的问题；不过珍丢给我一副你别傻了的傲慢表情，逗得我大笑。)</td></tr><tr><td>In Denmark and in other places.I suggest you take your break before you break me up.</td><td>在丹麦和其他地方。我建议你在让我崩溃[break]之前，先休息[break]一下吧。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26.Jane was fairly dissociated.Seth’s reference to wild spring weather probably came because while delivering the above material Jane paused often before the open living room window.It was indeed a beautiful night.</td><td>(9:26休息。珍相当解离。赛斯说到户外的春天气候，大概是因为在传递上述资料时，珍经常在客厅敞开的窗前停顿下来。这的确是一个美丽的夜晚。</td></tr><tr><td>(We discussed some recent dreams we had had; and while doing so Jane stood up and abruptly began dictating again.Her voice was normal, her delivery slow.Resume at 9:30.)</td><td>(我们讨论了最近做的一些梦，正在说着时，珍突然站起来，又开始传述。她的声音很正常，语速很慢。九)点半继续)。</td></tr><tr><td>The universe is expanding in the way that a dream expands.In other words this expansion has nothing to do with your (underline) idea of space.The expansion, in a most basic manner, is more like the expansion of an idea.It has nothing to do with space or time in the manner in which you are accustomed to think of them.I told you earlier that your scientist's idea of an expanding universe was in error, although in one important sense the universe was expanding, and this is what I referred to.</td><td>宇宙以梦扩展的方式在扩展着。换句话说，这种扩展与你们的空间概念(下划线)无关。扩展，以最基本的方式来说，更像是一个理念(idea)的扩展。它与你们习惯认为的空间或时间无关。我之前告诉过你们，你们的科学家关于宇宙扩展的观点是错误的，但是在一个重要的意义上，宇宙在扩展，这就是我想说的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again Jane rapped on my desk.In the following material I will underline a few of the points of emphasis she made.)</td><td>(珍再次在我的桌子上拍了拍。在接下来的资料中，我会在她强调的几个重点下面划线。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your own dream world expands constantly.Your ideas expand constantly, but your ideas have nothing to do with space, and the manner in which the universe constantly expands has nothing to do with your idea of space.True space, fifth dimensional space, has abilities of expansion that do not need space, not in your terms.</td><td>你们自己的梦世界不断扩展。你们的思想观念不断扩展，但你们的思想观念与空间无关，而宇宙不断扩展的方式也与你们的空间观念无关。真正的空间，第五维度(fifthdimensional)空间，具有的扩展能力是不需要空间的，不需要你们所说的空间。</td></tr><tr><td>There is no method of measurement at your command to enable you to ascertain exactly what I am referring to, yet perhaps this will make it somewhat understandable.I will use, Joseph, an example having to do with your own profession.</td><td>你没有任何评量的方法，可以让你用来确认我指的是什么。约瑟，我将举一个与你的职业有关的例子，也)许这可让它变得稍微可以理解。</td></tr><tr><td>Take two paintings of the same shape and size; that is, two paintings that take up the same amount of space in your universe.One painting is extremely crude and poorly done.The other painting not only seems of superior quality, but also appears to undergo a continual transformation while still taking up the same amount of space.</td><td>以两幅形状大小相同的画为例；也就是说，两幅画在你们的宇宙中占据了相同的空间。一幅画极其粗糙，做工也很拙劣。另一幅画不仅看起来质量上乘，而且似乎还在不断地发生着变化，而所占据的空间仍然是一样的。</td></tr><tr><td>Say that the painting is a landscape, and that this transformation includes within the same amount of space the addition continually of more trees, more hills; that the hills still within the same amount of space allotted to the painting grow taller, and yet never shoot past the frame.Imagine this transformation including also the addition of distance, reaching ever further backward while not disturbing the back side of the canvas.</td><td>就说那是一幅风景画，这种变化包括在同样的空间内不断增加更多的树木、更多的山丘；山丘仍然在分配给这幅画的同样空间内增高，但永远不会越出画框。想像一下，这种转变还包括距离的增加，在不干扰画布背面的前提下，不断向后延伸。</td></tr><tr><td>Imagine if you can the figures or inhabitants in the painting having psychological reality, all within the set limits prescribed by the given space.Imagine in other words consciousness, growth, reality and expansion, having nothing to do with expansion of space in your terms, but an almost complete freedom of psychological realities, and you will come at least within the realm of understanding what I mean by an expanding universe that has nothing to do with the expanding universe of which your scientists speak.</td><td>如果可以的话，想像一下画中的人物或居民有其心理的实相，并全都在这给定的空间所设定的范围之内。换句话说，想像意识、生长、实相和扩展，与你们所说的空间扩展无关，而是在心理实相上拥有几乎完全的自由，那么你至少会有点了解，我说一个扩展中的宇宙，它和你们科学家讲的扩展中的宇宙毫不相干是)什么意思。</td></tr><tr><td>Most realities have absolutely nothing to do with space as you imagine it.Most realities have their growth and existence in something closely akin to what we have called psychological time, and this is completely independent of space as you conceive it to be.Psychological time is a sort of climate or environment conducive to the existence of all consciousness.</td><td>大部分的实相与你们想像的空间一点关系都没有。大多数实相的成长和存在都与我们所说的心理时间密切相关，而这完全独立于你们所设想的空间。心理时间是一种有利于所有意识存在的环境。</td></tr><tr><td>You think of space as an emptiness to be filled because on your plane you fill what you call space with camouflage patterns.And I repeat: instead true space, fifth dimensional space, is the vitality and stuff of all existence itself, vital and alive, from which all other existences are woven through means which I have outlined so far in a rather sketchy fashion.Even on your plane quality, which represents a kind of expansion, does not necessarily imply an expansion of space.The universe expands continually in a qualitative manner that has nothing to do with space as it is usually envisioned.And the expansion is more vivid and valid than I can possibly explain to you at this time.</td><td>你们认为，空间是一种有待填充的空无，因为在你们的层面上，你们用伪装模式填充你们所谓的空间。我再重复一遍：相反，真正的空间，第五维空间，就是所有存在本身的生命力和那些材料，生机盎然，活力四射，所有其他的存在，都是通过我迄今为止，以相当概略勾勒的方式，从中编织而出。即使在你们层面的质性(planequality)，代表着一种扩展，也不一定意味着是空间的扩张。宇宙不断地以一种质的方式(qualitativemanner)扩展，与通常设想的空间无关。而这种扩展比我现在能向你们解释的更加生动和有效。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break.We managed to get some excellent material through so far, for which I am most thankful, and the quality of the material just given transcended your time and space, the expansion of quality in this case existing independently.</td><td>我建议休息一会儿。到目前为止，我们成功地取得了一些很棒的资料，对此我非常感谢，刚才所提供的资料之质量，超越了你们的时间和空间，在这种情况下，质量的扩展是独立存在的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane gestured dramatically, arms o</td><td>(现在珍做了个戏剧性的手势，甩开双臂，眼睛很黑。)</td></tr><tr><td>The walls of the room do not push back to receive a great idea, for example, and again, the expansion of the universe from the inside does not imply a pushing out or an inflation.</td><td>比如说，房间的墙壁不会为了接收一个伟大的想法而往后推移，同样的，宇宙从内部开始的扩展，并不意味着是向外推挤或膨胀。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:58.Jane was dissociated—way out, she said.Also her hands felt fat again.She wears two rings, one on each fourth finger.Both came off easily, normally.Now she could not remove her wedding ring at all; the other ring finally came off at the expense of a bruised knuckle.</td><td>(9:58休息。珍解离了——神飘得很远，她说。而且她觉得手又胖了。她戴着两枚戒指，两根无名指上各一枚。通常两枚都很容易拿下来。现在，她的婚戒根本摘不下来，另一枚戒指终于拿下来了，代价是指关节瘀青。</td></tr><tr><td>(The feeling of swollen hands lasted for a couple of minutes then began to taper off.It is my own observation that Jane experiences this enlargement when she is delivering exceptional material, and she agreed.Strangely I had never asked Seth for an explanation, so now I made it a point to remark that I hoped he would deal with it this evening.Jane’s hands felt normal to her when she began dictating again, in a normal voice.Resume at 10:07.)</td><td>(双手肿胀的感觉持续了一两分钟，然后开始消退。据我自己的观察，珍在传送非常特殊的资料时，会有这种肿大的感觉，她也同意。奇怪的是，我从来没有请赛斯解释过，所以我现在特别提出来，希望他今晚能解释一下。当珍再度开始用正常的声音传述时，她感觉手也正常了。在10:07继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Before I answer the question that you voiced during break, Joseph, let me continue first along the lines of our discussion.Again, the dream worldd, which is a very vivid one and a valid one, does not take up any space at all.It is also free to a very large degree of your physical time, but it does exist in the climate or environment of psychological time.</td><td>在我回答你在休息期间所提出的问题之前，约瑟，让我先继续我们之前的讨论。再说一遍，梦境世界，是一个非常生动、有效、根本不占任何空间的世界。它在很大程度上也不受限于你们的物理时间，但它确实存在于心理时间的气候或环境中。</td></tr><tr><td>Your certainly cannot pinpoint a dream location, even if the location corresponds to a familiar one in the camouflage universe.The dream itself is not experienced in the specific camouflage location.The body lies in its bed.Though you recognize in a dream the complete furnishings of an actual house, still the dreamer lies in his bed.The two locations, the dream location and the camouflage location, appear the same but they are not the same.</td><td>你们当然不能确定梦境的位置，即使这个位置与伪装宇宙中熟悉的地点相一致。梦境本身并不是在特定的伪装地点经历的。身体躺在床上。虽然在梦中，你认得一个实际房子的完整陈设，但做梦者还是躺在自己的床上。梦境位置和伪装地点，这两个所在地看似相同，但它们并不一样。</td></tr><tr><td>One takes up space in your universe and the other does not.The universe expands in the manner that a dream expands, taking up no camouflage space.This does not mean that there is no growth involved in the expansion of the universe.This does not imply that there is no movement.It simply implies an existence and an expansion of a qualitative manner, beyond your present measurements or complete comprehension.</td><td>一个占用你们宇宙里的空间，另一个没有。宇宙以一个梦扩展的方式扩展，不占用伪装空间。这并不是说宇宙的扩展不涉及成长(growth)。这也不是意味着没有任何移动。它只是意味着，一种质的存在和扩展，超出了你们目前的测量或完整的理解。</td></tr><tr><td>The most full operation of the inner senses is possible only in this climate.There is so much here that I am impatient to tell you, and so little that you can understand now.Conceptions explode into being, evolve, change into something else, and yet all this within a framework that is definite but cannot be seen or touched by you, the psychological expansion even of atoms and molecules that in themselves contain condensed comprehensions beyond your understanding.The stuff of the universe is not inanimate, nor even on your plane is it an emptiness to be filled, but constantly expanding in ways that you cannot yet fathom.</td><td>内在感官只有在这种环境中才能全面运作。这里有太多东西我迫不及待地想要告诉你们，但你们现在能够了解的太少了。孕育的概念爆发成了存在的东西，经过演化，变成其他东西，然而这一切都在一个明确的架构内，但你们却看不见、摸不着，甚至原子和分子的心理扩展，本身就包含超出你们能理解的浓缩的理解力(condensedcomprehensions)。宇宙的种种东西并非无生命的，甚至在你们的层面上，它也不是有待填充的空无，而是以你们还无法揣摩的方式不断扩展。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane stood again at the open window, looking out as she dictated.)</td><td>(珍又站在敞开的窗前，一边传述一边看着窗外。)</td></tr><tr><td>Even as Ruburt looks out the window, seemingly through empty space at the street, the so-called space simply is not empty, though through the specialized camouflage senses it may appear to be empty.Your outer senses merely equip you to perceive your own camouflage, but to others your camouflage may in some cases appear as empty space, while what is empty to you is filled with activity for them.</td><td>即使当鲁伯看着窗外，似乎是通过空旷的空间看向街道，这所谓的空间根本就不是空的，虽然通过专门的伪装感官，它可能看起来是空的。你们的外在感官，只是配备给你们来感知你们自己的伪装，但对其他人来说，你们的伪装在某些情况下可能看起来是空的，而对你们来说是空的地方，对他们来说却充满了活动。</td></tr><tr><td>Your scientists’ idea of an expanding universe is so dependent upon your own limited theories that it becomes very difficult to make the matter plain.Again I entreat you to practice with the use of psychological time, for here the inner senses are given the greatest freedom from camouflage.And experiencing the resulting inner expansion, you will perhaps come somewhat closer to the ideas involved in our real expanding universe.</td><td>你们的科学家关于宇宙膨胀的想法，是如此依赖你们自己有限的理论，以至于变得很难把这件事说个明白。我再次恳请你们练习运用心理时间，因为在这里，内在感官被赋予了最大自由，不需要伪装。而且也体验到因此而来的内在扩展，你们或许就会稍微比较接近和我们真正的宇宙扩展有关的观念。</td></tr><tr><td>The dream analogy is also very helpful here, and I suggest that you read it carefully.</td><td>梦比喻在这里也非常有帮助，我建议你们仔细阅读。</td></tr><tr><td>As far as Ruburt’s fat hands and your own are concerned, this is in a very limited manner a hint of the qualities of extension that can be expected.This is of an entirely different kind of experience, having nothing to do with our discussion immediately previous.This extension involves a reaching out of tissue capsule.The degree is rather limited, the opposite experience being one of contraction.This can be compared most clearly to a pulsation, or really a beat that can follow a more or less regular rhythm.</td><td>至于鲁柏的胖手和你自己的手，就一个非常有限的意义来说，这是暗示可以期待的延伸性质。这是一种完全不同的体验，和我们刚才的讨论没有任何关系。这种延伸涉及组织囊的外展。程度相当有限，相反的经验是一种收缩。这可以非常清楚地比作一个脉动，或者说是一个可以遵循多少是有规律节奏的节拍。</td></tr><tr><td>It involves the inner self, and the tissue capsule which also surrounds the physical camouflage body in a manner and for a purpose which I have briefly explained in an earlier session.</td><td>它涉及到内在自己，以及组织囊，组织囊也以一种方式和目的围绕着物质伪装身体，我在前面的课程中已经简单解释过。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take a break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:32.Jane was dissociated as usual.Resume at 10:38.)</td><td>(10:32休息。珍解离如常。在10:38继续)</td></tr><tr><td>Briefly let me mention that transportation in the universe, that is transportation as such, is basically unnecessary.This is only a preliminary statement for other sessions, and I will not go into it deeply at this time.</td><td>我简单提一下，宇宙中的运输[transportation]，也就是说，这样的运输，基本上是不必要的。这只是为其他课程所做的初步陈述，我这时候不打算深入讨论它。</td></tr><tr><td>When, or by the time that transportation difficulties are solved, you will no longer need transportation.Use of the inner senses makes transportation as you think of it completely unnecessary, since complete use of the inner senses amounts to communication to a degree so near perfect and so independent of so-called space, that transportation through space in those terms becomes an outmoded method of communication.</td><td>当，或者到了运输的困难被解决了的时候，你们就不再需要运输了。内在感官的运用，会使你认为的运输完全没有必要，因为内在感官的全面运用，使得沟通到达一个几近完美的程度，而且如此独立于所谓的空间，以至于在这些方面，穿过空间的运输变成一种过时的沟通方法。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner senses provide their own "transportation," and put that in quotes.Transportation as such is valid only within a space framework and within a time concept, such as those on your own plane.The "transportation" (in quotes) of the inner senses consists mainly of what you might call a changing of frequencies or vibrations or pulsations, a transformation of vitality-form from one particular pattern or aspect to another.</td><td>内在感官提供它们自己的"运输"，把它放在引号里。这样的运输(穿过空间的运输)只有在空间架构内及时间概念内有效，比如你们自己层面上的那些。内在感官的"运输"(加引号)主要包括你们可称之为频率、振动、或脉动的变化，是生命力形式从一个特定)的模式或面向到另一个的转变。</td></tr><tr><td>The movement through space is a distortion.I expect to say much more about this in further sessions, as it is extremely important; and you can see now perhaps why our eighth sense, disentanglement, is so important, since the inner self must disentangle itself from a particular camouflage before it can change.It must ignore, so to speak, one set of camouflage and be able to either adopt another smoothly or to dispense with camouflage entirely.</td><td>穿过空间的移动是一种扭曲，我预计在以后的课程中对此作更多的说明，因为它极其重要；你们现在或许可以看出，为什么我们的第八种内在感官---脱离纠结，是这么重要了，因为内在自己必须在它能够改变之前，先脱离一个特定的伪装。可以这样说，它必须忽略一套伪装，并且能够顺利地采用另一套，或者完全摒弃伪装。</td></tr><tr><td>The grouping of inner senses with which we are now concerned deal with the disentanglement of one set of camouflage patterns and the taking up of another set.The groupings of inner senses most dependent upon the use of psychological time are those which involve a nearly complete disentanglement from camouflage pattern, without taking on other patterns, and these are perhaps the most important because they come closer to the direct experience of unveiled reality.</td><td>我们现在所关注的这组内在感官，处理的是脱离一套伪装模式的纠结，并采用另一套模式。最依赖于使用心理时间的那组内在感官，就是涉及几近完全脱离伪装模式的纠缠，且不必采用其他模式的那些内在感官，而且这些也许是最重要的，因为它们更接近于对揭开的实相的直接体验。</td></tr><tr><td>In some ways you see, your dream worldd is actually much closer to the direct experience of reality than is your waking world, where the operation of the inner senses is shielded so from your own awareness.This is not to say that the dream worldd is more important to you in your present situation, merely that it contains more truth about the source of your own existence.</td><td>在某些方面，你的梦世界，实际上比你的醒时世界更接近实相的直接经验，在醒时世界，你内在感官的运作被你自己的意识所屏蔽。这并不是说，在你目前的)情况下，梦世界对你更重要，只是说，它包含了更多关于你自己存在源头的真相。</td></tr><tr><td>You will find that we have covered some excellent points here this evening, that will be most helpful in further discussions.There are other facets that I will take up but at a later time.I am looking forward to summer discussions.Maybe Ruburt will even wear a bathing suit.</td><td>你会发现，今晚，我们在这里已经涵盖了一些极佳的重点，这对进一步的讨论很有帮助。还有其他一些方面，我会在以后的时间进行介绍。我期待着在夏日里的讨论。鲁柏或许会穿着泳衣呢。</td></tr><tr><td>("Maybe.")</td><td>("也许"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Again let me mention that you in particular, Joseph, had a much more pleasant winter than you would have enjoyed without the knowledge of your own present personality gained from our sessions.I suggest you take a brief break.</td><td>让我再次提一下，特别是你，约瑟，由于从我们的课程中获得了对你现在人格的认识，你的冬日过得比从前愉快多了。我建议休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:00.Jane was dissociated as usual.Once again we discussed a subject we hoped Seth would mention after break.This time it was Jane's clairvoyant experience of April 10.See page 1.Jane resumed dictation in a normal voice at 11:05.)</td><td>(11:00休息。珍解离如常。我们再次讨论了一个我们希望赛斯休息后会提到的话题。这一次是珍4月10日的遥视经验。见本节开头。珍用正常声音于11:05继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>The pulsating that I mentioned earlier as extension and contraction involves the use of certain frequencies inherent in the tissue capsule, and to some small degree represents or is a limited aspect of the ability of the inner self to change frequencies and pulsations in an even freer, less limited manner.I wanted to make this point earlier.</td><td>我前面提到的扩展和收缩的脉动，涉及到组织囊内某些特定频率的使用，在小小的程度上代表了，或者说)是内在自己能力的一个有限的面向，以一种甚至更自由、更不受限的方式，改变频率和脉冲。我稍早前想说的就是这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt’s experience with the slip of paper represented a clairvoyance, as did his experience with the clock; and clairvoyance is concerned with camouflage pattern.Telepathy for example is not.In further experiences of this kind, Ruburt will be able to "see" (in quotes) more as his ability grows.</td><td>鲁柏对那张纸的经验代表了一次千里眼的体验，就像他的钟表经验一样；千里眼涉及到伪装模式。心灵感应则否。这类经验再进一步，随着能力的增强，鲁柏将能"看到"(引号)更多。</td></tr><tr><td>The piece of paper was, as he saw it, written in the hand of Durosha Piry.It was on a desk.The notation mentioned your name, along with other names of artists whose works were under consideration by that woman to be placed in business offices.</td><td>他看见的这张纸，是杜罗莎.皮里(DuroshaPiry)的手迹。在一张桌子上。注释中提到了你的名字，还有其他艺术家的名字，那个女人考虑把他们的作品放在办公室。</td></tr><tr><td>(The formal name of Dee Masters, Jane’s supervisor at the gallery is Durosha Piry Masters.)</td><td>(珍在画廊的主管，迪·马斯特斯(DeeMasters)的全名是杜罗莎.皮里.马斯特斯。)</td></tr><tr><td>The notation was on a desk in the woman’s apartment, and Ruburt had not seen it, and was not familiar with it in the ordinary fashion.I will not go into this any more deeply now, because your name was involved, Joseph.Ruburt "saw" (in quotes) the slip of paper, and he was not able to read the rest of it simply because your name was not mentioned again and there was no further information on the paper; merely names, and he had no more emotional incentive.</td><td>这张字条放在那个女人公寓的书桌上，而鲁柏没有见过它，而且在一般情况下，也不熟悉它。约瑟，现在我不会再多谈这件事，只因为上面有你的名字。鲁柏"看到"(加引号)那张纸，没能看见其余的内容，只因为纸上没有再提到你的名字，也没有进一步的信息；只是一些人名，所以他没有更多的情感诱因。</td></tr><tr><td>I hope that you will develop along these lines, but the rate of progress is of course up to you, and your individual abilities will vary as to particulars.This is to be expected.As a rule the use of psychological time will help you both develop in a fairly balanced manner.I have enjoyed this evening’s session.After some more material with our inner senses perhaps we shall take some time out to go into your various life readings, as I have let them go to get other material to you.</td><td>我希望你们朝着这些方向发展，但进展速度当然取决于你们，你们的个人能力在细节上会有所不同。这是可以预料的。一般来说，心理时间的运用有助于你们两人以一种相当平衡的方式发展。我很享受今天晚上的课。再说一点我们的内在感官资料之后，也许我们应该分出一些时间来详谈你们各自的生命解读，我把它们放在一边，为的是给你们一些其他的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>Incidentally, though I promised, didn’t I, that I wouldn’t meddle, I do think that your idea, camping weekends during the summer, is an excellent one.And also that you have made a good decision as far as Artistic is concerned, particularly in that you requested more money.You have to be able to afford all the paper to record our sessions.</td><td>顺便说一句，虽然我答应过，我不会多管闲事，但我确实认为，在夏日的周末去露营的点子很棒。而且，就你上班的艺术卡公司(Artistic)而言，你做了一个很好的决定，尤其是你要求更多的酬劳。你一定要买得起那么多的纸来记录我们的课。</td></tr><tr><td>("Right."</td><td>("没错"。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane-Seth smiled, leaning over my desk.)</td><td>(珍-赛斯笑了，俯身在我的桌上。)</td></tr><tr><td>Joking aside, you will no longer feel put upon at Artistic, and perhaps you can see now that it would have been perfectly acceptable to have made your demand for more money at a much earlier date, since the demand was certainly justified for value received.</td><td>玩笑归玩笑，你再也不会觉得被艺术卡公司(Artistic)占了便宜，也许你现在看得出来，要是你早早要求更多的酬劳，也是完全可以被接受的，因为对于收到的)价值来说，这种要求肯定是合理的。</td></tr><tr><td>(For three years I worked full time for Artistic Card Co.I then left their employment for a year.Recently I took a part-time job with them at a rather large increase in salary.This gives me afternoons free to paint, and is a very satisfactory arrangement.)</td><td>(我曾为艺术卡公司ArtisticCardCo全职工作了三年。然后我离开了那里一年。最近，我在他们那里做了一份兼职工作，工资增加了不少。这使我下午可以自由作画，是一个非常满意的安排。)</td></tr><tr><td>May I rejoice with you?You may put this in the record or not, you will not have children, for reasons that I have explained.It is possible within the realms of free will, but not probable.</td><td>我可以与你一块儿庆祝吗？你可以把这记录下来或者不记录，你们将不会有孩子，理由我已经解释过了。在自由意志的范围内仍是有可能，但不是非常有可能。</td></tr><tr><td>And now my dear friends, I wish you a fond and even joyful good evening.</td><td>现在，我亲爱的朋友，我祝你们有一个美好甚至是快乐的夜晚。</td></tr><tr><td>("And the same to you, Seth, )</td><td>("你也一样，赛斯。)</td></tr><tr><td>As always I dislike leaving you, but after Ruburt paces up and down and utters my monologue steadily for such long periods of time, and after you scribble away my immortal words so furiously, then I know that you must be glad for a rest.</td><td>像往常一样，我不喜欢离开你们，但在鲁柏来回踱步，平稳地说出我的独白如此长的时间之后，也在你这么拼命地奋笔疾书，记下我不朽的名言之后，我知道你们一定很高兴，终于可以休息了。</td></tr><tr><td>("What are you going to do now?After you leave us?"</td><td>("你现在要做什么？在你离开我们之后？"</td></tr><tr><td>(This is another question I like to throw at Seth, and it's another one he has yet to answer.)</td><td>(这是我很喜欢扔给赛斯的另一个问题，也是他至今尚未回答的另一个问题。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am not going to do what you are going to do.I will discuss my comings and goings, if not to your complete satisfaction, at least enough to quiet you for a while, but at a later date.</td><td>我不会做你要去做的事。我会讨论我的来来去去，即使不能让你完全满意，至少也可以让你闭嘴一阵子，但过些日子再说。</td></tr><tr><td>("Oh.")</td><td>("哦"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps we will take a good part of a session for it.</td><td>也许我们将用掉大半节的课去说它。</td></tr><tr><td>("That sounds good.")</td><td>("听起来不错"。)</td></tr><tr><td>And in the meantime bear with me.I will say that some of your camouflages are utterly delightful, and sometimes when I return in some way I yearn again for spring and warm windy

enlargement in my right hand.)</td><td>(11:32结束。珍解离如常。她的手，仍然有稍微地变大，结婚戒指摘不掉。而我的右手也有变大的迹)象。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 44</td><td>第44节内在宇宙法则1,2,3,4</td></tr><tr><td>APRIL 15, 1964 9 PM WEDNESDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964年4月15日星期三晚上9点，按指示</td></tr><tr><td>(At 11:00 AM today, while relaxing briefly Jane experienced what she believes to be another attempt at clairvoyance.Behind her closed eyes the customary blackness began to turn gray, then white, or light; she saw finally a milky diffused light, as though she was looking at a frosted glass.She saw nothing else, she said, although she definitely had the feeling that it was possible for this opaque light to turn transparent, and thus allow her to see things.</td><td>(今天上午11:00，当珍在短暂的放松时，她认为又经历了一次千里眼的尝试。在她紧闭的双眼背后，通常的黑暗变成了灰色，然后变成白色，或是变亮了，最后她看见一道扩散的乳白色的光，就像她在看一片磨砂玻璃那样。她说除此之外，她看不到其他东西，不过，她很确定她有一种感觉，这道不透明的光可能会变透明，从而让她看到东西。</td></tr><tr><td>(At 8:40 PM Jane lay down for a brief rest, while I sat quietly in an attempt to use psychological time.I experienced nothing untoward; Jane however got the thought of dream locations taking up no space.I called her at 8:55.She felt somewhat relaxed, she said, and not as nervous.</td><td>(晚上8:40，珍躺下休息，我静静地坐着，试图运用心理时间。我没有经验到任何出乎意料的情况；不过，珍却有了梦境地点不占据空间的想法。8:55我叫醒他。她说，她感觉有些放松，没有那么紧张。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane began dictating in a rather normal voice and at her regular rate, but before long her delivery slowed down once again.This slower rhythm has been so prevalent in recent sessions that it appears to be becoming the rule.It does make it easier to take notes.Her eyes darkened as usual.</td><td>(珍用相当正常的声音和速度开始传述，不过没多久，她的传述再度慢了下来。这种比较缓慢的节奏在最近的课中经常发生，几乎成了惯例。这倒使我做笔记更容易一些。她眼睛漆黑如常。</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening, playmates.</td><td>晚安，玩伴们。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am pleased that you are so pleased with our last session.I was in fact going to speak about dream locations, in that you definitely experience these locations in your dreams, which take up no room in your space.</td><td>我很高兴你对我们上一节课如此满意。事实上，我正是要谈论梦境地点，因为你们的确在梦中经历了这些地点，这些地点不占你们的空间。</td></tr><tr><td>On one level they could be said not to exist, and yet they do exist.While in your dream, you are able to see and touch and move about in these locations.It is only when you awake that they escape you.This should be considered along with our material on the expanding universe, since dream locations represent, certainly, a reality, even a framework that has no existence in your space; and measured purely along the lines used to measure your space, you would receive no hint at all of their existence or reality.Measured purely in terms of your camouflage conceptions, many things which you know to exist would seem not to exist.</td><td>在某个层次上，它们可说是子虚乌有的，然而它们又确实存在。当你在梦中时，你能够看到、触摸到，并在这些地方走动。只有当你醒来时，它们才会逃逸。这应该和我们谈宇宙扩展的资料一起考虑，因为梦中的地点当然代表了一个实相，甚至有一个不存在于你们空间里的架构；纯粹按照用来测量你们的空间的惯用标准来测量，你们根本不会收到有关它们存在或它们实相的任何线索。纯粹按照你们的伪装概念来衡量，许多你们知道存在的事物似乎就不存在了。</td></tr><tr><td>You cannot deny your own psychological reality, but sometimes it seems as if you would if you could.You cannot feel outwardly, or see or measure, an emotion, and an emotion takes up no space.Emotions still exist.Feelings intensify.In value they can be said to expand, yet this very real intensity or value expansion of a feeling takes up no more additional space than it did at its conception.</td><td>你无法否认你自己的心理实相，但有时似乎如果你能否认，你会否认。你无法从外面去感受、或者看见、衡量一种情绪，情绪不占空间。情绪仍然存在。感觉加剧。在值(value)上，它们可以说是扩张的，然而这种非常真实的强度或值的扩展，所占据的空间，并不比它在孕育概念时占用更多的额外空间。</td></tr><tr><td>The color red is more vivid than the color black, using black here as color.However red takes up no more space than black.In other words expansion, occurring in terms of value quality, or gradations of intensity, has nothing to do with expansion in space.And expansion of value and intensity is the only real form of expansion.</td><td>红色这个颜色比黑色更鲜艳。然而红色并不比黑色占用更多的空间。换句话说，扩展的发生，就值的特性，或强度的等级而言，与空间的扩展无关。而值与强度的扩展是唯一真实的扩展形式。</td></tr><tr><td>I have said that the mind cannot be detected by your instruments at present.The mind does not take up space, and yet the mind is the value that gives power to the brain.The mind expands continually, both in individual terms and in terms of the species as a whole, and yet the mind takes up neither more nor less space, whether it be the mind of a flea or a man.</td><td>我说过，目前你们的仪器无法探测到心智。心智并不占据空间，但心智却是赋予头脑力量的那个值(value)。无论是从个体还是从整个物种的角度来看，心智都在不断地扩展，无论是跳蚤或人的心智，都不会占用更多或更少的空间。</td></tr><tr><td>The mind simply does not exist in spatial terms.You have no way of measuring the mind's expansion, any more than you can measure the expansion of the universe as long as you are thinking in terms of expansion in space.To deny the reality of what does not exist in space would be to deny much of mankind's own heritage and abilities.</td><td>心智根本不以空间的方式存在。只要你们一直从空间扩展的角度思考，就没有办法测量心智的扩展，也无法测量宇宙的扩展。否认在空间中不存在实相这个事情，就等于否认人类自身的很多传承和能力。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, the dream worldd exists in a very personal, vivid and valid manner, but the dream worldd does not take up so many inches or feet or yards or acres.</td><td>再说一次，梦世界以一种非常个人、生动又有效的方式存在，但梦世界并不会占用这么多英寸、或英尺或码或英亩。</td></tr><tr><td>Now we get into something else.</td><td>现在，我们进入另一个话题。</td></tr><tr><td>If the dream worldd exists, and it does, and if it does not exist in space, then in what, or where, does it have its existence, and what paths if any will lead us to it?</td><td>如果梦世界存在，而它也确实存在，如果它不存在于空间，那么，它存在于什么，或是在哪里存在？要是有路径的话，什么路径会把我们引向它？</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane tapped on my desk for emphasis.She spoke quite slowly.Also throughout these first few pages, I believe I experienced quite a few instances of telepathy; I would catch a phrase for instance just before Jane uttered the same words.)</td><td>(珍拍了拍我的桌子以示强调。她说得很慢。前面这几页从头到尾，我相信我经历了好几次心灵感应：比方说，在珍开口之前，我会捕捉到一模一样的字)句。)</td></tr><tr><td>Since I have also said that basically the universe has no more to do with space in your terms than does the dream worldd, you may deduce a similarity between the medium in which both the basic universe and the dream worldd may be found.You must understand here that your idea of space is something quite different from the reality of our fifth dimensional space.I want to make this plain again before we continue.</td><td>我还说过，基本上，宇宙与你们所说的空间，并没有比梦世界与你们所说的空间，有更多的关系，那么你们可以从基本宇宙和梦世界都可能存在的媒介中，推断出一种相似性。这里你们必须明白，你们的空间观念，和我们第五维空间的实相很不一样。在我们继续下去之前，我想再把这一点说清楚。</td></tr><tr><td>Your idea of space is some completely erroneous conception of an emptiness to be filled.Things, planets, stars, nebulae, come into being in this universe of yours.They are born continually according to your latest theories, and this universe expands—pushed, so to speak, so that its sides bulge, the outer galaxies literally bursting out into nowhere.True fifth-dimensional space, as I have said often, is to the contrary vital energy, itself alive, possessing endless abilities of transformation, forming all existences, forming even the camouflage universe with which you are familiar, and which you attempt to probe so ineffectively.</td><td>你们认为空间是一个有待填补的空无，这是个完全错误的概念。物体、星球、恒星、星云，这些东西在你们的这个宇宙中形成。根据你们最新的理论，它们不断地诞生，这个宇宙也不断地膨胀—被推着(pushed)，可以这么说，以至于，其周边凸起，外围的星系简直是迸发到了无边无际。真正的第五维空间，就像我经常说的那样，正好相反，是生命能量(vitalenergy)，它本身是活的，拥有无尽的转换能力，形成所有的存在，甚至形成你们所熟悉的，试图探究却徒劳无功的伪装宇宙。</td></tr><tr><td>This fifth dimensional space, this basic universe of reality of which I speak, expands constantly in terms of intensity and quality and value, in a way that has nothing to do with your idea of space.</td><td>这第五维空间，这个我所说的实相的基本宇宙，在强度、特性和值上不断地扩展，这种扩展方式与你们的空间观念毫无关系。</td></tr><tr><td>The basic inner universe beneath all camouflage does not have an existence in space at all, as you envision it.Space as you envision it, that is as an emptiness to be filled, is a camouflage.</td><td>在所有伪装之下的基本内在宇宙(basicinneruniverse)，根本不是如你们所设想的那样存在于空间。你们所设想的空间，也就是一个有待填补的空无，是一种伪装。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take your first break.</td><td>我建议你们第一次休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:31.Jane was dissociated as usual.She said Seth came through clear as a bell.Her voice had become very quiet, her pacing slow.She resumed dictating in the same manner at 9:35.)</td><td>(9:31休息。珍解离如常。她说，赛斯传来的声音，像铃声般清晰无比。她的声音变得很安静，踱步很)慢。9:35。她以同样的方式继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>Dreams, the dream worldd, these do not exist to any real degree in time as you know time.Weeks may be experienced in a dream, and the dream may take but a split second of your clock time.The inner thoughts of the mind exist but briefly in time, and even this small tinge of time that touches both dreams and ideas is not basic to either the dream or the idea.</td><td>梦，梦世界，在你所知的时间里，不存在任何真实程度的时间。在梦里可能经历了几个星期，而这个梦可能只用了你钟表时间的一瞬间。心智的内在想法)(innerthoughtsofthemind)在时间上只是瞬间的存在，即使是触及梦与念头的这一丁点时间，对梦或念头也都不是基本的。</td></tr><tr><td>This tinge of time is an attribute of the physical camouflage form only, and even then the relationship between time and ideas, and time and dreams, is a nebulous one.As I have mentioned, though you experience two days in a dream, you are while in that dream free from the time involved, in that you do not age two days, although you have psychologically experienced that apparent time.</td><td>这一丁点时间只是物质伪装形式的一个属性，就算这样，时间和念头(ideas)之间的关系，以及时间和梦之间的关系也是模糊的。我说过，虽然你在梦中经历了两天，但你在那个梦中是没有涉及到时间的，因为你虽然在心理上经历了那明显的时间，但你并没有老了两天。</td></tr><tr><td>The dream worldd and the mind are touched by time, and exist in it only in so far as these realities dip into the camouflage universe.Basically both the dream worldd and the ideas of the inner mind do not have their existence in time, although they may be visible from the perspective of time, viewed from the physical form.</td><td>唯有在这些实相浸入(dipinto)伪装宇宙时，梦世界和心智才会被时间触及，才存在于时间之中。基本上，梦世界和内在心智的想法(theideasoftheinnermind)都不在时间中存在，虽然从时间的角度，从物质形态上来看，它们可能是可见的。</td></tr><tr><td>The reality of the inner universe also does not exist basically in time as you conceive it, although in some instances parts of it may be glimpsed from the camouflage time perspective; only however a very small portion.</td><td>内在宇宙的实相也基本上不存在于你们所设想的时间之内，尽管在某些情况下，从伪装时间的角度，可能瞥见它的局部；然而仅仅是很小的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>If the dream worldd and the mind and the inner universe do exist, and if they do not exist in space, and if they do not exist basically in time, though they may be glimpsed through time, then your question will be:in what medium or in what manner do they exist; and without time how can they be said to exist in duration?</td><td>如果梦世界、心智和内在宇宙确实存在，如果它们不存在于空间，如果它们又基本上不存在于时间，尽管它们可能通过时间被瞥见，那么你的疑问会是：它们以什么媒介或方式存在；没有时间，那怎么能说它们存在于一段持续时间(induration)中呢？</td></tr><tr><td>You already have many clues that I have given you.The answer itself should not seem unbelievable.</td><td>你们已经有了很多我给你们的线索。答案本身不应该显得难以置信。</td></tr><tr><td>You know for a fact that dreams exist.You know that the mind exists, you have personal intimate direct knowledge of these.</td><td>你们知道梦的确存在。你们知道心智存在，你们对这些具备个人的直接认知。</td></tr><tr><td>I am telling you that the basic universe exists behind all camouflage universes in the same manner, and taking up no space, that the mind exists behind the brain.</td><td>我是在告诉你，基本宇宙以同样的方式存在于所有伪装宇宙之后，而且不占空间，就像心智存在于头脑之后一样。</td></tr><tr><td>The brain is a camouflage pattern.It takes up space.It exists in time.The mind takes up no space, it does not have its basic existence in time.The reality of the inner universe does not take up space, nor does it have its basic existence in time.Your camouflage universe, on the other hand, takes up space and has an existence in time, but it is not the real and basic universe, any more than the brain is the mind.</td><td>头脑是一个伪装模式。它占据空间。存在于时间之中。心智不占用空间，在时间内没有它的基本存在。内在宇宙的实相不占用空间，在时间内也没有它的基)本存在。另一方面，你们的伪装宇宙占据空间，并在时间中存在，但它不是真实和基本的宇宙，就像头脑之于心智。</td></tr><tr><td>Now nevertheless the dream worldd, the mind and the reality universe do exist.They exist in a climate that we will call the value climate of psychological reality.This is the medium.This takes the place of what you call space.This value climate of psychological reality is a quality which makes all existences and consciousness possible.It is one of the most powerful principles behind or within the vitality that itself composes from itself all other phenomena.</td><td>然而，梦世界、心智和实相宇宙确实存在。它们存在于一种气候(climate)中，我们将称之为心理实相之值的气候(thevalueclimateofpsychologicalreality)。这就是媒介。这取代了你们所谓的空间。这种心理实相的值的气候是一种性质，它使所有的存在和意识成为可能。它是生命力背后或内部最强大的原则之一，而生命力本身就是从它自己本身构成了所有其他的现象。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:01.Jane was dissociated as usual.It was a very quiet and peaceful session.Jane resumed dictating in her slow and deliberate manner at 10:06.)</td><td>(10:01休息。珍解离如常。这是一节非常安静、祥和的课程。珍恢复了她缓慢而从容的传述，10:06。)</td></tr><tr><td>One of the main attributes of this value climate is spontaneity, that shows itself in the existence of the only sort of time that has any real meaning, that of the spacious present.</td><td>这个值的气候的主要属性之一是自发性(spontaneity)，这表现在唯一一种具有任何真实意义的时间的存在上，那就是广阔的现在。</td></tr><tr><td>The spacious present does not contradict the existence of durability, but durability does not imply the existence of a future as you conceive it.Now this may appear contradictory, but later I hope that you will understand this more clearly.The spacious present, while existing spontaneously, while happening simultaneously, still contains within it qualities of duration.</td><td>广阔的现在与持久性(durability)的存在并不矛盾，而持久性并不意味著有你们所设想的一个未来的存)在。现在，这可能显得很矛盾，但以后我希望你们能更清楚地理解这一点。广阔的现在，虽然是自发性的存在、同时性地发生着，但它仍然包含着持久)(duration)的品质。</td></tr><tr><td>An idea is not itself aware of past, present and future for example, and yet having no experience with present, past and future, it still endures.Nor does the duration involved in the spacious present in any way involve a suspension in terms of, for example, growth forbidden to achieve maturity.</td><td>比方说，念头本身并不知道到过去、现在和未来，然而在没有经历现在、过去和未来的情况下，它仍然会持续下去。广阔的现在所涉及的持续时间，也丝毫不涉及，例如，禁止成长以达到成熟的暂停。</td></tr><tr><td>Growth in your camouflage universe often involves the taking up of more space.Actually in our inner universe of reality growth exists in terms of the value or quality expansion of which I have spoken, and does not, I repeat, does not imply any sort of space expansion.Nor does it imply, as growth does in your camouflage universe, a sort of projection into time.</td><td>在你们的伪装宇宙内，成长往往意味着占据更多的空间。事实上，在我们实相的内在宇宙中，成长存在于我说过的值(value)或品质(quality)的扩展之内，而且没有，我再重复一遍，没有意味着任何一种空间扩展的意思。它也没有意味着，像你们伪装宇宙的成长那样，一种进入到时间的投射。</td></tr><tr><td>I realize that this material is difficult, and I am giving it to you in as simple terms as possible.If growth is one of the most necessary laws of your camouflage universe, value fulfillment corresponds to it in the inner reality universe.</td><td>我知道这个资料很难，我是用尽可能简单的术语讲给你们听。如果成长是你们伪装宇宙中最不可或缺的法则之一，那么，在内在实相宇宙中，对应于它的就是值的充盈*(valuefulfillment)(*译注:一种充值的概念，内在宇宙或整体自己，行动，创造，经验，丰盈)自身，然后再行动创新，一直在成为becoming之中，没有完成之时，这对应于伪装宇宙中的成长。)。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane came up to the table I use as a desk during sessions.With one foot on a chair, she leaned over to supervise each word I wrote.The next paragraph represents probably the longest period of time she refrained from pacing back and forth while dictating.)</td><td>(现在，珍走向我在上课期间用做书桌的桌子前。她一只脚踩在椅子上，俯身监督我写的每一个字。下一个段落，可能是她传述中，停止来回踱步时间最长的一次。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now the so-called laws of your camouflage universe do not apply to the inner universe.They do not even apply to other camouflage planes.However, the laws of the inner universe apply to all camouflage universes, and all consciousnesses on any plane must follow the basic laws of the inner universe.Some of these basic laws have counterparts known and accepted on various camouflage planes.There are various manifestations of these laws and various names given to them.</td><td>现在，你们伪装宇宙的所谓法则，并不适用于内在宇宙。它们甚至不适用于其他的伪装层面。然而，内在宇宙的法则却适用于所有的伪装宇宙，任何层面上的所有意识，都必须遵循内在宇宙的基本法则。这些基本法则中的一些法则，在不同的伪装层面上都有相对应的法则，被人们所知和接受。这些法则有各种表现形式，也有各种名称。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane resumed pacing again.)</td><td>(现在，珍再次恢复来回踱步。)</td></tr><tr><td>These basic laws are followed on many levels in your own universe.We will go into these laws in time.So far I have given you but one, which is value fulfillment.</td><td>在你们自己的宇宙中，这些基本法则在很多层次上都被遵循着。我们将适时讨论这些法则。到目前为止，我只给了你们一个，那就是，值的充盈(valuefulfillment)。</td></tr><tr><td>In your physical universe this rule is followed as physical growth.The entity follows this rule through the cycle of reincarnations.The species of mankind, and all other species in your universe on your particular horizontal plane, follow this law under the auspices of evolution.On other planes this law is carried through in other manners, but it is never ignored.</td><td>在你们的物质宇宙中，物质的增长遵循这个法则。存有通过循环转世遵循这个法则。人类这个物种，以及你们宇宙中所有其他物种，在你们这特定的水平层面上，都在演化的支持之下，遵循这个法则。在其他的层面上，这个法则是以其他方式贯彻的，它永远不会被忽略。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest because of the importance of the material that you take a break.</td><td>因为资料的重要性，我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was dissociated; indeed way out, as she put it.She looked over the above material during break because she wanted to know what she had been talking about.Resume at 10:35.)</td><td>(珍解离了，用她的话说，她出神出得很远。休息时，她看了看上面的资料，因为她想知道自己说的是什么内容。10:35继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>The second law of the inner universe is energy transformation.This occurs constantly.</td><td>内在宇宙的第二条法则是能量转换(energytransformation)。这在不断地发生着。</td></tr><tr><td>Energy transformation and value fulfillment, all existing within the spacious present, add up to a durability that is at the same time spontaneous.Energy transformation and value fulfillment add up to a durability that is simultaneous.</td><td>能量转换与值的充盈，都存在于广阔的现在，加起来就是一种同时自发的持久性。能量转换与值的充盈加起来就是一种同时的持久性。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here, Jane smiled.)</td><td>(这里，珍笑了。)</td></tr><tr><td>You may see what we are getting into here.Our third law is spontaneity, and despite all appearances of beginning and end, despite all appearances of death and decay, all consciousness exists in the spacious present, in a spontaneous manner, in simultaneous harmony, and yet within the spacious present there is also durability.</td><td>这里，你可能看出我们正要讨论什么了。我们内在宇宙的第三条法则是自发性(spontaneity)，尽管有开始和结束的所有表象，尽管有死亡与衰败的所有表象，所有的意识都以自发的方式存在于广阔的现在，存在于同时的和谐中，然而，在广阔的现在，也有持久性。</td></tr><tr><td>Durability is our fourth law.Durability within the framework of the spacious present would not exist were it not for the laws of value fulfillment and energy transformation.These make duration within the spacious present not only possible but necessary.</td><td>持久性(Durability)是我们内在宇宙的第四条法则。如果没有值的充盈和能量转换的法则，在广阔的现在架构内的持久性就不会存在。这两者使得在广阔的现在之内的持久性不仅可能，而且必要。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, on your particular camouflage universe you are learning energy transformation.And in your case you are learning to transform inner energy by forming it into physical constructions that the plane enables you to manipulate by the formation of particular outer senses for this purpose.You are severely limited as yet in the use of your abilities.When the two laws of value fulfillment and energy transformation are mastered, then duration is a natural consequence.</td><td>现在，在你们特定的伪装宇宙中，你们正在学习能量转换。就你们来说，你们正在学习通过将内在能量形成物质结构来转换它，这个层面使你能够通过形成特定的外在感官来操作这个目的。但到目前为止，你们在能力的使用上，还受到严重的限制。当掌握了值的充盈与能量转换这两条法则，那么，持续(duration)，就是一个自然的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>What you consider death has no more basic reality than has your idea of time and space.Death really represents a blind spot in your present ability to perceive energy transformation, and even value fulfillment.Death merely represents the termination of your own perception, that is, the termination of your understanding.Your ability here amounts to a complete dwindling of comprehension.Your senses are not equipped to perceive the transformation of energy from one form to another.</td><td>你们所认为的死亡，并不比你们对时间和空间的想法，更具有基本的实相。死亡，其实代表你现在感知能量转换的能力，甚至值的充盈能力的一个盲点。死)亡，仅仅是代表你自己感知的终止，也就是说，你理解的终止。你们这方面的能力，相当于理解力的完全萎缩。你们的感官，并不具备感知能量从一种性式到另一种形式的能力。</td></tr><tr><td>Certainly the birth of a child is really basically just as incomprehensible, but this transformation is projected into, rather than out of, your sphere of understanding.What you call death is merely the transformation of your own energy onto a sphere that cannot be perceived by the outer senses.I hope that I have made this material plain enough for your plane.</td><td>当然，一个孩子的出生确实从根本上是不可思议的，但这个转换，是一种投射进入(而不是离开)你们的理解领域。你们所谓的死亡，只不过是你们自己的能量转换到一个无法被外在感官感知的领域。我希望对你们的层面，我已经把这个资料讲得够清楚了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane leaned smiling over the desk.)</td><td>(珍微笑着靠在桌前。)</td></tr><tr><td>Actually, duration itself is dependent upon such transformation.We have managed together to do extremely well with this evenings session, and I dare say that I came through in excellent fashion.</td><td>实际上，持续本身，就取决于这样的转换。我们已经成功地共同完成了今晚的课，我敢说，我过来的方式极为出色。</td></tr><tr><td>I want to make one note here, that again experience in the use of psychological time will bring you close to an understanding of the value climate of psychological reality, for obvious reasons.Psychological time indeed is a part of this climate as it appears in fairly uncamouflaged form in your own universe.You can get the feel of it.</td><td>我想在这里说明一点，使用心理时间的经验，将会带领你们接近对心理实相值的气候(valueclimate)的理解，原因很明显。心理时间的确是这个心理实相值的气候的一部分，它以相当不加伪装的形式，出现在你)们自己的宇宙中。你们可以感觉得到它。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:00.Again Jane was fully dissociated.Her delivery was still very slow when she resumed at 11:05.)</td><td>(11:00休息。珍再次完全地解离。11:05恢复时，她的传讯还是很慢。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am not giving you these laws necessarily in the order of their importance, merely in the order which is easiest for me to

your physical universe this law is followed through idea constructions which become idea approximations of inner reality that are, nevertheless, distorted to a large degree, and make up the various camouflage patterns with which you are familiar.</td><td>在你们的物质宇宙里，这条法则是通过理念建构而被遵循的，这些理念构建成为了内在实相的近似物，然而，它们在很大程度上是被扭曲的，构成形形色色你们所熟悉的伪装模式。</td></tr><tr><td>We will go into these laws, and outline others in future sessions.You will see also how the inner senses are equipped to perceive basic inner realities of the inner universe, in much the same manner that your outer senses are equipped to manipulate within your camouflage universe.</td><td>我们将在今后的课程中，详细探讨这些法则，并且概略介绍一下其他的法则。你们也会看到，内在感官如何配备来感知内在宇宙的基本内在实相，和你们的外在感官配备来感知你们的伪装宇宙操纵的方式差不多。</td></tr><tr><td>This material is actually not nearly as difficult to understand as it may seem.Intuitively you should pick up much of it.The intuitions are not bound by the so-called laws of logic, and cause and effect.They do not take time as you know it into consideration, therefore they are not bound by continuity or limited to communication of words or even thoughts, strung out one after another.</td><td>这个资料，其实并不像它看起来的那么难理解。在直觉上，你们应该能理解大部分。直觉不受所谓的逻辑定律，以及因-果关系的束缚。它们并没有把你们知道的时间列入考虑，因此它们不受连续性的束缚，也不局限于一个接一个串起来的文字，甚至是思想的交流。</td></tr><tr><td>The intuitions are able to accept conceptual reality to some degree.They can feel the content and validity of a concept, where the brain itself may fall short.I am tempted to go into more laws this evening.However it is best that I withhold them until you grow more familiar with this evening’s material.</td><td>直觉能够接受概念的实相(conceptualreality)到某种程度。它们能够感觉到一个概念的内容和效力，而这是头脑本身所短缺的。我今晚很想探讨更多的法则。然而，我最好还是把它保留到，等你们更熟悉了今晚的资料以后再说。</td></tr><tr><td>Remember however our universe that fulfills itself yet takes up no space, and our imaginary painting in which distance appears ever further in the background, while never touching the back of the painting, and this may give you some intuitive understanding of our spacious present that has duration, and yet takes up no space.</td><td>不过，请记住，我们的宇宙，体现它自己，却不占用空间，还有我们那幅想像的画，在画中，距离在背景中似乎越来越远，却永远不会触及画的背面，这也许可以让你们对我们那广阔的现在有一些直观的理解，它有持久性却不占空间。</td></tr><tr><td>Contradictions, or rather apparent contradictions in terms will arise only out of a false conception on your part, mostly as a result of the erroneous cause- and effect system.Obviously cause and effect has only limited application even on your own plane and in your own camouflage universe.</td><td>矛盾，或相当明显的矛盾，只会出于你们的错误概念，多半是错误的因果体系造成的。显然，即使在你们自己的层面上和在你们自己的伪装宇宙中，因果的)应用也很有限。</td></tr><tr><td>If cause and effect were an absolute law, then continuity would also have to be an absolute law, and all or any evidences of clairvoyance, or viewing the future, would be absolutely impossible, even in your universe, and this simply is not so.It is only because there is basically no cause and effect, but merely apparent cause and effect, and no past, present and future, that clairvoyance is possible in your universe.</td><td>如果因果关系是一个绝对法则，那么连续性也必须是一个绝对的法则，所有或任何千里眼，或预见未来的证据，即使在你们的宇宙里，也都绝对不可能，但根本不是这样。只是因为基本上没有因果，只是表象上的因果，也没有过去、现在和未来，所以，千里眼在你们的宇宙中才有可能。</td></tr><tr><td>And while awareness of clairvoyance is fairly rare, it does exist; and though watered down in most instance, is a natural method of warning individuals of happenings with which their own outer senses would not be familiar.It is a natural method of protecting the individual by giving him an inner knowledge of events.Without constant clairvoyance on the part of every man and woman, existence on your plane would involve such inner, psychological insecurity that it would be completely unbearable.</td><td>虽然，千里眼的觉察相当罕见，但它确实存在；虽然在大多数情况下被淡化了，但它是一种自然的方法，可以警告个人，他们自己的外在感官不熟悉的事情。它是一种自然的方法，通过给予个人对事件的内在知识来保护他。要不是每个男人和女人一直都有千里眼，在你们层面上的存在，将会涉及这种内在的、心理上的不安全感，那将是完全无法承受的。</td></tr><tr><td>Individuals are always warned of disasters, so that the organism can prepare itself ahead of time.The day of death is known.Consciously such knowledge is not given to the ego for obvious reasons, but every organism, through its inner senses, is equipped with subconscious knowledge of personal disasters, deaths, and so forth, the personality itself deciding beforehand what it considers disastrous; and the members of the species as a whole know in advance of their wars.As telepathy operates constantly at a subconscious level, as a basis for all language and communication, so clairvoyance operates continually so that the physical organism can prepare itself to face its challenges.</td><td>个体总是被警告有灾难，这样机体就可以提前做好准备。死亡的日子是知道的。由于明显的原因，这样的知识在意识上是不会给自我的，但每个有机体，通过它的内在感官，都配备了关于个人灾难、死亡等的潜)意识知识，人格本身事先决定了它认为是灾难性的；整个物种的成员，都事先知道他们的战争。正如心灵感应在潜意识层次不断运作，作为所有语言和沟通的基础，同样的，千里眼也在持续不断地运作，以使身体有机体可以做好准备去面对挑战。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner senses also convey the knowledge that death is merely an energy transformation, and your almost numberless religions merely represent idea symbols that attempt to make this knowledge plain to the ego.That they deal with distortions and camouflage material is not to be wondered at. They have managed in some way to make this inner knowledge a part of the ego-understanding of the species.</td><td>内在的感官也传达了这样的知识，即死亡只是一种能量转换，而你们几乎数不胜数的宗教，只是代表了试图让自我了解这种知识的观念象征。它们处理的是扭曲和伪装的资料，这是不必怀疑的，它们以某种方式，设法让这份内在知识成为小我对物种的理解的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>This is quite enough for one session, my pigeons.</td><td>对于一节课来说，这样就够多了，我的鸽子们。</td></tr><tr><td>("Can I ask a question?")</td><td>("我能问个问题吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>You may.</td><td>可以。</td></tr><tr><td>("Can you tell us anything about Miss Callahan tonight?"</td><td>("今晚你能告诉我们一些关于卡拉汉小姐的事吗？"</td></tr><tr><td>(It will be remembered that in the 33rd session, page 262 [in Volume One], Seth suggested the date, April 15, 1964, as a significant one for Miss Callahan.By coincidence, this session fell on April 15, so naturally I was curious to learn more.Jane’s thought at the time of the 33rd session was that April 15th meant possibly a change for Miss Callahan, instead of her death necessarily.</td><td>(应该记得，在第33节课，赛斯暗示1964年4月15日，对于卡拉汉小姐有重大意义。巧的是，今天这节课就是4月15日，所以我自然很好奇，想了解更多信)息。珍在第33节课时想到的是，4月15日可能意味着卡拉汉小姐的一个变化，而不一定是她的死亡。</td></tr><tr><td>(I now also was curious to see if distortion cropped up, since Seth had dealt with this problem in the 36th session to some extent.Distortion where personal material is concerned is, Jane and I feel, a possibility still, until her abilities mature.)</td><td>(我现在也好奇，看看会不会出现扭曲，因为赛斯在第36节课，在一定程度上涉及过这个问题。珍和我都觉得，在她的能力成熟之前，个人资料的失真还是有可能的。)</td></tr><tr><td>Only that today, or rather this late evening, between this evening actually and two AM your time, she will undergo a severe crisis, and that rapid deterioration of brain tissue will set in.She is over, or will be over, the worst hump by then, and even the ego will be forced to acquiesce.</td><td>今天，或者说是今天傍晚，在今天傍晚实际到你们时间凌晨两点之间，她将经历一场严重的危机，脑组织将开始快速恶化。那时候，她会度过，或将度过最严重的坎，甚至自我也会被迫默许。</td></tr><tr><td>The last struggles of the ego will take place in these hours.It will finally understand that it is not to be dumped aside but taken along as itself, independent as always, to stand beside other independent egos that all represent facets of the entity.</td><td>在这几个小时，自我将会作最后的挣扎。自我最终将会明白，它不是要被甩在一旁，而是作为它自己，一如既往地独立，与其他独立的自我站在一起，这些自我都代表着存有的各个面向。</td></tr><tr><td>No powers are taken away from the ego.It has what abilities it has achieved, plus the ability to draw upon other energy which it could not draw upon.That is all I will say now along those lines.</td><td>没有任何力量从自我中被剥夺。自我有它所成就的能力，外加汲取它过去无法汲取的其他能量的那份能力。在这方面，目前我要说的就这些。</td></tr><tr><td>The session has been an excellent one.Even old Doubting Thomas Ruburt is impressed enough with the material to admit that his precious subconscious simply could not be the source of it all.</td><td>这节课非常棒。就连老疑神疑鬼的托马斯-鲁伯也对这些资料印象深刻，承认自己宝贵的潜意识根本不可能是这一切的来源。</td></tr><tr><td>I bid you a most fond good evening, and as usual look forward to our next meeting.I would not be surprised if your friend Philip attended.Ta ta, tootsies.</td><td>我祝你们有个非常美好的夜晚，也会一如既往地期待我们的下一节课。如果你们的朋友菲利普来上课的话，我不会感到意外。拜拜。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth.See you Monday.

what could not be seen or touched.But contrariwise he doubted, always probed and then often doubted quite legitimate results, as indeed he sometimes continues to do so.</td><td>鲁柏在许多方面，比我们任何一个人都更容易接受看不见或摸不着的东西。但与此相反的是，他怀疑、总是探究，然后经常对非常合理的结果质疑，事实上，他有时继续这样做。</td></tr><tr><td>You are both, with my invaluable help, coming along very well.Your attitudes toward the outside world have certainly improved.Ten minutes of your clock time a day would certainly be of great value in the use of psychological time, and I suggest that you try this.</td><td>在我无可估量的帮助下，你们俩都进展的非常好。你们对于外在世界的态度的确有所改善。每天抽出十分钟的钟表时间来利用心理时间，肯定会很有价值，我建议你们试一试。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane began to slow up in her dictation, as she has in recent sessions.Once again her manner became quite slow and deliberate.)</td><td>(像最近的课一样，现在珍的传述有点慢。再一次，她的方式变得相当缓慢且慎重。)</td></tr><tr><td>The value climate of psychological reality can be likened to an ocean in which all consciousness has its being.There are multitudinous levels that can be plunged into with various life forms, diverse and alien, but nevertheless interconnected and dependent one upon the other.I like the ocean analogy because you get the idea of continuous flow and motion without apparent division.</td><td>心理实相之值的气候氛围可以比喻为海洋，在这个海洋里，所有的意识都有它的存在。有无数的层次可以跳入，生命形式各有不同，多元又相异，但彼此相互连结、相互依存。我喜欢这个海洋的比喻，因为你可以得到没有明显分割的连续流动和运动的概念。</td></tr><tr><td>As temperatures in various depths of ocean change, and as even the color of the water and of the flora and fauna change, so too in our value climate there are quality changes, and senses equipped to project and perceive the changes.There are distortions because of the limitations of the outer senses, but the inner senses do not distort.The inner senses inhabit directly the atmosphere of our value climate; and they see through the ever varying camouflage patterns, and the flux and flow of apparent change.In our sessions to some small degree you plunge into this ocean of value climate, and to the extent that you are able to divest yourselves of the clothes of camouflage, to that extent can you truly be aware of this climate.</td><td>就像海洋的温度随着深度的不同而改变，甚至就像水的颜色和动植物群的颜色变化一样，在我们值的气候氛围里，也有质的变化，也有配备的感官，来投射和感知这些变化。由于外在感官的限制性，会有扭曲，但内在感官不会扭曲。内在感官直接住在我们值的气候氛围中；它们看穿不断变化的伪装模式，看穿表面变化的流变。在我们的课里，你有小小的程度，也跳入这个值的气候氛围的海洋中，而且某种程度，能够剥去自己的伪装外衣，到那个程度，你们就能真正意识到这个心理实相的气候。</td></tr><tr><td>What is required is more than a divesting of clothes however.To plunge into this ocean you also leave the physical body at the shore.It will be there when you get back.Your camouflage patterns can be likened to the patterns cast by sun and shadow upon the evermoving waves.As long as you keep the pattern in mind, you create it, and it is there.If you turn your head away for a moment and then look quickly back you can see only the wave.Your camouflage and your world is created by conscious focusing and unconscious concentration.Only by turning your head away for a moment can you see what is beneath the seemingly solid pattern.By plunging into our ocean of value climate you can dive beneath your camouflage system and look up to see it, relatively foundationless, floating above you, moved, formed and directed by the shifting illusions caused by the wind of will, and the force of subconscious concentration and demand.</td><td>然而单单剥去伪装外衣是不够的。要跳入这个海洋，你还要把肉身留在岸边。当你回来的时候，它还会在那里。你的伪装模式可以比作阳光和阴影投射在起伏不已的波浪上的图案。只要你记住这个图案，你就能创造它，而它就在那里。如果你把头转开一下，然后快速回头一瞥，你就只能看到波浪。你们的伪装和你们的世界是被有意识的聚焦和无意识的专注创造出来的。只有把头转开片刻，你们才能看到看似坚固的模式下面是什么。借由跳入我们值的气候海洋中，你们才能潜入你们的伪装系统之下，擡头看它，相对来说它没有基础，漂浮在你们的上方，被意志之风、潜意识专注和需求的力量所造成的变化幻象所移动、形成和引导。</td></tr><tr><td>Yet even these camouflage patterns must follow the basic rules of the inner universe, and reflect them even if in a distortive manner.So does value expansion become reincarnation and evolution and growth.So are all the other basic laws of the inner universe followed on every plane, and reflected from the most minute to the most gigantic spectrum.</td><td>但甚至是这些伪装模式，也必须遵循内在宇宙的基本法则，并反映它们，即使是以一种扭曲的方式。所以值的扩展就变成转世、演化与成长；内在宇宙的其他所有基本法则也是如此，在每一个层面上都要遵循，并从最微小到最巨大的光谱中反映出来。</td></tr><tr><td>Concentrating upon your own camouflage universe, you are able to distinguish only the distortive pattern, and from this pattern you deduce your ideas of cause and effect, past, present and future, and ideas of an expanding universe that bloats.Consciousness takes up no space nor is it enclosed by time, as you know time.The camouflage patterns that seem to enclose consciousness are temporary, for short term only, and for limited but necessary purpose.</td><td>专注于自己的伪装宇宙，你们只能够分辨出扭曲的模式，从这个模式中你们推导出你的因果、过去、现在和未来的想法，以及膨胀的宇宙的想法。意识不占空间，也不被你们知道的时间围住。那些看似围住意识的伪装模式是暂时的，为时短暂，目的有限但必要。</td></tr><tr><td>Any investigation of the basic inner universe, which is the only real universe, must be done as much as possible from a point outside your own distortions, but the only way open for you to escape the distortions of your own physical universe is to journey inward.To get outside your own universe, you must travel inward, and this represents the only perspective free of distortive elements, from which valid experimentation can be carried on.Your so-called scientific, so-called objective experiments can continue for an eternity, but they only probe further and further with camouflage instruments into a camouflage universe.</td><td>任何对基本的内在宇宙，也就是唯一真实的宇宙的调查，都必须尽可能地从你们自己的扭曲之外的一个点来着手，但摆脱你们自己的物质宇宙的扭曲的唯一途径是向内旅行。要到达你们自己的宇宙外面，你们必须向内旅行，这代表着唯一没有扭曲因素的角度，从这个角度可以进行有效的实验。你们所谓的科学，所谓的客观实验可以持续到永远，但它们只是用伪装的仪器在一个伪装的宇宙中越探越远。</td></tr><tr><td>The subconscious, it is true, has elements of its own distortions, but these are easier to escape than the tons of distortive camouflage atmosphere that weigh your scientific experiments down.</td><td>潜意识，确实有其自身扭曲的因素，但这些比起成吨的扭曲伪装氛围，更容易逃脱，因为这些伪装氛围会拖累你们的科学实验。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:32.Jane was dissociated as usual.By the time break arrived she was speaking in a rather normal voice.Resume at 9:35.)</td><td>(9:32休息。珍解离如常。到休息时间为止，她一直以正常的语调说话。9:35继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>You cannot have so-called objective experiments when you are surrounded by, and dealing with, and intertwined with, the elements of the camouflage universe.You are, or scientists are, working within what may be described as one small cube within literally millions of somewhat similar though different cubes, the cubes all representing various camouflage universes.</td><td>当你们被伪装宇宙的成分所包围，与之打交道、并与它们纠缠不清时，你们不可能进行所谓的客观实验。你们，或者说科学家们，是在可以被描述为千千万万个有些相似，但不同的方块中的一个小方块中工作，这些方块都代表着各种伪装宇宙。</td></tr><tr><td>If they were ever lucky enough to pierce through their own cube, which is doubtful, they would merely discover the cube nearest to them, without ever imagining that there were literally numberless such cubes.A small portion of the spacious present appears in your cube but you see it in camouflage terms of continuity, in camouflage waves of past, present and future.</td><td>如果他们够幸运，能穿透自己的方块，我怀疑他们做得到，他们只会发现离自己最近的方块，而绝不会想到有无数这样的方块。广阔的现在的一小部分，出现在你们的方块中，但你们看到的它却是伪装的持续，是过去、现在和未来的伪装波浪。</td></tr><tr><td>Like rats in mazes, with luck you could theoretically travel from one cube or maze to another, though practically this is impossible.But even if your experiments gave you knowledge of many of these camouflage cube universes, you would learn little of the basic uncamouflaged inner universe, where all such divisions disappear.</td><td>就像迷宫里的老鼠，运气好的话，在理论上，你们可以从一个迷宫或方块旅行到另一个，虽然实际上这是不可能的。但是，即便你们的实验，给你们很多这些伪装方块宇宙的知识，你们也不会学到什么基本的无伪装的内在宇宙，在那里，所有这样的划分都消失了。</td></tr><tr><td>Any scientific personage of your generation will immediately panic at such suggestions as I am making.You are so taken up with your precious camouflage patterns, and so unfamiliar with the inner propulsion behind all such materializations, that it will be a while before any headway is made.</td><td>你们这一代的任何科学界人士，要是听到我正在给的建议，会立即恐慌起来。你们花了那么多时间精力在你们宝贵的伪装模式上，对所有这种物质化背后的内在动力却是如此陌生，所以要想取得任何进展，还需要一段时间。</td></tr><tr><td>Einstein traveled within, and trusted, his own intuitions, and used his inner senses.He would have discovered much more had he been able to trust his intuitions even more, and able to leave more of the so-called scientific proof of his theories to lesser men, to give himself more inner freedom.</td><td>爱因斯坦游走于内心，相信自己的直觉，他也运用他的内在感官。如果当初他能够更加信任自己的直觉，把证明他理论的更多所谓的科学证据，留给更少的人，给自己更多的内心自由，那他的发现会更多。</td></tr><tr><td>There is only a relatively small layer of personal material, and therefore egotistical and distortive material, at the upper reaches of the subconscious.This layer can be quickly recognized, as a rule.Ruburt recognizes it now, and he is no scientist or psychologist.For the record, you understand that I am referring to egotistical material as that portion that is concerned with the outer camouflage- oriented personality, and that the stronger inner ego actually represents the power and ability behind the outer ego.</td><td>在潜意识的上层区域，只有相对来说一小层的个人资料，因此是自我本位和扭曲的资料。一般来说，这一层很快就能被认出来。鲁柏现在就可以把它认出来，而他既不是科学家，也不是心理学家。声明一下，你了解我说的自我本位资料，指的是和外在伪装导向的)人格有关的部分，而更强大的内在自我，实际上代表外在自我背后的力量与能力。</td></tr><tr><td>Now.Directly, so to speak, beneath this personal material in the subconscious, is racial material which could be of great value to psychologists in their study of racial histories, and resulting psychological differences of the various races.Underneath this is material dealing with the species as a whole, with its background, evolution and inner knowledge.</td><td>现在。可以说，在潜意识中的这些个人资料之下，是种族资料，这资料对心理学家研究种族历史，及由此产生的不同种族的心理差异可能很有价值。在这下面，是涉及整个物种的资料，有其背景、演化和内在知识。</td></tr><tr><td>Beneath this, pure and simple, undistorted, there for the searching, absolutely free for the asking, is the knowledge inherent in the inner self pertaining to the inner universe as a whole, its laws and principles, its composition.Here you will find, undistorted, uncamouflaged, the innate knowledge of the creation of the camouflage universe, the mechanics involved, much of the material that I have given you, the method and ways by which the inner self as a basic inhabitant of the inner universe, existing in the climate of psychological reality, helps create the various planes of existence, constructs outer senses to project and perceive the various apparent realities or camouflages, how the inner self reincarnates on the various planes.Here you will find your answers as to how the inner self transforms energy for his own purposes, changes his form, adopts other apparent realities, and all this free for the investigation.</td><td>在这之下，纯粹又简单，没有扭曲、任人搜寻、有求必应的，是内在自己天生具有的知识，关于整个内在宇宙，包含它的法则和原则、它的组成。在这里，我们将会发现与生具来的知识，没有扭曲也没有伪装，关于伪装宇宙的创造，其中涉及的机制，这方面资料我已经给了你们很多，还有内在自己作为内在宇宙的一个基本居民采行的方法和途径，存在心理实相的气候之中，这份资料帮忙创造各个不同的存在层面，建构外在感官来投射和感知形形色色外显的实相或伪装，还有内在自己如何在各个层面上转世轮回。在这里，你们将会找到你们的答案，明白内在自己如何为了自己的目的转换能量、改变形式、采纳其他外显的)实相，而且这一切任人自由探究。</td></tr><tr><td>Hypnotism will become more and more a tool of scientific investigation.Telepathy will be proven without a doubt, and utilized, sadly enough in the beginning, for purposes of war and intrigue.Nevertheless telepathy will enable your race to make its first contact with alien intelligence.It will not at first be recognized as such.</td><td>催眠将越来越成为科学调查的一个工具。心灵感应将会被证实确有其事，并且被加以利用，但非常可悲的是，它一开始是为了达到战争和阴谋的目的。即便如此，心灵感应将使你们的种族，有能力与外星智慧)(alienintelligence)进行第一次接触。一开始你们不会认出是外星人。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here, Jane laughed as she paced back and forth.)</td><td>(这时，珍笑了，她来回踱步。)</td></tr><tr><td>There is nothing any more strange in such contact than there is in my contact with you.But because you are so involved with camouflage apparent reality, contact with such intelligence will be a startling discovery.The contact made will be from one male to another, although the alien male, from another camouflage galaxy, will be more involved than you consider possible.</td><td>这种接触并不会比我和你们的接触更奇怪。但是由于你们是如此参与伪装的表面现实，所以与那种智能的接触，才会显得是一个惊人的发现。所做的接触将是从一个男性到另一个男性的接触，但是，这个来自另一个伪装星系的外星男性，涉入的程度，将会比你们可能认为的还要深。</td></tr><tr><td>The actual telepathy contact with this alien intelligence will occur, your time I believe, not too far distant, perhaps by the year 2001.However, for reasons that I will not go into, a hitch will develop of which your scientists will not be aware, at least in your terms.The intelligence that you contact will no longer inhabit that same universe by the time that the contact is made.</td><td>与这个外星智慧的实际心灵感应接触将会发生，我相信在你们的时代，不会太远，可能是2001年。然而，由于我不想细说的原因，会出现一个你们的科学家不会意识到的小插曲，至少在你们看来是这样。你们所)接触的智能体，到了双方接触的时候，将不再居住在同一个宇宙。</td></tr><tr><td>By then you will have discovered that your present theory of the expanding universe is in error; and this error will, nevertheless, affect your calculations as to the exact location in your space, of the intelligence that is contacted.The contact will be made, I believe, in Australia.</td><td>到那时，你们将会发现，你们现有的宇宙膨胀理论是错误的；并且，这个错误，还会影响你们计算接触这个外星智能在你们空间的准确位置。我相信，这个接触将发生在澳大利亚。</td></tr><tr><td>Space travel, in your terms, will develop in a seemingly extravagant and startling fashion, only to be dumped as such when your scientists discover that space as you know it is a distortion, and that journeying from one so-called galaxy to another is done by divesting the physical body from camouflage.The vehicle of so-called space travel is mental and psychic mobility, in terms of psychic transformation of energy, enabling spontaneous and instantaneous mobility through the spacious present.</td><td>你们说的太空旅行，将会以一种看似夸张和惊人的方式发展，只是当你们的科学家发现，你们所知道的空间是扭曲的，并且发现，所谓的从一个星系到另一个星系的旅行，是要卸下肉身的伪装才能做到的时候，它就会被丢弃。所谓太空旅行的载具是精神和灵性的移动(mobility)，就灵性的能量转换而言，能够在广阔的现在，自发和瞬间的移动。</td></tr><tr><td>As to the means, the very simplest and crudest but still to be adopted method will prove to be hypnotism, simply because at this point your personalities will not trust their own abilities but must rely upon suggestion from the outside.</td><td>至于手段，最简单、最粗略，但仍然会被采用的方法，将被证明是催眠，只因为此时，你们的人格不会信任自己的能力，而必须依靠外界的暗示。</td></tr><tr><td>I hope to try with you methods of energy transference divorced from or divested from hypnotism as such.This will be one of our experiments together and will not be too far in the future.When the time comes we three will try together.In the meantime preparation includes a systematic and scheduled use of psychological time.</td><td>我希望和你们一起尝试完全不用催眠的能量转换方法。这将会是我们共同的实验之一，而且是在不远的将来。到时候我们三个一起试。同时准备工作包括有系统、有计划地运用心理时间。</td></tr><tr><td>Hypnotism will be used scientifically simply as a means of breaking down the inhibitions of the outer personality.It goes without saying that such inhibitions are necessary on your plane, and any experiments that we try will be carried on in a most disciplined fashion.</td><td>催眠将会在科学上，单纯地被当作打破外在人格种种抑制的手段。不言而喻，这些抑制在你们层面上是必要的，我们所做的任何实验，都将以最严谨的方式进行。</td></tr><tr><td>I will never either suggest or condone a wholesale letting go of outer personality defenses.I am attempting to build up your outer personalities in their dealings with the outside world, while at the same time teaching the inner self spontaneity and freedom.This is quite a project.</td><td>我永远不会建议或纵容全盘抛掉外在人格的防御。我正在试图健全你们的外在人格，增强它们处理外在世界的能力，同时，教导内在自己的自发和自由。这是个相当大的工程。</td></tr><tr><td>The outer personality must be a strong yet resilient framework, able to dispense with its boundaries and allow the inner self its freedom, and yet strong enough to spring back and maintain its control over outward experience.This is certainly a discipline.</td><td>外在人格必须是一个强大而又有弹性的架构，能够放掉它的界限，给内在自己自由，但又有足够的力量回弹，并保持对外在经验的控制。这当然是一种锻练。</td></tr><tr><td>I am tempted to continue without allowing you a break.Ruburt is doing well without one, but I am concerned with your fingers.Are they faltering?If so, then by all means take a break.</td><td>我很想继续下去，不让你休息。鲁柏不休息也做得很好，但我很担心你的手指。它们在颤抖吗？如果是，那就休息一下吧。</td></tr><tr><td>("Okay.")</td><td>("好的"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Do you want a break?</td><td>你想休息一下吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes."</td><td>("是"。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:23.I was of course aware that regular break time had passed some while ago.For one thing, my right hand was quite cramped.Indeed it was almost painful, and I would have been forced to call a halt soon in any case.I also believe that while taking down part of the above material I was in something of a light trance state; sometime after our regular break period had passed, I seemed to become aware that I had been writing steadily without any awareness, or very little, of the material I was taking down.</td><td>(10:23休息。我当然知道，正常的休息时间已经过去好一会了。一来，我的右手抽筋得厉害。事实上，几乎是痛的，反正不用多久，我也不得不喊停。我也相信，在记下上面部分资料时，我处于某种轻微的恍惚状态；大约就在过了我们固定的休息时间之后，我似乎意识到，我一直在稳定地记录着，没有意识到或很少意识到我正在记下的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was fully dissociated.She said she thought Seth kept her going until he had gotten all of the above material through.Usually she does not reach full dissociation until the second break.</td><td>(珍完全解离。她说，她觉得赛斯会让她继续下去，直到他把上述所有资料说完。通常情况下，她一直要到第二次休息时，才会达到完全解离。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane experienced also her now familiar fat hands.She did not become aware of this until a minute or two after break began.Her hands were very moist, and appeared to be thickened, especially both index fingers.We talked of making arrangements to measure the circumference of her fingers before and during this phenomena, to see if there is actually any physical enlargement.</td><td>(珍也经历了她现在熟悉的胖手。直到休息开始一两分钟后，她才意识到这一点。她的手很潮湿，似乎变粗了，尤其是两个食指。我们谈到要作一下安排，在这个现象之前或之间来测量她手指的周长，看看它们有没有实质地变大。</td></tr><tr><td>(However, Jane could not get her wedding ring off at all, no matter how hard she tried.She had removed the other ring she usually wears before the session.It fits loosely as a rule, but now she had to force it back on her fourth finger; contrariwise, she then had to wet it to remove it.</td><td>(不过，无论珍如何努力，都无法将她的婚戒取下。她在上课前已经取下了另一枚戒指。在一般情况下，这枚戒指戴起来很松，但现在，她不得不用力才能把它戴回到无名指；反之亦然，她必须把它弄湿才能取下它。</td></tr><tr><td>(During the day Jane called the hospital to try to verify the information Seth had given us on the condition of Miss Callahan.See the 44th session, page 17.She learned instead that a week or so previously Miss Callahan’s relatives had moved her to a rest home.The hospital did not know which rest home.To me this implied that Miss Callahan was in better condition, but Jane said she felt otherwise, that Seth’s material here was not distorted.</td><td>(白天时，珍给医院打过电话，试图核实赛斯给我们提供的关于卡拉汉小姐病情的信息。见第44节课。通过电话她却得知，一个多星期前，卡拉汉小姐的亲戚将她转移到了一家疗养院。医院并不知道是哪间疗养院。对我来说，这意味着卡拉汉小姐的情况比较好，但珍说她不这么认为，赛斯的资料在这里没有被歪曲。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed dictation, after a longer break than usual, in a normal voice at 10:38.)</td><td>(在比平时更长的休息之后，珍以正常的声音继续传述，10:38。)</td></tr><tr><td>Hypnotism is important merely as a tool to release the conscious personality from the camouflage inhibitions.It then allows knowledge to rise up.In ordinary circumstances the conscious self deals mainly with camouflage existence.This is after all primarily its purpose.</td><td>催眠术的重要意义只是作为一种工具，将意识人格从伪装抑制中释放出来。在那之后，知识才得以升起。在一般情况下，有意识的自己主要是在处理伪装的存在。毕竟这是它的首要目的。</td></tr><tr><td>However, when it is enabled to let go its preoccupation with the camouflage universe, it can receive and be aware of data received by the inner senses.Such data does not have to be retained on a subconscious level.The conscious personality can be trained to receive, interpret and retain such knowledge.Otherwise such knowledge would be relatively without value in your camouflage universe.</td><td>不过，当它能够放下对伪装宇宙的专注时，它就能接收并意识到内在感官所接收的资料。这样的资料不一定要被保留在潜意识层。有意识的人格可以被训练去接受、转译和保留这样的知识。否则，这样的知识在你们的伪装宇宙，相对来说就没有价值。</td></tr><tr><td>Hypnotism then is one tool to enable the conscious personality to divest itself of its concentrated focus upon outer camouflage, and to enable it to focus instead upon the inner self.The main rule here is merely a change of focus.Knowledge of the basic universe can be achieved, interpreted and retained by your scientists in ways that I will at first outline, and then cover more completely.</td><td>所以，催眠就是一种工具，它可以使有意识的人格摆脱对外在伪装的集中关注，转而聚焦在内在自己。这里的主要规则就是改变焦点。基本宇宙的知识可以被你们的科学家取得、转译和保有，至于方法，我将首先概述这些方法，然后再更全面地介绍。</td></tr><tr><td>Hypnotism is a safer method to begin with than drugs, but hypnotism itself is not necessary if there is an inner willingness to explore the inner universe.The main barrier is the ego’s fear of being subjugated, even as it fears subjugation imagined in death.If the ego can be made to understand that inner awareness, exploration and investigation will actually enlarge its scope of awareness there will be little difficulty.</td><td>催眠是一种比药物更安全的方法，但是，如果有个内在意愿，想去探索内在宇宙的话，催眠本身就不必要了。主要的障碍是自我对被征服的恐惧，甚至就像，在想象中的死亡中，被征服一样。如果能让自我了解，内在的觉察、探索和调查，实际上会扩大它的觉察范围，就不会有什么困难了。</td></tr><tr><td>It may be necessary in the beginning to induce more or less complete amnesia, but this should be avoided.Through constant practice with hypnotism your scientists will discover that it is possible, and definitely beneficial, to allow the conscious ego to retain its memory.Since there is no real division between the ego and the subconscious, the knowledge of the ego and the knowledge of the subconscious are merged in any case.But to be truly effective there should be no attempt to hide subconscious knowledge from the ego.</td><td>在开始时，可能有必要诱发或多或少的完全失忆，但应该避免这样做。通过对催眠的不断练习，你们的科学家们会发现，让有意识的自我保留它的记忆是可能的，而且绝对是有益的。由于在自我和潜意识之间并没有真正的分隔，所以自我的知识和潜意识的知识，在任何情况下都是融合的。但要达到真正的效果，就不应该企图隐藏潜意识的知识，不让自我知道。</td></tr><tr><td>I realize that hypnotism will be utilized first.Nevertheless progress could be quickened if persons who did not need hypnotism to divest themselves of outer focus were used in scientific experiments.</td><td>我明白催眠将会先被利用。然而在科学实验里，如果选用不需要利用催眠就可以摆脱外在焦点的人，进度就可以加快。</td></tr><tr><td>With practice the personal distortive layers of subconscious material could be recognized without difficulty, and even these will give you valuable insights into psychological mechanisms.</td><td>经由练习，就可以不难识别个人的潜意识资料的扭曲层，甚至，这些还会让你们对心理机制有珍贵的深入了解。</td></tr><tr><td>Telepathy involves of course a focusing of abilities and energy.The trouble is that when you are dealing with, say, the transmission of a picture, you are still dealing with camouflage.You will do better when you focus inwardly in a receptive manner, but without any inhibiting factor.That is when you are willing to receive whatever comes.Focusing upon a camouflage objective will give you a camouflage result.</td><td>心灵感应当然涉及到能力和能量的聚焦。麻烦的是，当你面对的是，比如说，图片的传输，你面对的还是伪装。当你以一种接受性的方式向内聚焦，但没有任何抑制因素时，你们会做得更好。那就是不管传来什么，你们都愿意接收。聚焦在伪装的目标，得到的也会是伪装的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>You must be more open and receptive than this in order to receive knowledge of undistorted basic realities.And the truly hilarious part of this is that such seemingly subjective data will enable you to cut through objective, or so-called objective, reality in a way that will give you so-called proofs, that you can achieve in no other fashion.</td><td>你必须要比这更开放、更乐意接受，才能接收到没有扭曲的基本实相的知识。而真正搞笑的是，这种看似主观的资料，却能让你们能够以一种方式切入客观，或所谓的客观实相，给你带来所谓的证明，而这是你们无法用其他方式实现的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's delivery had been becoming more spirited.She was now talking somewhat faster, using many gestures, and pacing more rapidly.Now she rapped upon my desk for emphasis.)</td><td>(珍的传讯越来越有精神。她现在说话的速度快了些，有许多手势，步伐更快。现在，她敲着我的桌子以示强调。)</td></tr><tr><td>Using Ruburt's phrase, this may sound "far out," (in quotes), but even by the year 2000 it will all sound quite reasonable, and long before that your scientists will come to conclusions much like these.It is simply much easier, and even more scientific, to achieve a so-called, again, objective view of your universe by going inward, than it is to attempt to escape your distortive atmosphere by going further outward, because in the outward direction you will only meet more camouflage.</td><td>用鲁柏的话说，这听起来可能"很遥远"(加引号)，但即使到了公元2000年，这一切就会听起来非常合理，而且早在那时间到来之前，你们的科学家就会得出类似这样的结论。通过向内走，来实现对你们的宇宙产生一个所谓的客观观点，比起试图通过进一步向外走，来逃避你们的扭曲气氛，要容易得多，甚至更科学，因为在向外走的过程中，你只会遇到更多的伪装。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again a rap upon the desk.)</td><td>(又是一拍桌子。)</td></tr><tr><td>If scientists think that the inner world is a murky maze of intimate chaos, let them see what happens when they attempt space travel; that is, journeys through a camouflage nonexistent space to begin with, with a camouflage vehicle.They will get no further to the heart of truth or reality than a fly buzzing around the outside, forever closed to him, portion of a round, hard, unripe apple.</td><td>如果科学家认为内在世界是私密混乱的阴暗迷宫，那就让他们看看，当他们试图进行太空旅行时会发生什么；也就是说，用一个伪装的载具，穿越一个伪装的不存在的空间。他们不会比一只在苹果外面嗡嗡地飞来飞去的苍蝇，更接近真相或实相的核心，一个圆圆的、硬硬的、未成熟的苹果的部分，对苍蝇来说永远是封闭的。</td></tr><tr><td>There are definite experiments that can be tried in scientific laboratories that will enable your scientists to glimpse the inner reality, and to actually discover the ways and means by which the inner energy-self transforms the energy of itself into physical patterns.There are laws which govern the birth and death, not only of men but of all conscious beings, and these laws can be discovered for the asking.</td><td>是有一些明确的实验，可以在科学实验室中尝试，你们的科学家能够借此一窥内在实相，并实际发现内在的能量自己(energy-self)，将自身的能量转换为物质模式的途径和方法。有统辖生与死的法则，不仅是人的生与死，而且是所有有意识的存在(allconsciousbeings)之生与死，这些法则只要你想要，就可以被发现。</td></tr><tr><td>I regretfully believe that a break is in order, but we are all in fine form tonight.</td><td>很可惜，我认为应该休息一下，但我们今晚的状态都很好。</td></tr><tr><td>(This time Jane really pounded upon my desk, smiling as she did so.I replied that I was glad we were all in fine form; and instead of breaking, Jane once more pounded the table, then continued in a most vehement and pleased manner.Her eyes were very dark, her voice strong.)</td><td>(这一次，珍着实用力地拍着我的桌子，还一边笑着。我回答说，我很高兴我们的状态都很好；而珍不但没有休息，反而再次拍打着桌子，然后又非常热切愉快地继续。她的眼睛很黑，声音有力。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will give you some material before I am through.The experiments will only have to be tried and their validity will speak for itself.If I can get Ruburt over his sometimes cussed hardheadedness, his belligerent egotistical blunderings, then he can perform feats that will more than show the validity of my statements.To think that I am to some admittedly large extent dependent upon his development!(exclamation point).</td><td>在结束之前，我会给你们一些资料。实验只要试一试，它们的效力就不言自明了。如果我可以让鲁柏那有时冥顽不灵、自我本位、好斗又浮躁的脑袋想通的话，那么他就能完成一些壮举，这将更能展现，我的声明的有效性。想想看，不可否认地，我在很大程度上可是依赖他的进展呢！(惊叹号)</td></tr><tr><td>You could do much better too.Relax, let go.You are like a donkey too, but I will pull your tail.Soon I will have you at the point where your fingers will feel no fatigue, and then I will make up for lost time.</td><td>你也可以做得更好。放松，放手。你也像一头驴子，不过我会拉住你的尾巴。很快我就会让你的手指感觉不到疲劳，然后我会把失去的时间补回来。</td></tr><tr><td>My apologies, I forgot your break again.And incidentally: Ruburt’s hard- headedness and egotistical dragging of feet so far, hampers me in a beautiful little demonstration.I see the office of your precious Psychic Society, and your director, but Ruburt fears to make a mistake, and he blocks me.</td><td>对不起，我又忘了你们的休息时间。顺便说一句：鲁柏固执的脑袋和自我本位的拖延，妨碍了我的一次漂亮的小表演。我看到你们那个尊贵的心灵协会办公)室，还有你们的会长，但鲁柏怕出错，所以他挡住了我。</td></tr><tr><td>Take your break.</td><td>你们休息一下吧。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:15.Jane ended the monologue with another blow upon the desk.She was fully dissociated— way out, she said.She felt Seth was ready to talk about the American Society for Psychic Research; but she was so afraid of making a mistake that she couldn't let the material come through yet.</td><td>(11:15休息。珍在桌子上又打了一拳，结束了这次独白。她说，她彻底解离出去了。她感觉赛斯准备谈美国心灵研究协会。但她很害怕出错，所以她还无法让资料透过来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth, she said, could go on for hours.The break was only for my benefit, to rest my hand.Where it had bothered me earlier, I now felt no discomfort however.When Jane began dictating again she immediately took up with her very energetic and forceful manner.Resume at 11:17.)</td><td>(她说，赛斯，可以继续上好几个小时。休息仅仅是为了我，为了让我的手歇会儿。之前我的手很不舒服，现在却没有任何不适的感觉。她立刻以她那非常有活力和有力的方式开始了。11:17恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>For Ruburt's edification, this hardheaded egotistical belligerence is somewhat of a good thing, in that without it our sessions, theoretically and perhaps practically, could result in undisciplined and even to some extent dangerous exhibitions of shilly-shallyings, without adequate controls.</td><td>为了鲁柏的启发，这种顽固自负的好斗性，从某方面来说是件好事，因为如果没有它，我们的课在理论上，又或许在实践上，可能会缺乏适当的控制，显得没有纪律、甚至某程度上危险的碎碎念的呈现。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt possesses two necessary qualities which luckily do not blot each other out, though they could.He is extremely receptive, open to and even appreciative of inner data, and also possesses an ego strong enough to maintain necessary discipline.This makes it easier and also more difficult for me, but goes a long ways toward minimizing any psychological dangers on your part, and what is gained is solid.There will be no backtracking, and while achievements along some lines may be slower they can be counted upon.</td><td>鲁柏拥有两个必要的品质，二者可以互相遮蔽，所幸没有。他极易接受、开放甚至欣赏内在资讯，也拥有足够强大的自我，来维持必要的纪律。这让我变得更容易，也更困难，但却能在很大程度上，将你们的任何心理危险降到最低，这收获是扎实的。不会有倒退，虽然在某些方面的成就可能会慢一些，但也是指日可待的。</td></tr><tr><td>Without your confidence and intuitive affirmation, much of this material would be blocked on Ruburt’s part, Joseph, and Ruburt depends strongly upon inner strengths that you possess, and of which you are mainly ignorant.We

plain.</td><td>约瑟，如果没有你的信心和直觉的肯定，这些资料中的很多内容，在鲁柏那边就会被挡住了，鲁柏强烈地依赖你不知道自己所拥有的内在力量。过一阵子，我们会探讨与我们的完形(gestalt)有关的机制，到时候我们再把整个事情说清楚。</td></tr><tr><td>I am trying to develop Ruburt’s abilities so that he does not use his own nervous energy in these sessions because, oh, he would squawk if he was tired and did not get his own writing time in.</td><td>我是想培养鲁伯的能力，让他不用在这些课程中使用自己紧张的精力，因为，噢，如果他累了，又没有安排他自己的写作时间，他会叫嚣抗议。</td></tr><tr><td>(To make this point, Jane waved her arms in a comical display of anguish.)</td><td>(为了强调这一点，珍滑稽地挥动着双臂，一副气急败坏的样子。)</td></tr><tr><td>On your part also there is, or would be ordinarily, a rather extensive expenditure of energies, and I am attempting to minimize this also.I do not want to take any energy from your own work, and with training the end result will be an extra reservoir of energy.</td><td>还有，在你的这边也有，或通常会有相当大量的能量消耗，我也会试着把这降到最低。我不想要拿走你们用在自己工作上的能量，经过训练，最终结果，将是一个额外的能量库。</td></tr><tr><td>As far as the projected scientific experiments are concerned, we unfortunately will have to deal with matters that are basically unimportant, merely to convince others.Your scientists will find this true also.</td><td>就计划的科学实验而言，不幸的是，我们将不得不处理一些基本上不重要的事情，只是为了说服别人。你们的科学家也会发现这一点)</td></tr><tr><td>We are working slow in some respects, but building a firm foundation.Experiments will be conducted, for example, as far as traveling through your camouflage space is concerned; and not only will this traveling be effected, but the physical form must be apparent to others in two places at once, so to speak.Material must be carefully gathered by the personality in its secondary location, to make such experiments effective in scientific circles.</td><td>我们在某些方面进展缓慢，但正在建立一个坚实的基础。实验会进行，比方说，就穿越你们的伪装空间而言；不仅这种旅行将被实现，而且物质形态必须在两个地方同时让别人看到，为了使这样的实验在科学界行之有效，在第二个地点的人格必须小心收集资料。</td></tr><tr><td>In all probability there will be some failures, but there will be many successes, and the fear of failure will be our worst inhibiting factor.On a few occasions, with Ruburt’s growing training and with his consent, and with yours, we may have to try a somewhat deeper trance state, but this would only be occasionally, and with your consent.</td><td>很可能会有一些失败，但也会有很多成功，而害怕失败将会是我们最严重的障碍。偶尔，随着鲁柏日益增长的训练，在他和你的同意下，我们可能得尝试更深一点的出神状态，但这只能是偶尔为之，而且要经过)你们的同意。</td></tr><tr><td>As for you, your abilities are latently of the highest quality, but you also bring up inhibiting barriers that I hope will vanish.In some respects Ruburt long ago developed his ability to draw upon basic energy.If we can, and we can, overcome his quite natural fears and inhibitions, we can all use this ability with most beneficial results.He thinks he is undisciplined.Actually he early recognized his ability to draw upon added energy, and somewhat feared it.</td><td>至于你，你的能力潜藏着最高品质，但你也带来了抑制性的障碍，我希望这些障碍会消失。在某些方面，鲁柏早已发展出他汲取基本能量的能力。如果我们可以，而且我们一定可以，克服他那十分自然的恐惧和压抑的话，我们就可以利用这种能力，取得最有利的结果。他认为他不自律。其实他早就认识到自己汲取附加能量的能力，但有点怕它。</td></tr><tr><td>Your reservoirs are also deep, and your inhibitions, while not as conscious and blatant as Ruburt’s, are nevertheless quite as strong.</td><td>你的储藏库也很深，还有你的压抑也很深，虽然不像鲁柏的压抑那么有意识，那么显眼，但仍然相当强烈。</td></tr><tr><td>If your

eventually it should be disconnected from camouflage physical material.</td><td>我想要讨论一下可以在实验室里进行，有着明确、有效结果的实验。心灵感应应是一种，当然，但最终它应该脱离伪装的物质资料。</td></tr><tr><td>The use of psychological time is a basic necessity for any experiment.Such use of psychological time is extremely important, since it enables the personality to bypass physical laws to a large extent; and also, and this is important, bypass certain chemical reactions that would ordinarily occur, and tend to overtax the physical structure.</td><td>心理时间的运用对于任何实验都是基本的要件。这样运用心理时间是极其重要的，因为它使人格在很大程度上绕过了物质法则；而且，这一点也很重要，它还能绕过某些通常会发生的化学反应，而这些反应往往会使物理结构过度疲劳。</td></tr><tr><td>This have been a very good session.I could go on for hours.I will not out of deference, though I am tempted.In Triev there were nights where we talked, and now again there are nights where we talk.</td><td>这是一节非常好的课。我可以讲上好几个小时。虽然我很想说，但出于尊重，我不会考虑。在特里耶夫)(Triev)，我们在有些晚上彻夜畅谈，现在我们又再度在这里彻夜畅谈。</td></tr><tr><td>(It will be remembered that Seth has made many references to the fact that the three of

do want to go into a discussion of animal fragmentation.The idea that animals are sacred is not as farfetched as it may sound.</td><td>要跟你们说的东西太多，你们能理解的又太少。未来某一天，我确实想谈论一下动物的片段。动物是神圣的，这个观点并不像听起来那么牵强。</td></tr><tr><td>The street is quiet, and were I poetic I would have more to say.My existence is more varied than you can imagine.You will have no fear of death and none of life when our sessions are through, and I will continue them as long as you are willing.There is no plane of existence which you cannot inhabit, there is no barrier that you cannot cross.Nothing is ever wasted, and no motion or breath is lost.</td><td>街上很安静，要是我有诗人的才情，我会说得更多。我的存在比你们能够想像的还要变化多端。当我们的课结束后，你们将无惧死亡，无惧生命，只要你们愿意，我就会继续说下去。没有什么存在的层面是你们不能居住的，没有什么障碍是你们不能跨越的。没有任何东西会被浪费，也没有任何运动或呼吸会丢失。</td></tr><tr><td>These sessions represent what you might call previews of eternity, in that you are to some extent receptors of thought that is not hampered by time, and of a companionship that has not ceased with the stirring of the centuries, and with a valid emotional relationship that has escaped the camouflage aspect of physical reality.</td><td>这些课程代表了你们可以称之为永恒的预览(previewsofeternity)，因为你们在某种程度上是不受时间阻碍的思想受体，也是没有随着世纪的激荡而停止的伙)伴，有着一份确实的情感关系，它摆脱了物质实相的伪装面向。</td></tr><tr><td>I can and will give you further proofs, not only of my

see.</td><td>我可以，也将会给你们进一步的证明，不仅证明我的本体身份(identity)，而且证明你们自己的本体身份。广阔的现在包围着你，但没有关住你，我的话将引领你们继续前进。也许会有干扰，甚至有些扭曲，但从长远来看，不会有任何疑虑。你最好的绘画，以及鲁伯最好的著作，也会反映出连你们的科学家都会看到的内在实相。</td></tr><tr><td>Proofs will be given that cannot be denied.Messages will be received that no one else can know.Our foundation is being built now, and it will be firm.At later dates, for your own personal edification, we will discuss lives that you have lived and lessons that you have learned.You will see others helped through your efforts, and advances made where there were none.</td><td>会给你们提供无法否认的证据。你们将收到别人无法知道的信息。我们正在建立根基，它将是牢固的。在)以后的日子里，为了你们个人的启迪，我们会讨论你们活过的生生世世，以及你们学到的功课。你们会看到，其他人通过你们的努力得到的帮助和前所未有的进步。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane’s delivery now was very slow and

our quiet and intimate sessions, and never will suggest that they all be witnessed.Nevertheless, witnesses will prove an asset when you feel ready, and suitable ones are found.By all means experiment with psychological time, both of you, for there confidence is to be found.</td><td>我要慢慢来，以免吓到你们。当你们有证人时，效果和知识就会显示出来。我不想终止我们安静而亲密的课程的平静，也绝不会建议让所有的课程都有证人。然而，当你觉得准备好了，并且找到合适的证人时，证人将被证明是一种资产。无论如何，你们俩都要试验一下心理时间，因为在那里可以找到自信。</td></tr><tr><td>As much as I truly regret closing the session I will do so, so that you can get your sleep.However I am often here, and my energy pervades the chair Joseph, upon which you sit, and the pen with which you write.I hesitate even

laughed.)</td><td>(珍笑着说。)</td></tr><tr><td>However, if you invited me to stay longer then of course I would.In any case you had better break.Ruburt’s hand sensation is now most obvious, representing as it does merely a small and insignificant aspect of the extension of self which I mentioned earlier.When this first occurs the natural reaction is to translate it in terms of physical camouflage data, so that you get a corresponding enlargement of tissues.Take your break or end the session.</td><td>不过，如果你邀请我多待一会儿，我当然乐意。无论怎样，你最好还是休息好了。鲁柏的手的肿胀感觉现在很明显，像以往一样，它所代表的只是我前面提到的，自己的延伸的一个微不足道的小面向。当这种情况第一次发生时，自然的反应是把它转换为物质伪装资料，所以你得到了相对应的组织扩大。你可以休息或结束课程。</td></tr><tr><td>("Well, regretfully

your terms, then there is also a new beginning.</td><td>我想说的是，鲁伯给出的4月15日的日期与卡拉汉小姐有关，以及我所说的危机时，资料并没有被扭曲。她的自我已经放弃了挣扎。它意识到它将不会被消除。清醒的时刻会一闪即逝。她现在基本上是满意了，从她自己的直接经验中领悟到，死亡只是涉及一个转换，以你们的术语来说，如果有一个结束，那么)也就有一个新的开始。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane rapped

fragmentary apparitions that he has seen, for he has actually seen more fragmentary apparitions than he realizes, many of these have been fragmentary through his own inability to organize the material from the inner senses.</td><td>显然，在某种程度上，他已经能够运用自己的内在感官了。他实际见过的零碎幻影，其实比他意识到的还要多，然而，他所看到的零星幻影，其中许多都是由于他自己无法整理内在感官的资料而产生的零碎幻)象。</td></tr><tr><td>That is, because he "saw" (in quotes) a partial apparition, this does not mean that the so-called apparition was in itself not whole, he only perceived part.His abilities are natively strong in this respect.What is needed is additional inner confidence, and even the development of inner discipline.</td><td>也就是说，因为他"看到"(加引号)一个局部的幻影，这并不意味着所谓的幻影本身不完整，而是他只能感知到其中的一部分。他在这方面的能力，天生就很)强。他需要的是更多的内在自信，甚至是内在纪律的培养。</td></tr><tr><td>The discipline, for Mark or for anyone else, is difficult to achieve, in that what is necessary is a passive discipline rather than an aggressive discipline.The passive discipline allows for a fuller perception.It also helps prevent the conscious ego from snapping too quickly back, as is what happens often in Mark’s case.</td><td>纪律，对马克或其他任何人来说，都很难做到，因为需要的是一种被动的纪律，而不是一种积极的纪律。被动的纪律可以让人有更充分的认知。它还有助于防止有意识的自我过快地回过神来，在马克身上就常常发生这种状况。</td></tr><tr><td>This passive discipline also allows inner data enough durability to be realized.Mark needs to wait and listen longer when such experiences present themselves.He accepts them, but then in an intellectual attempt to capture them he smothers them to death.</td><td>这种被动的纪律，也允许内在资料有足够的持久性来了解。当这样的经验出现时，马克需要更长时间的等待和倾听。他接受它们，但是在理智上却试图捕获它们，结果把它们给扼杀了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's delivery had by now slowed up considerably.She pointed at Bill, sitting

suggest that Mark also exercise himself in the use of psychological time.He should progress fairly rapidly.His impulsive nature is actually somewhat more restrained in this life than it was in the previously past life.Nevertheless, one of the problems for the personality is still the need for a more disciplined ego.</td><td>这一个，那一个，都是你最喜欢的其中一个，并且也是鲁柏最喜欢的其中一个，为此，我自己的确也感觉到了一股温暖。我建议马克也锻炼一下自己对心理时间的运用。他的进步应该相当快。他冲动的本性，在这一世其实比先前的一世收敛多了。不过，对于人格来说，其中一个问题还是需要一个更有纪律的自我。</td></tr><tr><td>Three lives ago, Mark was

erratic.You might say that Mark was too erratic to be erotic.He at that time was fairly wealthy, and gave away much money in a subconscious attempt to make up for the aggressive and cruel male existence just previous.</td><td>他那时反覆无常。你可以说马克太不稳定(erratic)，不可能有性趣(erotic)。当时的他非常富有，捐出很多钱财，因为潜意识里，他在试图弥补之前身为男性那一世的残暴。</td></tr><tr><td>The choice in the past life of a woman’s personality represented a somewhat understandable weakness on his part, and yet it also represented bravery in a sense.</td><td>前世选择了一个女性人格，代表了他的一个有些可以理解的弱点，然而这也代表着某种意义上的勇敢。</td></tr><tr><td>The impulsive and warm quality began with that Midwest existence as a woman.Through the erratic nature of the woman’s personality he was actually able to be much kinder.A male's personality at that point would have held too many temptations as far as over aggressiveness and cruelty were concerned.</td><td>冲动和温情的品质，始于中西部身为女人的那一世。透过女性人格的反覆无常，他其实能够善良许多。就过度的好斗和残酷而言，一个男性人格在那个时候会有太多的诱因。</td></tr><tr><td>("Can you tell us just where

this existence in order to pay an old debt.He was unkind to her when she was a wife to him, and here we run into another case where the subconscious knows what it knows.</td><td>他这一世的母亲，在他过度好斗的那一世，是他的妻子，他选择在这一世当她的儿子，以便偿还旧债。当她是他的妻子时，他对她很不仁慈，这里我们又遇到了一个案例，潜意识知道它知道什么。</td></tr><tr><td>His mother now subconsciously remembers that earlier existence, and his unfeeling attitude as a husband.This is a beautiful example.Mark still attempts to override an earlier propensity toward insensitiveness, and is therefore now sensitive and impulsive.</td><td>他现在的母亲，下意识地记得过去的那一世，以及他作为丈夫无情的态度。这是一个很好的例子。马克仍然试图克服前世的那种麻木不仁的习性，因此，现在敏感又冲动。</td></tr><tr><td>His present mother, remembering subconsciously past transgressions of his, now counts upon his impulsive nature and sensitivity to pay him back, this of course representing a mistake on her part, for which she will have to suffer the consequences in still another existence.</td><td>他现在的母亲，在潜意识里记得他过去的过失，现在就仗着他的冲动天性和敏感来报复他，这当然代表了她的一个错误，为此她将不得不在另一次存在中承受后果。</td></tr><tr><td>Mark's whole family, in fact, have been in one way or another connected in a rather unusual manner through at least three successive existences, and the family of course has interchanged roles accordingly.They are still working out old problems, and in some cases are doing very well.</td><td>马克的整个家族，事实上，已经至少连续三世以某种很不寻常的方式连结在一起，当然，家族成员也相应地进行了角色更换。他们还在解决老问题，有些情况下还做得非常好。</td></tr><tr><td>There is also another member of this particular family who is presently a woman, and there is also another member who is presently a man.Neither of these two were intimately connected with Mark’s family for the past two lives, and represent the only

not only because paintings certainly should possess beauty, but because they instill positive creative thoughts in the mind of the beholder.</td><td>任何艺术形式都会触及到几代人。业(Karma)可以通过很多方式来解决，这里我们再度回到马克先前男性取向的激进人格。这一次，通过创造绘画中的美，他不仅仅只是弥补了过去的错误；不仅因为绘画当然应该拥有美感，而且因为绘画在观者心中注入了积极的创造性思想。</td></tr><tr><td>Mark’s present family is composed of a peculiarly vivid meshwork of previous complications.The involvement has been beneficial as far as Mark is concerned thus far.However the situation should now be altered.</td><td>马克当前的家庭，是由一张特别鲜明的前世纠葛之网组成的。到目前为止，就马克而言，这种牵缠是有益的。但现在这个情况，应该要改变了。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take your break;

the last time was during an overnight stopover in New Paltz, when Jane and I were on our way to York Beach, Maine, on vacation.It will be recalled that it was in the dance hall at York Beach that Jane and I saw the projected fragments of our own personalities, that Seth dealt with so extensively in the 9th session, of December 18, 1963.

since I did not have it typed up yet I began to read it to him.It was quite hilarious and we had some laughs over it; but as I finished reading at about 9:45 PM, I became aware that I was experiencing a feeling of enlargement in the index and second finger of my right hand.Bill stated that in his opinion these two fingers were noticeably "fatter" than the corresponding two on my left hand.I then cut narrow strips of paper and had Bill measure and mark the circumference of each finger, planning to check these measurements when the sensation had passed.This is the system I plan to use to check Jane's hands also.</td><td>(比尔想再听一次他见证的第四十六节课的记录，因为我还没有打字出来，所以我开始读给他听，相当好笑，我们对此大笑不已；但是当我在晚上9点45分读完的时候，我发现我的右手食指和二指有肿大的感觉。比尔说，在他看来，这两个手指明显比我左手对应的两个手指要"胖"。于是我剪了些窄纸条，让比尔测量并标记每个手指的周长，打算在这感觉过去后，再检查这些测量值。我也打算用这种方式来测量珍的手。</td></tr><tr><td>(At the time I noticed my hand phenomena, our cat Willy began to charge about the premises in a most active display.At the same time, Jane said that she thought she felt Seth stirring about, since all of us had talked about him constantly for some time now.I readied my pens and paper, just in case.</td><td>(就在我注意到手的现象时，我们的猫威利开始横冲直撞，活泼得不得了。与此同时，珍说，她觉得赛斯在骚动，因为我们全都在不停地谈论他。我准备好我的笔和纸，以防万一。</td></tr><tr><td>(I then showed Jim and Bill the two drawings of my visions of the night before; I did the drawings this afternoon.The drawing of the head, with the brimming eyes, struck Jim rather forcibly.In his quiet way he said the drawing was very disturbing to him, and mentioned this several times after I had put them away.Both Jim and Bill thought the other one, of the girl and dog, quite gruesome.As it happened, both drawings were rather successful; I felt I had done a good job of getting my memory of the visions down on paper.</td><td>(我向吉姆和比尔展示了，根据前天晚上看到的心象，所画出的两幅画；我是今天下午画的。那张泪水溢眶的头像震撼了吉姆。他以惯有的平静口吻说，这幅画让他深感不安，而且在我把画收起来之后，他又提了几次。吉姆和比尔两个人都认为，另一张女孩和狗的画，令人毛骨悚然。从他们的反应来看，两张画都画得相当成功；我觉得我凭记忆把内视心象画在纸上，画得很出色。</td></tr><tr><td>(At 10:25 Jane abruptly handed to me a paper and pencil and pointed to the table.I had my own equipment handy however, and grabbed them up.Jane began to dictate then in a strong and somewhat deeper voice, pacing rather energetically.It was the first session with more than one witness.Note, also, that at the close of the 46th session, Seth had remarked that he would "speak to you Monday if not before.")</td><td>(10:25珍突然递给我纸笔，并指了指桌子。不过我自己也早有准备，一把抓起纸笔。珍开始用强而有力的声音传述，步伐相当有力，能量十足。这是第一次超过一个证人的课程。还请注意，在第46节课结尾，赛)斯曾表示过，"如果没有提前的话，我下个星期一再来与你们聊"。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will speak briefly so that you will know that I am here.I have been listening to your discussions; before we are through, we will gather together a circle of acquaintances, all of whom we have known before.</td><td>我简单说几句，好让你们知道我在这里。我一直在听你们讨论；在我们的课结束之前，我们这些熟人将齐聚一堂，全都是以前我们认识的熟人。</td></tr><tr><td>It will take three years at least before they will all be drawn here, but then we will be able to really do something, and our work will show un-heard of results.</td><td>至少要3年的时间，他们才会被吸引到这里来，不过到时候，我们就能够真的做些什么，而我们的工作也会展现前所未有的成果。</td></tr><tr><td>Your guest this evening did not merely happen to come upon your acquaintance, though free will does operate, as I have maintained.Nevertheless Roarck, Ro-ar-ck, also has his subconscious memories, and he remembers the times when we were together.</td><td>你们今天晚上的客人，并不仅仅是你们碰巧遇到的熟人，但是，我说过，自由意志确实在运作。虽然如此，洛克(Roarck)，R-o-a-r-c-k，也有他的潜意识记忆，他记得我们以往曾在一起的时光。</td></tr><tr><td>Nor is it any coincidence that the picture which you drew as a result of your vision struck him so forcibly.Roarck is the name of your acquaintance; it is the name of Jim’s entity, and about this I will have more to say.</td><td>你从内视的心象画出的两幅画，如此强烈地打动他，也不是巧合。洛克是你的熟人的名字；它是吉姆的存有的名字，关于这点，我还有更多的话要说。</td></tr><tr><td>His abilities along electronic lines are not at all surprising, having been developed in various ways through previous existences.He was involved with esoteric religious ceremonies and concerned with certain religious, scientific, and psychic experiments long before your continent was civilized.He was a priest 4,000 years ago.</td><td>他在电子方面具有的能力是不令人意外的，因为他以各种不同的方式发展这些能力已经好几世了。他远在你们大陆文明之前，就已经涉足秘传的宗教仪式，并关注某些宗教、科学和灵性实验。他在4000年前是一个神职人员。</td></tr><tr><td>These abilities have manifested themselves in various ways, and he has often taken upon himself tasks also of a sacrificial nature.In past lives he never enjoyed the fleshy nature with which you Joseph, and Ruburt, and Mark were so outlandishly endowed. He was in almost all cases an esthetic personality, four times a woman; two of these times a priestess, and once as a nun in the Middle Ages.The personality in many respects has been rigid, in that its purpose was so undeviatingly certain and severe that it allowed no room for levity or diversion.</td><td>这些能力以各种方式表现出来，他也经常承担一些具有自我牺牲性质的任务。在过去的几世中，他从来没有享受过你约瑟、鲁柏和马克所具有的如此惊人的肉体禀赋，在几乎所有的情况中，他都是一个审美型人格(estheticpersonality)，四次当女人；其中有两次是女祭师，一次是中世纪的修女。这种人格在许多方面都是刻板的，因为它的目的是如此毫不动摇地明确和严谨，容不下任何的轻浮或消遣。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, the pattern begins to make itself known.The rigidity, while conducive to the development of creativity, also has temptations, in that a certain pride can become psychically sterile or ingrown.However in this existence the personality has opened up to a more considerable degree, and for its own development should continue to do so.</td><td>再次地，模式开始显示它自己。那种刻板，虽然有利于创造力的发展，同时也有它的诱惑，表现为某种傲慢可以成为灵性上的荒芜或萎缩。不过在这一世，这个人格已经开放到比较可观的程度，为了自身的发展，应该继续这样做。</td></tr><tr><td>This session is outside of our regular sessions because I have known that Roarck would finally be drawn here, and it is for his benefit that I have called the session.There are others who will come.Do not, however, consider that you yourselves have truth in the palm of your hands.</td><td>这次课程是在我们的常规课程之外，因为我早就知道，洛克最终会被吸引到这里来，我召开这节课是为了帮助他。还有其他人会来。但是，不要认为真理就在你们的手掌心。</td></tr><tr><td>Truth contains no distortions, and this material with all my best efforts, and with yours, of necessity must contain distortions merely in order to make itself exist at all on your plane.I will never condone an attitude in which either you or Ruburt maintain that you hold undiluted truth through these sessions.</td><td>真理不包含扭曲。而这份资料，尽管我和你们都付出了最大的努力，但仅只是为了让它存在于你们的层面，它就必然会含有扭曲。我绝对不会纵容你或鲁柏持着一种态度，认为透过这些课程，掌握了未稀释的真理。</td></tr><tr><td>Any material, to exist on your plane, must to some extent don the attire of your plane, and in the very entry to your plane it must be somewhat distorted.I must use phrases with which your minds are somewhat familiar.I must use Ruburt’s subconscious to some degree.If I did not take advantage of your own camouflage system, then you would not be able to understand the material at this time.</td><td>任何资料，要存在于你们的层面，一定得在某种程度披上你们层面的装束，而在进入你们层面的时候，它必须有些扭曲。我必须使用你们心智中有些熟悉的词语。我必须某种程度利用鲁柏的潜意识。如果我不利用你们自己的伪装系统，那么你们这时候，没有办法了解这份资料。</td></tr><tr><td>Inner data, even this, must make its entry through some distortion.We must always work together, but you must never consider me as an infallible source.This material is more valid than any material possible on your plane, but it is nevertheless to some degree conditioned by the camouflage attributes of the plane.</td><td>即使是内在资料，也必须经由某种扭曲才进得来。我们必须一直合作，但你们绝对不能把我当作一个不会出错的来源。这份资料比你们层面上任何可得的资料都更加有理有据，但它还是在一定程度上，受到层面)的伪装属性的制约。</td></tr><tr><td>There must be no rigidity here.This is a living, vital and valid experiment.I suggest that all you take a brief break, and if you are in accord then I will continue for a short time.However, I want to make it plain that we are certainly not setting up a new dogma.By all means take your break.</td><td>在我们这里一定不能僵化刻板。这是一个活生生的、重要的和有根据的实验。我建议你们大家稍微休息一下，如果你们愿意，我会再继续一小会。不过，我要清楚地表明，我们绝对不是在建立一个新的教条。休息一下吧。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:45.Jane was dissociated as usual.She said that something had made Seth angry this evening; she thought it had to do with our attitude and comments after we had received the letter from the A.S.P.R.</td><td>(10:45休息。珍解离如常。她说，今天晚上某件事情惹赛斯生气；她认为一定是和我们收到美国心灵协会的信后，我们的态度和所持的评论有关。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jim reported that he felt strong chills as the session got underway, and that he still felt them to a lesser degree during break.When Jane began dictating again her voice was as strong as before, and as emphatic.Resume at 10:50.)</td><td>(吉姆说，当课程开始时，他感觉到强烈的寒意，休息时，他仍然感觉到些微的寒意。当珍再次开始传述时，她的声音仍和以前一样有力、一样加强语气。10:50继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt was quite correct.I found both of your attitudes earlier this evening to be extremely smug.You find it easy to blame others for not having the knowledge that you have thus far obtained, when you forget that I had much to do with choosing who would receive the knowledge.The situation and the time and the growth of your own abilities had something to do with this.While I am certainly not one given to humility, nevertheless your smugness is truly astronomical.</td><td>鲁柏说的很对。今晚稍早时，我发现你们两个的态度极端地自以为是。你们很轻易地就责怪别人没有你们迄今为止所获得的知识，却忘了选择谁来接收这个知识，与我大有关系。形势和时间以及你们自身能力的成长都与此有关。虽然我并非十足的谦虚，但你们也实在是太跩了吧。</td></tr><tr><td>You are after all not idols automatically given cosmic knowledge, and the rest of struggling humanity is not to be treated as imbecilic, whether it is imbecilic or not.</td><td>你们毕竟不是自动被赋予宇宙知识的天之骄子，其余在挣扎中的人类，不该被当成低能儿对待，无论他们是否低能。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane pounded upon the table, although smiling.)</td><td>(珍虽然在笑着，却一拳击在桌上。)</td></tr><tr><td>All this involves training.It involves discipline, and then there is freedom.The esthetic nature inherent in Roarcks personality will equip him to follow along very well.Let him also take to heart my little sermon on humility.Mark can forget it.His personality needs all the building up it can get.</td><td>这一切都涉及到训练。它涉及到纪律，然后还有自由。洛克人格中固有的审美天性，将使他能够很好地遵循。让他也把我关于谦逊的布道放在心上。马克则可以免了。他的人格需要所有能得到的培训。</td></tr><tr><td>(It will be recalled that Mark is the name Seth has given to Bill’s entity.)</td><td>(应该记得，马克是赛斯给比尔存有的名字。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have said the universe, that is the inner universe, does expand, but does not expand in space.For Roarcks benefit, ideas, theories, plans, capabilities expand, but do not take up more space.And so does the universe expand, but space is merely a camouflage, useful to you for a time, constructed through the use of mental enzymes, subconsciously and only for a brief span.</td><td>我曾经说过，宇宙，即内在宇宙，确实在膨胀，但不是在空间膨胀。为了洛克能明白，想法、理论、计划和能力都会扩张，但不会占用更多的空间。内在宇宙也是如此，但空间只是一种伪装，对你暂时有用，透过精神酵素来构建，下意识地，只在弹指之间。</td></tr><tr><td>Behind the camouflage true reality exists.I have hinted at experiments to be tried, and we will go into these.Through the use of age regression and hypnosis, you will be able with effort and discipline to prove the existence of reincarnation.Records will be found.</td><td>在这个伪装的背后，存在真正的实相。我已经暗示了要尝试的实验，我们将进入这些实验。通过使用年龄回溯(ageregression)和催眠，通过努力和纪律，你将能够证明轮回的存在。记录将会被发现)</td></tr><tr><td>Hypnosis is at best a poor tool.A light trance state, self induced, can yield excellent results in a subject who is trained along these lines.Later we will go into other experiments.As I have said, so-called space travel will be mainly divorced from vehicles, and the use of psychological time is the very first step in this direction.</td><td>催眠，充其量也只是一个差劲的工具。自己诱导的一种轻微出神状态，对于一个在这方面受过训练的人，就可以得到很好的结果。稍后我们再谈其他实验。正如我所说，所谓的太空旅行，主要是与载具分开，而心理时间的运用正是朝着这个方向迈出的第一步。</td></tr><tr><td>The barriers are yours.The barriers are camouflage.It is ridiculous to develop camouflage vehicles to deal with camouflage space, when all that is necessary is that you realize that camouflage is camouflage.Therefore the barrier disappears. We will have much more to say along these lines.When you realize that time as you know it does not exist, then vehicles become unnecessary.</td><td>障碍是你们的。障碍是伪装。开发伪装载具来往伪装空间是很可笑的，其实只是你意识到，伪装就是伪装，障碍就消失了。在这方面我们还有更多的要谈。当你们了悟到你们所知的时间并不存在时，载具就变得没有必要了。</td></tr><tr><td>Roarck, in one of his past existences, was concerned with just such problems.However the society with which he was involved was of course seeped in its own ignorance, as your society is seeped in its now.</td><td>洛克，在他过去的一个存在中，关注的正是这样的问题。然而，他所身处的社会，当然是沉浸在自己的无知中，就像你们的社会，现在也沉浸在无知中一样。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not going to hold a long session.This is merely in the lines of an introduction, and may I here welcome Roarck to the session.There will be more to come, and many will seem as accidental as Roarcks happening into your household.</td><td>我不打算上一节长课。这只是一个介绍，让我在此欢迎洛克加入这堂课。还会有更多的人加入，而且很多人看起来就像洛克一样，偶然进入到你们家。</td></tr><tr><td>I am pleased that Mark is following my suggestions.Teachers are somewhere near the room in which his painting should be found.</td><td>我很高兴马克听进了我的建议。他会在附近都是老师的某个房间里找到他的画。</td></tr><tr><td>The one room is extremely large.There is the sound of activity.The picture I believe was once between two walls.Somewhere nearby is the color red, perhaps in a linoleum.The picture is undamaged, though I seem to see two small marks in the lower lefthand corner.</td><td>这个房间非常大。有活动的声音。这幅画我相信曾经在两面墙之间。附近某处有红色，也许在一块油布里面。这幅画完好无损，不过我似乎看到左下角有两个小印痕。</td></tr><tr><td>If you are of the mind, Joseph, you may subtract the minutes of tonight’s session from your next session.However, I would personally think it rather small.</td><td>如果你有这个想法，约瑟，你可以从下节课中扣掉今晚上课的时间。不过，我个人觉得它微不足道。</td></tr><tr><td>("I never thought of it.")</td><td>("我从来没有想过要那样做"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Some night I will address many people, all of whom knew me, and many of whom knew each other.When Ruburt's abilities mature, and when if ever he is able to forget that awesome ego, we will really show some signs.I was not originally in favor of gaudy displays.However, your precious Psychic Society has made me feel as if I would like to give them a good boot.</td><td>总有一天晚上，我将会对很多人说话，他们全都认识我，而且其中很多彼此也认识。当鲁柏的能力成熟了，当他有朝一日终于能够忘记那了不起的自我时，我们将真正显示出一些迹象。我原本不喜欢浮夸的表演。然而，你们那尊贵的心灵协会让我觉得，我好像)想给他们一个好的引导。</td></tr><tr><td>Since this is an unscheduled session I will not keep you, but I am extremely pleased, both because Mark finally made it to a session the other night, finally after knowing about the sessions for months, and also that Roarck has finally been drawn here.As a footnote, Roarck, you came too early the first time.I was not ready yet.</td><td>由于这是一节临时课，我就不再耽搁你们了，但我非常高兴，一是马克在前几天晚上终于来上课了，在知道这些课好几个月之后终于来了，二是因为洛克终于被吸引到这里来。补充一点，洛克，你第一次来的时候太早了。我当时还没准备好。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, before poor maligned Joseph’s hand falls off through sheer weariness, I will end our brief session, as always with my own regrets.</td><td>现在，在约瑟可怜的、疲惫的手累到掉下来之前，带着向来都有的遗憾之情，我将结束我们的短课。</td></tr><tr><td>("What are you going to do now, Seth?")</td><td>("你现在打算去干什么，赛斯？")</td></tr><tr><td>You try to trick me.I do not do anything in the terms to which you refer, and my activities parallel your own only in a very slight manner.There is a quality of value existence and extension with which you are not familiar, and a pulsation that I cannot yet make you understand.</td><td>你想套我的话。我不做任何你所谓的任何事，我的活动与你们自己的活动仅在非常轻微的程度上平行。有一种你们不熟悉的"值的存在"与延伸的品质，还有一种我还无法让你们理解的脉动。</td></tr><tr><td>("Why did I have some enlargement in my hand before this session started?")</td><td>("为什么在这节课开始之前，我的手有些肿大？")</td></tr><tr><td>Your pussycat knew, or sensed, that I was here.You sensed it, hence the swelling of your hands, which is only a symptom of the workings of one particular inner sense.Roarck knew it when he saw your picture.</td><td>你们的猫咪知道，或者感觉到了我在这里。你感觉到了，所以你的手才会肿起来，那只是某个内在感官运)作的一个征兆罢了。洛克一看到你的画就知道了。</td></tr><tr><td>("What is the significance of that drawing to him?")</td><td>("那幅画对他有什么意义？")</td></tr><tr><td>The picture which you drew was the result of a vision you received last night, and my dear friends, the picture represents two things.I suggest a brief break, and I will then go into the picture’s significance.</td><td>你画的这幅画，是你昨晚收到的心象的结果，我亲爱的朋友，这幅画代表了两件事。我建议大家先休息一下，然后我再来探讨这幅画的意义。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:15.Jane was fully dissociated.Jim felt more comfortable now, his chills had abated;

measurable duration.I never did open the window for her.</td><td>(然而，我一直没有离开我的位置，就在敞开的办公室门口，我没有看到任何人，也不记得办公室本身的其他情况。我看着女孩费力地想打开窗，看了好几秒钟，时间长到足以让这个心象持续了一段明确、可测量的时间。我从来没有为她打开过窗户。</td></tr><tr><td>(I then "came to" on the bed, sat up, and saw that it was 8:45 PM.While watching the girl, I had no sensation, or memory or awareness, of lying on the bed.I went into the living room to immediately describe the experience to Jane.)</td><td>(然后，我"来到"床上，坐起来，一看，时间是8:45。在看那个女孩的时候，我没有躺在床上的感觉，也没有任何记忆和意识。我立即走进客厅，向珍描述这一段经历。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 48</td><td>第48节出体旅行,死亡感觉</td></tr><tr><td>APRIL 27, 1964 9 PM MONDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964年4月27日星期一晚上9点按指示</td></tr><tr><td>(At 4:45 PM, while talking to Jane in the kitchen as she prepared supper, I experienced the now familiar feeling of enlargement in my right hand.It centered in my palm, and my index and second fingers.I immediately thought it might be an inner sense telling me that Seth was around.</td><td>(下午4:45，当珍在厨房准备晚餐，而我正在和她聊天时，我经历了那现在我已很熟悉的右手增大的感觉。它集中在我的手掌，以及食指和中指之间。我立刻想到，这可能是一种内在感官，告诉我赛斯就在附近。</td></tr><tr><td>(A few minutes later I thought of checking finger circumferences again, as I had with Bill Macdonnel before the 47th session; see page 41.By then the sensation had receded a bit, but I obtained a measurement of 2 1/2 ’’for my second finger at 4:50.An hour later the circumference had shrunk a bit, to 2 15/32.I feel there would have been a greater difference if I had taken a prompt first measurement.</td><td>(几分钟后，我想到了再去测量一下手指的周长，就像在第47节课之前与比尔·麦克唐纳做的一样。到了)4:50分，感觉已经消退了一点，但我对中指的测量结)果是21/2''吋。一个小时后，中指的周长缩小了一)点，为215/32"。我觉得如果在一开始就进行测量的话，可能会有更大的差距。</td></tr><tr><td>(At 6:30, and for the next hour or so, I noticed many small instances of my familiar tingling or thrilling sensation; it finally localized in back of my ears.</td><td>(6:30，在接下来的一个多小时里，我注意到了许多我熟悉的刺痛或刺激的感觉；它最后集中在我耳朵的后方。</td></tr><tr><td>(At 8:30 Jane and I tried psychological time.Jane did not notice anything; I obtained the results detailed on page 48.</td><td>(8:30，我和珍尝试了心理时间。珍没有注意到任何情况；我获得了上面详细介绍的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>(By 8:50 Jane was nervous as usual.Willy slept on the couch.I had paper tapes ready to check Jane’s finger circumferences if the occasion arose.Jane began dictating at 9 PM in a soft and low voice, her eyes darkened as usual and her pace was slow.)</td><td>(到了8:50，珍像往常一样紧张。威利睡在沙发上。我准备了小纸条，如果有必要的话，可以检查珍手指的围度。珍在9点开始传述，声音低沉、柔和，眼睛像往常一样漆黑，步伐缓慢。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>After our impromptu session the other evening, I did not know whether or not you would be waiting for me tonight, after the extra typing that was involved.</td><td>在我们那天晚上的即兴课程之后，我不知道你们今晚会不会等我，因为还要多打那么多的字。</td></tr><tr><td>("I have that typing all done.")</td><td>("我的打字全部完成了"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Congratulations.Actually, I had intended to give you the evening off; however, we will have a short session.Unless of course you would prefer an evening off, in which case you certainly deserve it.</td><td>恭喜。我本来打算让你们今晚休息的；不管怎样，我们会有一堂短课。当然，除非你们想放一个晚上的假，这也是你们应得的。</td></tr><tr><td>("No, were okay.")</td><td>("不用，我们没事"。)</td></tr><tr><td>The evening is extremely enjoyable, and after having a total of two witnesses in one evening this seems like a very intimate and peaceful session.</td><td>今晚令人非常愉快，在一个晚上有两个见证人之后，似乎今晚是一节很亲密又安静的课。</td></tr><tr><td>Your experience this evening represents a journeying, and I offer you my congratulations.As time passes you will be able to maintain durability, as far as such journeys are concerned.We are only at the threshold.</td><td>你今天晚上的经验代表一种出体旅行，我向你表示祝贺。随着时间的推移，对于这类的旅行，你将能保持更持久。我们才刚刚起步。</td></tr><tr><td>In cases such as these, when durability can be maintained, by all means attempt to speak to any persons that you meet, as in this case you saw the girl at the window; and also ask them to write you at your home address.</td><td>在这类的情况中，当持久性可以维持住的时候，无论如何都要尝试跟任何你遇到的人说话，就像在这个例子里，你看到窗边的女孩一样；还可以让他们写信到你们家的地址来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Such simple expedients had not, of course, occurred to me.But once Seth mentioned them they seemed most obvious.The fact that I had taken a journey was very surprising to me; I had not thought of my experience in that way at all.)</td><td>(这种简单的权宜之计，我当然没有想到。但赛斯一提，它们似乎就再明显不过了。我已经踏上一个出体旅行这个事实，令我非常惊讶；我完全没有想到我的经历是这样的。)</td></tr><tr><td>("Why didn't I see the girl’s face?")</td><td>("为什么我没看到女孩的脸？")</td></tr><tr><td>It will take some time before you will be able to maintain such an experience long enough to make such contact, but if possible give your own name and address, and also ask that whoever you meet write to you.This of course will aid in validity.</td><td>这将需要时间，在你能够保持这样的经验足够长的时间后，就会进行这种接触，但如果可能的话，请提供自己的姓名和地址，也请你遇到的人给你写信。这当)然有助于真实性。</td></tr><tr><td>You saw the back of the girl’s head simply because the girl was standing with her back to you.Had you been able to speak to her, it is probable that she would have turned.Whether or not you were physically assembled when you saw the girl, I do not know.There are many complications here.Journey of your own essence must be achieved first, of course.There are different ways in which such journeying occurs.</td><td>你看到女孩的后脑袋，因为女孩背对着你站着。如果你当时能和她说话，她很可能会转过身来。你看到女孩的时候，你的身体是否有组合成形，我不知道。这里面有很多复杂的因素。你自己的本质一定要先到，这是当然的。有很多不同方式来开展这类出体旅行。</td></tr><tr><td>In some instances the physical body stays in its original location, and the personality essence moves through camouflage space and time.That is, the personality essence, realizing that space and time are merely camouflages, is therefore free to behave accordingly.</td><td>在有些例子中，身体保持在原来的位置上，而人格本质(personality-essence)则穿越伪装的空间和时间。也就是说，人格本质意识到空间和时间只是伪装，因此可以自由地做出相应的行为。</td></tr><tr><td>In this instance of traveling by personality essence, any contact would be telepathic, and a potential observer would see nothing, using the outer senses alone.</td><td>在这个人格本质出体旅行的例子里，任何接触都是心灵感应，一个可能的观察者，仅用外在感官是什么都看不到的。</td></tr><tr><td>("Wouldn’t such an occurrence frighten the observer or recipient?")</td><td>("这样的事件，难道不会吓着观察者或接收者吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>Not in the instance mentioned.Another method is somewhat more complicated and involves a diffusion of energies, a partially visible secondary camouflage body appearing in a new location, while the original body remains in its original position.</td><td>在刚才提到的情况，不会。另一种方法就有些复杂了，涉及到能量的扩散，部分可见的次伪装身体出现)在一个新的地点，而原本的身体还在其原来的位置。</td></tr><tr><td>In this case the body would appear visible on the bed while another, identical body would appear in the new location to which the personality- essence had traveled.In this case a potential observer would see what would appear to be an ordinary physical being.</td><td>在这种情况下，床上的身体清晰可见，而另一个相同的身体，会出现在人格本质旅行到的新地点。在这种情况下，一个可能的观察者，会看到似乎是一个普通的身体存在(physicalbeing)。</td></tr><tr><td>Conversation could then be carried on.There are gradations in the degree of materialization here, in that the secondary body would be absolutely normal appearing in all respects, or could be less so, according to the ability of the traveler.</td><td>然后可以进行对话。这里的物质化程度有等级变化，因为，次伪装身体，根据旅行者的能力，可以在各方面看起来完全正常，或者不那么正常。</td></tr><tr><td>You have done very well this evening.</td><td>你今晚做得很好。</td></tr><tr><td>("Can you tell us anything about the girl I saw?")</td><td>("你能告诉我们，关于我看见的那个女孩的情况吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>The girl was merely a secretary, standing by the window and on her way to another office.</td><td>女孩只是一个秘书，站在窗边，正要去另一间办公室。</td></tr><tr><td>("Did I have the location of the office correct?")</td><td>("办公室的地点我搞对了吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>You did.</td><td>是的。</td></tr><tr><td>Each time you practice with the use of psychological time, you add to your abilities, though results may not always be immediate.There is conditioning involved here, as with anything else, but this represents one of your very highest points so far, and I am certain that you will improve.You show a good deal of ability along this line, and possess an inner willingness to experiment, that will stand you in very good stead.</td><td>每次练习运用心理时间，你都会增加自己的能力，虽然效果不一定立竿见影。这里涉及到条件问题，就像其他任何事情一样，但这代表了你迄今为止的最高点之一，我确信你会进步。你在这方面表现出了很好的能力，也有做实验的内在意愿，这将使你处于非常有利的地位。</td></tr><tr><td>("Is it possible to pick the places I will visit?")</td><td>("是否有可能挑选我要去的地方？")。</td></tr><tr><td>It is possible to pick the places you will visit.Whether or not you can achieve such purposeful visits at this time, I do not know.However, you can most certainly try.You are further along than even I had imagined, and so it is possible that such purposeful visits are within your abilities now.At all such occasions, try to establish some kind of contact if possible, but do not be discouraged if this is not achieved at once.</td><td>可以选择自己要去的地方。你现在是否能实现这种有明确目标的拜访，我不知道。不过，你当然可以试试。你的进展超过我的想像，所以这种目标明确的拜访，有可能在你目前的能力范畴之内。每一次有这种情况的时候，可能的话，尽量建立某种联系，但如果不能马上实现，也不要灰心。</td></tr><tr><td>Your abilities, and Ruburt’s, of course do vary, as is natural, and it is possible that you may be extremely gifted in this particular fashion.</td><td>你的能力，还有鲁柏的能力，当然一定各有不同，这很正常，有可能你在这方面天赋极高。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27.Jane was fairly dissociated.The above material now made us wonder whether my vision of the girl and the dog was also a journeying.See page 39. We made mental notes to ask Seth about it if he did not bring up the subject himself.</td><td>(9:27休息。珍相当解离。以上资料让我们怀疑，我看到的女孩和狗的心象是否也是一种出体。我们在心里记下了，如果赛斯自己没提出这个话题，就去问他。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed dictating in her quiet voice at 9:31.)</td><td>(珍9:31以平静的声音继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>In such experiments, when you attempt purposeful visits, then choose of course people with whom you are familiar and in rapport, so that if you materialize fully they will recognize you as a friend, and follow whatever instructions you are able to give them.Even if you are unable to give them any instructions at all, if you materialize they would of course recognize you, and write you, whether or not any instructions were given.This is a good point to remember.</td><td>在这样的实验中，当你试图进行有目的的访问时，当然要选择你熟悉而且关系融洽的人，这样，如果你完全具体化，他们才认得出你这位朋友，并遵循你能够给他们的任何指示。即使你完全无法给他们任何指示，如果你物质化了，他们当然会认出你，并写信给你。这是一个值得注意的要点。</td></tr><tr><td>For the future, keep still another possibility in mind, that of picking up an object from the location to which you have traveled, and bringing it back with you as proof.This is difficult in the extreme, but it is far from impossible.</td><td>将来，要记住仍有另一种可能，那就是在你旅行过的地点捡一件物品，并把它带回来作为证明。这一点极为困难，但也绝非不可能。</td></tr><tr><td>The reason that these things are done so infrequently is because the personality essence finds itself so unable to give up belief in camouflage time and space.You must be convinced, deeply, not only that such feats are possible, but that you can achieve them; and then you must also train yourself to perfect your own abilities.</td><td>这些事情之所以不常做，是因为人格本质发现自己无法放弃伪装时空的信念。你必须深深地相信，这样的壮举不尽可能，而且你能做到；然后你还必须训练自己，完善自己的能力。</td></tr><tr><td>Failure can lie in any of these lines.A sort of suspension of what you might call logic is necessary before such feats can be performed well enough for there to be a scientific proof, definite enough to be accepted.You must make an emotional and psychic leap, and then you can look backward and see your connective bridges.</td><td>失败的原因可能在于其中任何一方面。在这种壮举能够被很好的执行，以获得科学的证明，并明确到足以被接受之前，一种你可能称之为逻辑的暂停是必要的。你必须在情绪和灵性上有一个飞跃，然后你就可以向后看，看到你的连接桥梁。</td></tr><tr><td>Then you can point these out to others.This is extremely important.There must always be pioneers.There will be gradations and variations that you will find most interesting.If, in such traveling’s, you find yourself in a strange location, then look for signs or landmarks.At first the very uniqueness of such experiences will tend to make you forget.However, an accurate description of a foreign city which you have never visited before, would be of course invaluable.</td><td>然后，你就可以把这些指给别人看。这一点极为重要。总要有先驱者。会有一些层次和变化，你会发现极为有趣。如果在这样的旅行中，你发现自己在一个陌生的地方，那么就寻找标志或地标。起初，这独特的经历常常会让你忘记。然而，对一个你从未去过的外邦城市的准确描述，当然是非常宝贵的。</td></tr><tr><td>If you hear people talking, remember to listen to what they are discussing, and the language in which they speak.Now, I am talking of probability rather than immediate possibility.It is not impossible, however, at all to travel seemingly through time as well as space.I say seemingly because this traveling really has little to do with transportation as such.</td><td>如果你听到人们说话，记得要听他们在讨论什么，用什么语言。现在，我说的是可能性，而不是立即的可能性。不过，看似穿越时间以及空间的旅行，也不是完全不可能。我说"似乎"是因为这种旅行真的和运输本身没有什么关系。</td></tr><tr><td>Since both space and time are camouflages, to speak of traveling through them is basically meaningless.What is involved here is a transformation of energy, and on your plane an extension of personality essence that permits an extension of perception.I will make this clearer at a later date.</td><td>由于空间和时间都是伪装，那么说穿越它们基本上是无意义的。这里涉及的是能量的转换，在你们层面上是人格本质的延伸，它允许感知的延伸。我以后会把这说得更清楚。</td></tr><tr><td>The transportation is apparent only.In basic terms, as far as your plane is concerned, the body does appear in a new location, but it does not travel between two points, as a vehicle might do.There is a transformation of energy from one location simultaneously to another location.</td><td>运输只是表面的。基本上，就你们层面而言，身体确实会出现在一个新的位置，但它并不是像一个交通工具那样在两个点之间移动。而是有一个能量转换，从一个位置同时到另一个位置。</td></tr><tr><td>Time as you know it, is simply ignored as an element here.It takes no time for you to journey, using the inner senses, from Elmira to New York.You are simply operating in a different dimension.</td><td>你们所知道的时间，这元素在这里根本被忽略了。对你来说，运用内在感官，从艾尔迈拉到纽约的旅程不需要时间。你只是在一个不同的维度上操作。</td></tr><tr><td>Psychological time, as I have said often, comes extremely close to the climate in which I have my existence, and which you exist in, but unconsciously.Experience with psychological time, and a continuous familiarity with it, will tell you more than words can about the basic realities of all existence.</td><td>心理时间，我常说，非常接近我的存在所处的气候，你们也存在于其中，但却是无意识的。对心理时间的体验，以及对它的不断熟悉，将比语言更能告诉你所有存在的基本实相。</td></tr><tr><td>Death, at first, feels like psychological time.There is a period when you retain the idea of camouflage time, before full freedom enters in, and a small lapse before orientation is possible.</td><td>死亡，一开始，感觉像心理时间。在完全自由进入之前，有一段时期你还保留着伪装时间的概念，在熟悉)状况之前，还有一小段空白。</td></tr><tr><td>The use of psychological time will make the experience of death much less frightening.You will already have learned to recognize the spacious present for what it is, and the conscious ego will not be so bewildered and confused by the sudden perception that is involved.</td><td>心理时间的运用会让死亡的经历不那么可怕。到时候，你们已经学会认识到什么是广阔的现在，而有意识的自我也不会因为突如其来的感知而那么困惑和迷茫。</td></tr><tr><td>Just before the experience of death, timelessness, or the spacious present, begins to be perceived.It is because the ego is tied to its past that it sees the past seemingly rise up.It has the ability to see what is coming, so to speak, but while the frightened ego is still in control it chooses to see only a portion of what is possible, and before the point of death it usually chooses to hide in the past.</td><td>就在经历死亡之前，无时间性或广阔的现在开始被感知。正是因为自我与它的过去绑在一起，所以它看到过去似乎历历在目。它有能力看到即将发生的事情，可以这么说，但是当受惊的自我仍在控制中时，它选择只看到可能理解的那部分，在死亡之前，它通常选择躲在过去。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:00.Jane was dissociated as usual.Usually it take her until second break to reach full dissociation, she said.</td><td>(10:00休息。珍解离如常。她说，通常要到第二次休息时，她才会达到完全的解离。</td></tr><tr><td>(However, something different now entered in when she began dictating again.She had been resting in our favorite chair, the Kennedy rocker.Instead of getting up and pacing again, she began dictating while still seated.Her eyes were closed, and remained so.She rocked gently back and forth, speaking in a normal voice.Since this was a departure from her usual procedure I watched her closely.I thought that if she appeared to be slipping into a deeper trance state it might be wise to interrupt the session.But at no time did I feel that this was happening.Resume at 10:03.)</td><td>(但是，当她再次开始传述时，一件不同以往的事发生了。她一直坐在我们最喜欢的甘迺迪摇椅上休息。她没有再站起来踱步，而是坐着就开始传述。双眼闭)着，而且一直是这样。她轻轻地前后摇晃着，用正常的声音说话。由于这与她一贯的做法不一样，所以我仔细观察着她。我想，要是她看起来陷入一种更深层的出神状态，那么中断课程可能是明智的。但我始终没有感觉到有这情况发生。10:03继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have said that this will be a brief session.Until you learn, and you are learning, to replenish your psychic energies, such experiences as the one you had this evening will leave you with a certain weariness.This is not necessary, but in the beginning, I am afraid it is natural.</td><td>我说过，这将是一节短课。在你学会，而且你也正在学习，补充你的灵性能量之前，像你今晚这样的经历，会让你有一定的倦意。这不是必须的，但在开始的时候，恐怕这也是很自然的。</td></tr><tr><td>You are using abilities that you have not used before, and it will take some getting used to.The extra session that we had was probably not too good of an idea from my standpoint, although for various reasons I did want to call it.However, it is not my intention to wear you out, and when I do call an unscheduled session for any reason, then I will compensate by either making the next session shorter, or according to the length of the unscheduled session, dispense with the following one.</td><td>你在使用你以前没有用过的能力，这需要一些适应。从我的立场来看，我们多出来的那节课，可能并不是一个太好的主意，虽然出于各种原因，我确实想上这么一堂课。然而，我无意让你疲于奔命，当我因为任何原因召集了一次未安排的课程时，那么我将通过缩短下一节课的时间，或者根据临时课程的时间长度，取消下节课来进行补偿。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane laughed.She was still rocking back and forth, her eyes closed, her hands crossed at her waist.)</td><td>(珍笑了。她还在前后摇晃，闭着眼睛，她的手交叉放在腰部。)</td></tr><tr><td>A note here, about Ruburt.He is in good shape.The fact that he has manuscripts out always makes him impatient, and particularly this time of year, affects his chemical balance.He is learning to control this to some extent, for which you should be grateful.I mention this merely to lessen his worries on the subject.</td><td>在此说明一下，是关于鲁柏的。他的状态很好。事实是，他有稿件出来时，总是让他不耐烦，尤其是每年的这个时候，会影响他的化学平衡。他正在学习在一定程度上控制这一点，对此，你应该心存感激。我提到这一点，只是为了减少他在这个问题上的担忧。</td></tr><tr><td>I am most pleased with your progress, Joseph, and I expect it to continue.Perhaps someday you will bring a handful of sand back from a Florida beach.Not enough to make a beach of your own, perhaps, but a handful in the middle of your living room table would be quite an achievement.</td><td>我对你的进步感到非常高兴，约瑟，我希望它能继续下去。也许有一天你会从佛罗里达州的海滩带回一把沙子。也许还不够做一个属于你自己的海滩，但在你的客厅桌子中间放上一把沙子，就已经很了不起了。</td></tr><tr><td>I am merely trying out something new for a few minutes with Ruburt, and it seems to be working well.</td><td>我只是花几分钟在和鲁柏尝试一些新的东西，而且看起来效果不错。</td></tr><tr><td>("I was wondering. "</td><td>("我在想是怎样"。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was still peacefully rocking.)</td><td>(珍还在安详地摇晃着。)</td></tr><tr><td>I anticipate an excellent and full session Wednesday.I do not on any account want to overburden you with extra notetaking, especially since your own experiments will necessitate further need for records.</td><td>我期待周三有一节出色和完整的课。我决不想让额外的笔记增加你的负担，尤其是你还有自己的经验需要记录。</td></tr><tr><td>("Was my swollen hand earlier this evening a sign that I’d sensed you?")</td><td>("今天晚上我的手肿了，是不是说明我感觉到了你？</td></tr><tr><td>Shortly after your dinner I came briefly, not sure whether or not I would even hold this session, in light of the extra one.We still have much material to be covered.However, this evening I did want to speak about your own experience, and to offer my comments and encouragement.</td><td>你们晚餐后不久，我来过一会儿，鉴于之前多了一节不定期课，我不确定今晚要不要上课。我们还有很多资料要讲。不过，今晚我确实想谈谈你自己的经验，并提出我的意见和鼓励。</td></tr><tr><td>By all means get your vitamins, incidentally, and I would suggest that you take them on a regular everyday basis.You are using, both of you, much energy in these sessions.You are learning to use other energy than your own.Nevertheless this takes time also, and the vitamins will help.</td><td>附带一提，尽管吃你们的维生素吧，我建议你们每天固定服用。你们两个在这些课里使用了很多能量。你们正在学习利用你们自己之外的其他能量。不过这也需要时间，维他命会有帮助。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again Jane laughed.She was still rocking.)</td><td>(珍又笑了。她还在晃。)</td></tr><tr><td>I must admit that I did feel somewhat guilty, imposing on you on an off night.Nevertheless gains were made, and I will let you off early this evening.</td><td>我必须承认，我确实感到有些内疚，在你们休息的晚上强制地上了一节课。不过是有收获的，今晚我会让你们早点结束。</td></tr><tr><td>The energy that you use in these sessions, and in your own experiments, need not be your own energy.You are already drawing upon other reservoirs, but this too is an ability in which you are being trained.There is an almost regeneration that will occur, and that is occurring now, to some degree.</td><td>你们在这些课和你们自己的实验所用的能量，不需要是你们自己的能量。你们已经在利用其他的能量库，但这也是你们正在接受训练的一种能力。会有一种几乎是再生的情况发生，在某种程度上，这情况正在发生。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane's eyes opened.She appeared to be fully alert.She remained seated as she ended the session.)</td><td>(珍的眼睛现在睁开了。她似乎完全清醒了。她还是坐着，结束了课程。)</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that we end the session.All in all, we will come out a little ahead, with this session and the unscheduled one.</td><td>我建议我们结束这一节课。总的来说，这节课和计划外的课，让我们稍微超前一点。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth." End at 10:23.Jane said she had been dissociated to a greater degree than ever before while in the rocker, but that it still was not a state of deep trance.She had not been worried.Her thought at the time had been that she wasn't sure how far Seth would go with the trance state.</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。10:23结束。珍说她在摇椅上时，解离程度大于以往任何时候，但这仍然不是很深的出神状态。她也没有担心。她当时的想法一直是，她不确定在这种出神状态，赛斯会做到什么程度。</td></tr><tr><td>(This material is dealt with briefly in the following 49th session.</td><td>(下面的资料将在第49节课上被简要论述到。</td></tr><tr><td>(This evening Tuesday, April 28, 1964, while trying psychological time, between 10:03 and 10:25, I had two brief but interesting experiences.</td><td>(今天晚上，星期二，1964年4月28日，在尝试心理时间时，10:03至10:25之间，我有两次短暂而有趣的经历。</td></tr><tr><td>(In the first one, after lying quietly for some time, and approaching the necessary state [close to sleep yet not asleep, but unaware of my body lying on the bed], I saw myself, I was at a public swimming pool in the summertime, although I saw no one else.I saw myself from the right side, striding purposefully along with vigorous step, carrying over my right arm a neatly folded white towel.Evidently I wore a bathing suit, but it was obscured by the towel, and I could not see its color.I did see my bare torso and lower legs.</td><td>(第一次，在静静地躺了一段时间，接近必要的状态后[接近睡，但还没有睡着，并没有意识到我的身体躺在床上]，我看到了我自己，我是在一个夏天的公共游泳池，但我并没有看到其他人。我从右侧看到我自己，迈著有力的步子有目的地走着，右臂上搭着一条折叠整齐的白毛巾。显然我穿的是泳衣，但被毛巾遮)住了，看不到它的颜色。我确实看到了我裸露的躯干和小腿。</td></tr><tr><td>(Beyond my figure I saw the typical bluegreen opaque water of the tiled swimming pool and some shining pipe work, evidently a fence or ladder.Over my head I sensed the reaching out arc of a pavilion roof, curving gracefully.I walked on what I believe to be sparkling green and white tile.</td><td>(除了我的形体之外，我还看到了贴瓷砖的游泳池中，那典型的蓝绿色不透明的水，和有些闪闪发光的管子，显然是围栏或梯子。在我头顶上方，我感觉到一座凉亭屋顶向外伸展的弧形，弧度优美。我漫步在我认为是绿白相间的亮瓷砖上。</td></tr><tr><td>(The flooring took a series of long shallow steps down, each step being perhaps two or three inches deep.As I strode along, my right heel slipped off the edge of a step, and I landed flatfooted on the next step with ajar.So vivid was this sensation that my whole body jumped, on the bed, and I was awake.And as my foot slipped and I was shaken up, I was myself, that is I was no longer watching myself.Upon awakening I thought of the Sayre swimming pool, but as far as I know the two settings would not be the same.</td><td>(地面上有一长串低低的台阶，每个台阶大概有两三英寸高。我跨步走下阶梯时，我的右脚跟从台阶的边缘滑落，一脚踏在下一个台阶上。这感觉如此逼真，以至于我整个身体跳了起来，在床上，而且醒着。正当我的脚一滑、身体一震的时候，我是我自己；也就是说，我不再看着我自己了。醒来后，我想到塞尔的游泳池，但就我所知，这两个背景并不相同。</td></tr><tr><td>(The second experience came shortly after the above.This time I was myself.I was dressed in colorful summer sport clothes and wearing a cap.Again it was a bright summer day.In my right hand I held either a sheaf of papers or a road map; I did not look at what I held.I was leaning against the end pipe, or post, of a modern, steel meshwork type of fence that reached rather high above me—several feet in fact.Before me was a very large parking lot, full of cars.I saw nobody else.</td><td>(第二个经历是在上述事件后不久。这一次，我就是我自己。我穿着五颜六色的夏季运动服，戴着帽子。同样是一个明媚的夏日。我的右手拎着一叠报纸或一张地图；我没有看我拿的是什么。我靠在一个现代不锈钢网状栅栏的尾端或柱子上，它比我高出许多，事实上有几英尺高。在我前面是一个大型停车场，停满了车。我没有看到其他人。</td></tr><tr><td>(In back of me, to my left and on the other side of the fence, was some kind of long dark building.The fence was also quite long.The scene reminded me of Clute's usedcar lot here in Elmira, but was not it.</td><td>(在我的左后方，栅栏的另一边，是某种又暗又长的建筑。栅栏也相当长。这个场景让我想起了在艾尔迈拉克鲁特的二手车行，但这不是它。</td></tr><tr><td>(As I stood learning against the post in the bright sunlight, I suddenly heard my name called out, in a highpitched, plaintive, feminine voice: "Roo-bert..." The effect was quite startling, very distinct and definite, and the first time I have had an audio experience.</td><td>"""""""(当我站在明媚的阳光下斜靠着柱子时，我突然听到有人叫我的名字，这是一个高亢、凄惨、女性的声音：""罗-伯特""效果相当惊人，非常清晰、明确，""""这是我第一次的听觉经验。""</td></tr><tr><td>(The almost forlorn wail of my name came from some distance in back of me, on my right.As soon as I heard it I snapped my head around to see who was calling me—and woke up.</td><td>(我的名字几乎是凄厉的哀号，从我身后不远处的右边传来。我一听到这个声音，就猛地转过头来，想看看是谁在叫我—然后就醒了。</td></tr><tr><td>(The voice was not Jane’s, although it was similar in range.Yet it was also higher, and somehow formal too.I do not know anyone, male or female, who calls me Robert, (least of all in that manner), nor did the voice remind me of anyone I might know, no matter how slightly.</td><td>(那不是珍的声音，虽然音域相似。可是它的音调更高，而且有点正式。我不认识任何叫我罗伯特的人，无论男女，(尤其是以这种方式)，这声音也没有让我想起任何我可能认识的人，</td></tr><tr><td>(Shirley White, in the summer of 1964, corner of Walnut & Water.She called to me from a car making a left turn off the Walnut Street bridge, by Water St. Jane & I were standing on the lawn by our apartment house.When I heard Shirley call me I had my thrilling sensation.Yet, because the setting was different I was not sure this was it, & doubted the connection.Did not ask Seth.Still not sure, Dec. 1964, but note this down to retain it.This is the only time that I know of so far, when someone has called me Robert.The manner of the call was very much like my psytime experience.</td><td>(雪莉·怀特，1964年夏天，在沃纳和沃特街的拐角。她从沃纳街桥上左转的一辆汽车内叫我，当时珍与我站在我们公寓的草坪上。当我听到雪莉叫我时，我有一种毛骨悚然的感觉。然而，因为背景不同，所以我不确定是不是就是它，并怀疑其中的关联。我没有问过赛斯。1964年12月，虽不能确定，但仍把它记录下来保存着。这是我至今所知的唯一一次，有人叫我罗伯特。叫的方式很像我心理时间的经验。</td></tr><tr><td>(Note that in first experience I saw similar location [later, in Watkins Glen,NY] but did not participate actively—that is, I did not swim.In the second, the location was different, but I heard the calling voice.Distortions account for this?)</td><td>(注意，在第一个经验中，我看到了类似的地点[后来，在纽约的沃特金斯格伦]，但并没有积极参与，也就是说，我没有游泳。第二次，地点不同，但我听到了叫喊的声音。难道这是扭曲导致的吗？)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 49</td><td>第49节催眠,思想永不消逝</td></tr><tr><td>APRIL 29, 1964 9 PM WEDNESDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964年4月29日星期三晚上9点按指示</td></tr><tr><td>(At 7:50 Jim Beckett arrived to be a witness.He brought a friend, Jim Tennant, a research technician in spectroscopic measurements and tabulating data, for Corning Glass, which is near Elmira.Both Jims are about 25 years old, both have abilities in electronics, both are ham radio operators.</td><td>(7:50，吉姆·贝克特抵达来当见证人。他还带了一位朋友吉姆·坦南特(JimTennant)，他是在艾尔迈拉附近的康宁玻璃公司从事光谱测量和数据制表的技术研究员。两个吉姆都是25岁左右，都有电子方面的技术才能，都是业余无线电操作员。</td></tr><tr><td>(At 8:00，I tried psychological time, without success.I could not reach that necessary waiting and peaceful state just preceding sleep.Jane tried at 8:30, also with no results.</td><td>(晚上8:00我尝试了心理时间，没有成功。我无法达到那种必要的等待和就在入眠前的那种宁静状态。珍在8:30尝试了，也没有结果。</td></tr><tr><td>(By 8:55 Jane was nervous as usual, though not because of the witnesses.When she began dictating her voice was quite strong and somewhat deeper, more so than usual.She maintained this good voice throughout the session so it need not be mentioned again.Her pacing was rather slow, her eyes dark as usual.)</td><td>(到8:55，珍像往常一样紧张，但是不是因为证人的原因。开始传述后，她的声音相当有力，比平常更低沉。在整个课程期间她都保持着这个良好的嗓音，因此不再提及。她踱步比较慢，眼睛漆黑如常。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am pleased that Roarck came for a regular session, and also that he brought with him a friend, who has been a friend of his, though not of mine, on countless instances.</td><td>我很高兴洛克来参加这堂定期课，并且还带了一位朋友来，虽然不是我的朋友，但这位朋友却是他无数次的朋友。</td></tr><tr><td>This relationship has gone on through three successive lives as far as Roarck and his friend is concerned.I have not known him, nor have you, Joseph.He was involved in the Inquisition period, and also like Roarck still has remnants of old rigidities.</td><td>就洛克和他朋友而言，这个关系已经连续了三世。我不认识他，你也不认识，约瑟。他曾参与过宗教法庭时期(译注：中世纪天主教审判异端的法庭)，也和洛克一样，还残留着旧有的刚硬。</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless in his case an excess, fervent nature has always been in existence, and even now his enthusiasms are extremely fervent, and although a humorous exterior personality now shows its face, nevertheless the extremely authoritative and sometimes too rigid nature holds the personality presently in bounds.</td><td>然而在他的情况下，一种过度的、狂热的本性一直存在，即使是现在，他的热情也是极度的狂热，虽然现在显露出一个幽默的外在人格，但极度的权威性和有时过于僵化的本性却把目前这个人格限制住了。</td></tr><tr><td>The bounds amount to bonds in some cases.He is given to fervent allegiances, and often should listen to the dictates of inner discipline.The cruelty which he inflicted upon others during the period of the Inquisition was inflicted with the most pure of purposes.He believed firmly that he was following the dictates of God.More cruelties have been effected by principled men than unprincipled men would ever dream.</td><td>在某些情况下，这些限制相当于束缚。往往在应该听从内在指令的时候，却沈溺在狂热的忠诚里。他在宗教法庭时代加诸于他人的残酷，是出于最纯粹的目的。他坚信自己是在遵从上帝的旨意。有原则的人所施加的残酷，比没有原则的人所能想象的还要多。</td></tr><tr><td>The personality has endeavored to right old wrongs, and has succeeded to a great degree, but at the risk of sacrificing inner spontaneity, and even at the risk of losing the very authoritative aspects of his nature, so that there is still a tendency to follow rather than to lead; simply because in the period of the Inquisition he was in a place of authority, he led; and he led men into atrocities committed in the fine name of principle and religion.For this reason, while he is still tempted to lead, he allows himself to lead only in small ways, not trusting yet the judgment which at one time betrayed him.</td><td>这个人格一直在努力纠正旧有的错误，并在很大程度上取得了成功，但却要冒着牺牲内在自发性的危险，甚至要冒着失去他本质中非常权威的那些面向，所以仍然有一种跟随而不是领导的倾向；只因为在宗教法庭时代，他处于权威的地位，他就领导了；他带领人们以教条和宗教的美名行残酷之实。出于这个原因，虽然他仍有去领导的诱惑，他只允许自己在小范围内领导，还不信任那曾经背叛他的判断力)</td></tr><tr><td>There religious interests, therefore, are repeated in the present personality, but efforts are made to tie these ideas into the world of so-called reality.The interest in extrasensory perception, the interest in science and religion, all represent efforts on his part to tie various of his older personalities together, and to learn from their mistakes.</td><td>因此，对宗教的兴趣，在现在的人格中重复出现，但努力把这些观念与所谓的现实世界联系起来。对超感知觉的兴趣，对科学和宗教的兴趣，都代表着他努力把他的各种旧人格联系在一起，并从他们的错误中学习。</td></tr><tr><td>Roarck knew him well during the period of the Inquisition, and again in an immediately past life in the Midwest of your country, as well as in one other existence.Nevertheless, I welcome your new friend to the sessions, and he is one of those of whom I have spoken earlier.</td><td>洛克在宗教法庭时代就与他非常熟，还有在你们国内中西部的前一世，以及另一世也是。无论如何，我欢迎你们的新朋友来参加课程，他是我先前提过的那些人之一。</td></tr><tr><td>I did not find it of much real purpose to give reviews during our sessions, particularly since new witnesses will come.There will have to be some method, and I leave this up to you, Joseph, some method of filling witnesses in on previous sessions. This should be taken care of in some manner.</td><td>我不认为在我们的课程期间进行复习有什么实际意义，特别是由于会有新的证人要来。必须要有某种方法，可以帮助证人补以前的课，我把这个问题留给你，约瑟，这件事应该要想个办法处理。</td></tr><tr><td>I would like to make a remark for your benefit, Joseph.The experience during psychological time, involving your own image by a body of water, was a most valid clairvoyant experience, in that you have not as yet visited this particular spot, and it was a glimpse into what you prefer to call the future.</td><td>约瑟，为了你的裨益，我有几句话要说。在心理时间的经验，涉及你自己在水边的形象，是一个最有效的千里眼经验，因为你还没有去过这个特定的地方，它就是对你们更愿意称之为未来的一个瞥见。</td></tr><tr><td>I have explained too often that time is a camouflage, to go into this now.Nevertheless you have done well, particularly this week, in your experiments, and your progress should be fairly rapid from now on.</td><td>我解释过很多次，时间是一种伪装，这我现在就不说了。不过，你们的实验做得很好，尤其是这一周，从现在开始，你们的进展应该相当迅速。</td></tr><tr><td>("Can you tell me something about my experience of seeing the young girl abusing the dog?")</td><td>("你能说说我看到那个年轻女孩虐待狗的经历吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>(See page 39.)</td><td>(See page 39.)</td></tr><tr><td>The girl was a relative of yours.The incident actually occurred in 1935.The relative now lives in your town.The dog does not.</td><td>那女孩是你的亲戚。该事件实际上发生在1935年。那位亲戚现在住在你们镇上。那条狗没有。</td></tr><tr><td>("Who was the relative?")</td><td>("那个亲戚是谁？")</td></tr><tr><td>The name of the relative is Ruth.I presume the name makes sense to you.Ruburt loves to block such personal data.However, I see that he let it come through undistorted.Bravo, Ruburt.I could hope that this would continue.</td><td>这个亲戚的名字是露丝(Ruth)。我认为这个名字对你是有意义的。鲁柏喜欢挡掉这类私人资料。但是，我看他还是让它顺利通过了。做得好，鲁柏。我希望这种情况能持续下去)</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take a break, as there is much material that I would like to cover this evening.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下，因为今天晚上有很多资料要讲。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:25.Jane was more fully dissociated than usual, for a first monologue.</td><td>(9:25休息。在第一段独白时，珍比平时更充分地解离。</td></tr><tr><td>(My confusion over the name of my cousin Ruth stemmed from the fact that when Seth referred to "your town" I thought of Sayre, PA, where I grew up, instead of Elmira, 18 miles away, where Ruth grew up.In 1935 I was 15 years old.Ruth being a few years younger, her physical dimensions at that time would closely match the young girl I drew in my pen and ink sketch of the experience.Also, the girl I saw was a blonde, and Ruth is a blonde.</td><td>(我表妹露丝的名字让我困惑，是由于当赛斯提到"你的城镇"时，我想到的是宾州塞尔，我在那里长大，而不是18英里外的艾尔迈拉，露丝长大的地方。1935年，我15岁。露丝小我几岁，她当时的身高与我在笔墨素描中所画的年轻女孩非常吻合。另外，我看见的女孩是金发，而露丝也是金发。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth stated that Jim Tennant is one of the group he expects to gather around Jane and me.Jim T. reported that this afternoon, upon being invited to attend a session by Jim B„ he felt his scalp distinctly crawl on three separate occasions; lifting up as though it would detach itself.Jim T. stated that his mother is quite clairvoyant, that often when he is ill, for instance, she will get in touch with him before he has time to inform her of his illness.</td><td>(赛斯说，吉姆·坦南特，是他期待会聚集在珍和我身边的团体成员之一。吉姆·坦南特说道，今天下午，当吉姆·贝克特邀请他出席这节课的时候。他分别有三次清清楚楚地感觉到他的头皮在爬动；擡升起来，仿佛要脱离自己。吉姆·坦南特说，他的母亲很有遥视的能力，比如，当他生病的时候，她经常会在)他还没来得及通知她的时候就和他联系。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jim T. has been a radio announcer, and we discussed ways to record the sessions, along with my taking notes.</td><td>(吉姆·坦南特是一位电台播音员，我们讨论了在我做笔记的同时，怎样把这些课程录制下来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed at 9:32.)</td><td>(珍9:32分继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your new friend can be called Mareth, Ma-re-th, which is the name most suitable for his entity.You realize that such names are translations, as indeed all of this material is a translation of realities into conceptual patterns, and from conceptual patterns into words.It is with the words, of course, that necessary distortions must occur.</td><td>你们的新朋友可以叫做马雷斯(Mareth)，Ma-re-th，这是最适合他的存有的名字。你们了解这些名字都是译名，事实上所有这些资料都是将实相转换为概念模式，再从概念模式转译成语言。而使用语言，当然，就一定会发生扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>If the material is to be understood by the ego, then it must be translated in the beginning into terms which the ego is competent to handle, unfortunately.Inner data, which will be and is being received, will be valid, vivid, and will exist beyond any doubt.We shall set up plans so that any experiences will be documented.</td><td>如果要让自我理解这份资料，很遗憾，一开始就得把它转译成自我有能力处理的术语。将要和正在接收的内在资料，将是合理又生动的，并将不容置疑的存在。我们应该拟定计划，以便将任何经验记录下来。</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless a freedom from the ego must be permitted to some extent, so that the inner self can most freely operate.I have spoken of tests and experiments that can be conducted, and which will yield physical results that will be ultimately accepted.</td><td>不过，必须允许在一定程度，有摆脱自我的自由，内在自己才能很自由地运作。我已经谈到了可以进行的测试和实验，它们产生的物理结果，最终会被接受)我还说过，所谓的太空旅行，将必然脱离它目前对载具的关注。人们将会发现，内在感官是你们这类旅行的唯一持久的方法。</td></tr><tr><td>I have also said that space travel, so-called, will of necessity deviate from its present concern with vehicles. It will be discovered that the inner senses represent your only longlasting method of such travel.</td><td>当明白了空间和时间都是伪装，以及你们的因果论是不再具有意义的连续性理论的结果时，那么你们的科学家们就会认识到，试图用伪装仪器，以及飞行器，来破译基本实相是不可能的，透过这些仪器和飞行器本身就会产生扭曲的理论，只能起到更深入探究伪装模式的作用。</td></tr><tr><td>When it is understood that space and time are both camouflages, and that your cause and effect theory is a result of a continuity theory that no longer makes sense, then your scientists will recognize the impossibility of trying to decipher basic reality with camouflage instruments, and vehicles, that of themselves produce distortive theories, and only serve to probe further into a camouflage pattern.</td><td>将会有很多实验。像我提过的催眠，将是一开始的基本工具。催眠，你知道，不是一个伪装的工具，而是一种心理工具，因此它没有伪装，也相对地没有扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>The experiments will be many.Hypnotism, as I have mentioned, will be a basic tool in the beginning. Hypnotism, you see, is not a camouflage tool, but a psychological tool which is therefore uncamouflaged, and relatively undistorted.</td><td>不过，催眠是必要的，但也只是暂时的，只是为了诱发轻度出神状态。在轻微的出神状态下，内在自己不受你们层面的伪装性束缚，而真正有意思的面向是：唯有让你自己摆脱你自己的伪装宇宙，你才能清楚看见它，了解它是什么，并且真正学会利用它为人类谋</td></tr><tr><td>Hypnotism will be necessary, however, only for a time, and only to induce the light trance state. In the light trance state, the inner self is free from the camouflage nature of your plane, and the truly humorous aspect is this: Only by freeing yourself from your own camouflage universe can you see it clearly, understand it for what it is, and actually learn to use it for mankind's best advantage.</td><td>取最大的利益。</td></tr><tr><td>When tests are conducted, and this will take a while, but when tests are conducted in laboratories, using the trance, the controlled and disciplined trance, as a tool and an instrument, then very quickly you will be able to delve beneath personal subconscious material to other layers.</td><td>当进行测试时，这需要花点时间，但当在实验室里进行测试时，利用出神，在控制和纪律之下的出神，做为工具和手段，那么很快你们就能深入到个人潜意识资料之下的其他层次。</td></tr><tr><td>We have spoken of these other layers.For the edification of our esteemed visitors, I will quickly mention them.Beneath personal subconscious material you will find data, free, dealing with racial memories which will be of great benefit to psychologists and sociologists.Beneath this you will find material that is concerned with the beginnings of the species as a whole; and beneath this, and connected to it by the emotions, you will come to the boundaries of the inner self.</td><td>我们已经说到过这些其他层次。为了让我们尊敬的客人有所启发，我就快速地的再介绍一下。在个人潜意识资料之下，你们会发现一些资讯，免费的，涉及到种族记忆，这对心理学家和社会学家都将大有助益。在这之下，你们会发现与整个物种的起源有关的资料；在此之下，透过情感与之连结，你将来到内在自己的边界。</td></tr><tr><td>When tests are conducted, the inner self can be reached without too much difficulty.The methods to be used here are already familiar to you, Joseph, and to Ruburt.</td><td>在进行测试时，内在自己可以被触及，没有太多困难。这里要使用的方法，你约瑟，和鲁伯都已经很熟悉了。</td></tr><tr><td>(For emphasis Jane knocked on the table top.All through this material she spoke with much emphasis and used many gestures.)</td><td>(为了强调，珍敲了敲桌面。所有这些资料，她说的时候都很强调，并使用了许多手势。)</td></tr><tr><td>When this material begins to tally, when under trance many of the same answers are received, when it is discovered that the knowledge of the basic universe is contained within the living individual, and when there is no doubt that the solutions given are the same, then and only then will you begin to solve the problems that are before you.</td><td>当这些资料开始趋于一致，当在恍惚之下收到许多相同的答案，当发现基本宇宙的知识就在活生生的个人之内，当毫无疑问所给出的解决方案是相同的时候，那么，也只有在那时，你们才会开始解决摆在你们面前的问题。</td></tr><tr><td>The light trance, again, is necessary only for a time, and theoretically it is not necessary at all.The only necessity here is that you permit yourself not to displace the ego, but more, to enable yourself to look within and past the ego.</td><td>轻度出神状态，再说一次，只是暂时有必要，理论上它是完全没有必要的。这里唯一的必要是，你允许自己不取代自我，而更多的是，让自己能够越过自我而向内看。</td></tr><tr><td>There are a few more points here, merely connective material, that I want to make before going further into a discussion of experiments that should, and will, be tried.</td><td>这里还有几点，仅仅是连接性的资料，我想在进一步讨论应该和将要尝试的实验之前，先说一下。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take a break; and one of these nights I will break you all up, but we shall certainly save the pieces.Perhaps between us we can all put them together again, in a most splendid fashion.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下(takeabreak)；总有一个晚上，我会把你们全部打破(breakyouallup，译注：双关语)，但我们一定会把碎片收好。也许我们两个就可以再把它们全部拼凑起来，用一种最精彩的方式。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:55. Jane was fully dissociated.Jim Beckett stated that midway through the monologue, he felt the presence of Bill Macdonnel so strongly that he expected to see Bill walk in the door.However Bill did not appear throughout the evening.It will be remembered that Jim B. and Bill were witnesses to the 47th session.That was the first time they had met, although Seth stated they had known each other in previous lives.</td><td>(9:55休息，珍完全解离。吉姆·贝克特说，在这次传述的中间，他强烈地感觉到比尔·麦克唐纳的在场，以至于他期待会看到比尔走进门来。但是比尔整个晚上都没出现。我们记得吉姆·贝克特和比尔是第47节课的证人。那是他们的第一次见面，但赛斯说他们在前几世就已经认识。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed at a slower pace at 10:05.)</td><td>(珍以较慢的节奏恢复10:05。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have explained to you how the inner self is connected to the present personality, and how the emotions at your end change through the layers of the subconscious, begin in your plane as parts of the personality, and as part of your force field, and then are transformed and become the innersense connective that connects the outer ego to the inner self.</td><td>我已经向你解释了内在自己是如何与当前人格相连接的，以及在你们这一端的情绪，如何通过层层的潜意识而变化，在你们层面开始成为人格的一部分，成作为你力场(forcefield)的一部分，然后被转换，成为内在感知(inner-sense)的连结物，连结外在自我和内在自己。</td></tr><tr><td>I have also explained how energy is transformed, and changes, adapting itself to the particular camouflage pattern of any given plane.Now in these tests you will reach the inner self.The results will be, then, valid in physical terms.The emotions are the outer extensions of the inner senses, and it is therefore through the intuitions and traveling, the traveling of the pathways of the emotions, that you will come in contact with the inner self, and therefore be able to carry back this information in the same manner.</td><td>我也解释了能量如何转换和改变，如何调整自己适应任何特定层面的特定伪装模式。现在，在这些测试中，你将触及内在自己。那么，结果将是，在物质上有效的。情绪(emotions)是内在感官的外部延伸，因此，通过直觉和旅行，情绪途径的旅行，你将接触到内在自己，因而能够以同样的方式带回这些信息。</td></tr><tr><td>Your visitors are not as yet acquainted with the inner ego, and I suggest that you fill them in.The point to remember here is that the results from the tests will be so valid that they will not be overlooked, and yet their validity will be different in quality.You remember what I have said about psychological experience.Psychological experience has no reality in space or time.</td><td>你们的访客尚不熟悉内在自我，我建议你先让他们了解一下。这里要记住的重点是，测试的结果会非常有效，它无法被忽视，然而其有效性的品质是不同的。你们还记得我说过的心理经验。心理经验在空间或时间上没有实相。</td></tr><tr><td>If you trusted only your so-called scientific method, then you would not admit that you have ever even had a psychological experience, since it takes up no space and exists independently of time.Nevertheless, no one will argue that a psychological experience has no validity.A psychological experience is so valid that it can change the course, not only of one life, but of many.</td><td>倘若你们只相信你们所谓的科学方法，你们就不会承认你们甚至曾经有过心理经验，因为它不占空间，独立于时间而存在。虽然如此，没有人会争辩说，心理经验没有有效性。一个心理经验的效力之强大，足以改变生命的方向，而且不只一生，而是很多世。</td></tr><tr><td>Therefore, the proof in our experiments will be valid in the terms that a psychological experience is valid; and more, because by its results it will make itself known.In space travel for example, you are not going to be seen flying through the air like some gray haired eagle.Your journey will simply not be through space, since space is a camouflage.</td><td>所以，我们实验中的证明，将在心理经验有效的条件下有效；此外，因为透过它的结果，它将会不证自明。比方说太空旅行，没有人会看见你像什么灰毛鹰一样在空中飞翔。你的旅程根本不会通过空间，因为空间是一种伪装。</td></tr><tr><td>When you realize this, then our energy transformation and our change of molecular structure comes into play.There is no barrier of space to be overcome, there is merely a transformation, first of all of psychic energy, and then because you are on your plane bound to many camouflage concepts, there will be a secondary reconstruction of physical image.</td><td>当你们领悟到这一点，那么我们的能量转换以及我们的分子结构变化就会上演。没有空间的障碍需要克服，有的只是转换，首先是心灵能量的转换，然后，因为你们在你们层面上被很多伪装概念所束缚，会有物质形象的二次重建。</td></tr><tr><td>In your dreams, when the conscious ego is stilled, you often and continually work this transformation, and we have gone into this problem.What we are concerned with is this reconstruction, but this reconstruction in durable enough terms so that communication can take place.</td><td>在你的梦里，当意识的自我静止时，你经常不断地进行这种转换，这个问题我们已经谈过。我们关切的是这种重新建构，但是，这种重新建构要持续够久，才能进行沟通。</td></tr><tr><td>Even in dreams, this communication has taken place, but we, we want much more.We want such a physical reconstruction of image in a purposeful manner, at a given place and time, on your plane. This is far from impossible, but it requires discipline and training, along with the freedom which more and more Ruburt is able to bring to these sessions.</td><td>即使是在梦中，也有这种沟通，但我们，我们想要更多。我们想要在你们的层面上，在一个特定的地点和时间，以有目的的方式，进行这样的物质形象的重建，这远非不可能，但它需要纪律和训练，以及鲁柏愈来愈能够为这些课带来的自由。</td></tr><tr><td>In the dream worldd, you do and perform more than you realize.Secondary personality problems that cannot be taken up by the personality in regular life, for various reasons, are worked out as you know.What you do not realize, however, is that these images that you all create, have an existence independent of your knowledge, once you have created them.</td><td>在梦世界，你所做的事情和表现比你意识到的要多。平时生活中由于各种原因无法承担的次人格问题，如你们知道的，都在这里被解决了。然而，你们没有意识到的是，你们所有人所创造的这些形象，一旦你们)创造了它们，便独立存在于你们的认知之外。</td></tr><tr><td>No thought or idea is extinguished, and they all follow the laws which I am in the process of giving you.The growth of an idea takes up no space.I have explained that the expanding universe theory contains gross error, since the universe, the real universe, is expanding; but it is expanding in terms of value fulfillment and has nothing to do with expansion in space.</td><td>没有任何思想或观念会灭绝，它们都遵循我正在给你们的法则。一个观念的成长，并不占据空间。我已经解释过，宇宙膨胀的理论包含严重的错误，因为宇宙，真正的宇宙，是在扩展，但它是在值的充盈(valuefulfillment)方面的扩展，与空间的扩展无关。</td></tr><tr><td>So do your dream images exist in the same manner, and you are as unaware of their existence as you are of your own subconscious existence.You do not know how you move across the floor.You are not conscious of each breath you take.You know that your muscles move, without your volition. You know you breathe, and in the same manner that you undertake physiological, biological and mental leaps and functions, so do you also create the reality of the dream worldd.</td><td>你们的梦影像也以同样的方式存在，而你们对它们的存在毫未察觉，就像你们不察觉对自己潜意识的存在一样。你不知道自己是如何在地面上移动。你没有意识到自己的每一次呼吸。你知道没有你的意志，你的肌肉也在运动，你知道你在呼吸，以同样的方式，你进行生理、生物和精神的跳跃和功能，你们也以同样的方式创造梦境的实相。</td></tr><tr><td>I have wanted to cover this because I can prove the existence of this dream worldd to you, and its continuity, always within the spacious present.You must understand psychological reality, psychological time, psychological experience, and the dream existence before you can learn to utilize many abilities, since in all the mentioned aspects, you use your abilities, that is your inner senses, on a subconscious level.</td><td>我之所以要讲这些，是因为我可以向你们证明这个梦世界的存在，以及它的持续性，一直都在广阔的现在。你们必须先了解心理实相、心理时间、心理经验，还有梦的存在，然后才能学会运用许多能力，因为在以上提到的所有面向中，你们都是在潜意识层次)使用你们的能力，也就是你们的内在感官。</td></tr><tr><td>Here you can get the feel of them so that you know what you are working with.You are always and constantly in the process of transforming energy from the inner senses into physical idea constructions.I want you to become acquainted with the process by which you accomplish this unknowingly, so that you can then perform the same feats with your own awareness.</td><td>这里你们可以领略一下，好知道自己在做什么。你们一直是在不断地将来自内在感官的能量转换为物质理念建构的过程中。我想让你们熟悉你们在不知不觉中完成的这一过程，这样你们就能够带着自己的觉知进行同样的壮举。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break, and if I seem to be ignoring our guests, I was never much of a party boy, although I have my moments.They are extremely welcome, and I expected them both.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下，如果我怠慢了我们的客人，是因为我向来不太会交际，虽然我也曾风光过。非常欢迎他们，我也期待他们两位的到来。</td></tr><tr><td>Now before I forget your break entirely, I suggest that you take it.</td><td>现在，在我完全忘记你们的休息时间之前，我建议你们赶紧休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:35.Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed at 10:46, still using a good strong voice.)</td><td>(10:35休息。珍解离如常。10:46恢复，依然用很有力的声音。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have gone into the reasons behind these sessions, and they can be read.We have a delicate balance here, and in the delicate balance itself lies the outgrowth and release of energy.I have mentioned earlier that in a dream experience, as far as the senses are concerned you may visit a particular location, experience a certain time duration; and yet the location does not exist and cannot be found in your space, and though you experience, say, five hours time in your dream, this perhaps takes up merely a flash of clock time, and the physical body does not age during the psychological dream experience in any proportion to the actual psychological reality involved.You are free of space, and to a large degree of time, in the sleeping state, because you are not using your energies to transform ideas into durable physical camouflage patterns.</td><td>我已经谈过上这些课背后的原因，可以阅读一下。我们这里有一个微妙的平衡，而在这个微妙的平衡中本身就有能量的产生和释放。我先前说过，在梦境的经历中，就感官而言，你可能会造访一个特定的地点，经历一段时间长度；然而该地点并不存在，在你们的空间里也找不到，虽然你在梦里经历了，比如说，五)个小时，但它可能只占用钟表时间的一瞬间，在心理梦境体验中，身体的衰老与涉及的心理实相并不成正比。在睡眠状态中，你不受空间束缚，而且很大程度也不受时间限制，因为你并没有用你的能量把理念转换成持久的物质伪装模式)</td></tr><tr><td>You do transform ideas into image patterns, but they do not have durability or continuity on your plane.They do however, possess durability and continuity on another plane with which you are subconsciously familiar.These images are as independent of your conscious control as the inner workings of your own physical body are beyond your conscious control.</td><td>你确实在把理念转换成图像模式，但它们在你们层面上不具持久性或连续性。然而，它们在你潜意识熟悉的另一个层面上，却具有持久性和连续性。这些影象是独立于你的意识控制的，就像你自己身体的内部运作不受你的意识控制一样。</td></tr><tr><td>These images continue to work out problems that you have set for them, in the same manner that you work out problems as your present personality in one incarnation after another.These dream images also have their own free will, within limits.I have explained the reality behind all art.I have explained that the energy contained therein is regenerating, and although held within certain limits is constantly active.The same applies to the dream worldd, and in

apply.</td><td>这些影像在持续地解决你为他们设定的问题，就像你作为你当前的人格，在一个又一个的转世中解决问题一样。这些梦影像在有限范围内，也有它们自己的自由意志。我解释过所有艺术背后的实相。我解释过其中所包含的能量是再生的，虽然保持在一定的限度内，但却不断地活跃着。这同样适用于梦世界，也适用于我们的实验。</td></tr><tr><td>You will be merely doing what you have been doing all along, but with the aid of the ego you will be able to prove the extent of your achievement.If everyone on your plane were suddenly to believe that the physical

out to achieve can in fact be achieved.</td><td>你们只要做你们一直以来在做的事情就行了，但借着自我的帮助，你们将能够证明你们成就的程度。如果在你们层面上的每一个人，都突然相信物质世界将在某个特定的时间结束，那么，它就会结束，你们就只是停止你们的理念建构而已。因此，在我们的实验中，我们将不得不从一个坚定的信念开始，相信我们设定的目标一定可以达成。</td></tr><tr><td>This in many

proofs.</td><td>在很多情况下，这会让很多人反感，但所有的物质建构都是能量的转换，先体现为理念，再建构成物质实相。没有理念，你们就没有物质实相，而且没有我们的目标是可能的这个信念，就不会有任何成就。然而，所取得的成就，将提供其自身的物质证明。</td></tr><tr><td>I have begun to go into the laws of the universe of

involves the setting up of new fields.This is oftentimes the result of value fulfillment, in which case all the given possibilities are bound to emerge, but each emergence is in the truest sense a creation.</td><td>内在宇宙的第五条法则是创造，我告诉过你们。再一次，就重要性来说，这并不一定排名第五。我只是用最简单的方式给你们讲讲这些法则)这种创造不仅涉及到能量单位和能量场域，从一个形式变换到另一个形式的戏法，也牵涉到新场域的建立。这往往是值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的结果，在这种情况下，所有给定的可能性都必然会浮现，但每一个浮现，在最真实的意义上，都是一种创造。</td></tr><tr><td>Creation occurs, again, most often through value fulfillment, which exists in a dimension having nothing to do with your space and time; and in the deepest sense creation as a whole, originally, if you’ll excuse the term, had nothing to do with either your space or your time, and the so-called birth of your known outer universe came long after in the story of creation and value fulfillment.</td><td>创造的发生，又是最常透过值的充盈(valuefulfillment)，它存在于一个与你们的空间和时间无关的维度；而就最深的意义而言，如果你不介意这样说法的话，创造，作为一个整体，从一开始就和你们的空间和时间没有任何关系，而且你们所谓的外宇宙的诞生，是在创造的故事和值的充盈(valuefulfillment)很久以后才出现的事。</td></tr><tr><td>When your scientists finally decipher the physical realities behind the birth of your known universe, they will only discover that this was an exterior manifestation of a vital psychic reality that existed long before.Creation almost always exists hand in hand with value fulfillment, and by the time that any physical construction appears within your plane, it has already been in existence.An idea on your plane gives birth to physical constructions, but the idea itself is merely a translation of another reality, which gave birth to it.</td><td>等你们的科学家最终破译出，已知宇宙诞生背后的物质实相时，他们只会发现，这是很久以前就存在的一个充满活力的灵性实相的外在显现。创造几乎总是与值的充盈(valuefulfillment)携手并存，等到任何物质建构出现在你们的层面时，它已经存在了。在你们的层面上，理念孕育了物质建构，但这个理念本身只是另一个实相的转译，理念由之而来。</td></tr><tr><td>Value fulfillment is very much like creation, and yet there is a difference, and creation exists first, if we must speak in terms of continuity, and for you we must.There is much here that almost can be given to you only through conceptual patterns, and again this difficulty arises in words strung out one before the other.</td><td>值的充盈(valuefulfillment)和创造非常相像，但还是有区别，创造先存在，如果我们一定要从连续性的角度来说的话，而为了你们，我们非这样说不可。这里有太多东西只能透过概念模式传达给你们，我说过，在一个字一个字串连起来的语言中，就会出现这种困难。</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless there is within the inner vitality and psychic value of the universe, constant creation, by which I mean the addition of something unique and new, and something that has not existed before.This creation arises from the vitality of the inner universe itself, and this vitality continually renews itself.</td><td>然而，在宇宙的内在生命力和灵性价值中，存在着不断的创造，我的意思是指增加一些独特的、崭新的东西，以前不存在的东西。这个创造升起于内在宇宙本身的生命力，而这生命力不断地自我更新。</td></tr><tr><td>Not only does it renew itself, but it generates more of itself.There is not as you may think some definite, finite amount of energy, from which all things must be created.There is instead, truly, an infinite amount of energy, and of this I am certain.Do not ask me, as yet, where this infinite amount of energy comes from.For one thing, I do not think in terms of cause and effect, and energy does not have a source in the terms with which you are familiar.</td><td>它不但自己更新自己，而且产生更多的它自己。并不像你们所想的那样，有一些明确的、有限的能量，万物一定是从中创造出来。相反，确实有无限的能量，这一点我很肯定。先不要问我，这无限量的能量是从哪里来的。首先，我不从因果的角度去思考，而能量也没有你们所熟悉的来源。</td></tr><tr><td>Creation, therefore, constantly continues, and not always along the lines of old patterns, but by means of completely different patterns.And another small but interesting point: On your own plane, there is a subconscious storehouse of knowledge, whereby it is known in a condensed fashion, by all molecules and atoms, exactly which variant or evolutionary attempts have been made, with what results—and always with an eye out, so to speak, for circumstances that might fit forms once adopted with failure, or to attempt other forms for which present circumstances may not be right.I have said that, first of all, molecules and atoms and even smaller particles, have a condensed consciousness.</td><td>所以，创造，不断地在继续，而且并不总是沿着旧的模式，而是通过完全不同的模式。还有一个虽小但有趣的重点：在你们自己的层面上，有一个潜意识的知)识库，以浓缩的形式为所有的分子和原子所得知，到底做了哪些变异或演化的尝试，结果是什么——可以说，始终关注那些，曾经失败而现在可能适合的形式，或因目前情况可能不合适而试图尝试其他形式。我说过，首先，分子和原子，甚至更小的粒子，都有一个浓缩的意识。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break, and we will go into this more deeply.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下，我们将更深入的探讨这个问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:28.Jane was more fully dissociated than usual for a first monologue.Since this material was so interesting we decided to wait and see if Seth would take up our own personal experiences with psychological time later in this session.Jane resumed in the same lowkey manner at 9:39.)</td><td>(9:28休息。珍比往常的第一次独白，更充分地解离了。由于这个资料非常有趣，我们决定等着，看赛斯是否会在这节课的稍后，谈论我们自己的个人心理时间经验。珍用同样低沉的声音在9:39恢复。)</td></tr><tr><td>The atoms and molecules that make up all physical cells are not basically bound by your time.They act within the framework of your time, but the condensed knowledge that they contain carries with it its own peculiar and unique consciousness, that is not bound by your physical laws.</td><td>构成所有物质细胞的原子和分子，基本上不受你们时间的约束。它们在你们的时间框架内行动，但它们所带有的浓缩知识，却带着它自己的奇特且独特的意识，不受限于你们的物理法则。</td></tr><tr><td>Chemicals themselves will simply not give rise to consciousness or to life.Your scientists will simply have to face the facts that consciousness comes first, and evolves its own form.But this is, and involves, individuality, and also interdependence.The physical body that you imagine consists of some sort of separate consciousness, controlling a framework of completely unconscious parts, is quite farfetched.</td><td>化学物(Chemicals)本身，根本不会产生意识或生命。你们的科学家将不得不面对这样一个事实:意识先行，并演化出自己的形态。但这是，且涉及个体性，也涉及到相互依赖性。你想象肉身形体由某种分开的意识构成，控制着一个完全无意识部分的架构，这是非常牵强的。</td></tr><tr><td>All the cells in the body are individual, and have a separate consciousness.There are certainly gradations here, but the fact remains that every cell is a conscious cell.There is conscious cooperation between the cells in all the organs, and between all the organs themselves.</td><td>身体内的所有细胞都是独立个体，拥有各自的意识。这里固然有等级之分，但每一个细胞都是有意识的细胞，这个事实不会改变。在所有器官内的细胞之间，以及在所有器官本身之间，都有着一种有意识的合作。</td></tr><tr><td>Now at various times you have questioned what the entity actually was, and wondered how fragments, or fragment personalities, could ever become entities, if they ever did.</td><td>好，你们几次问存有到底是什么，并想知道片段或人格片段究竟如何成为存有的，要是它们真的有的话。</td></tr><tr><td>Here in a simple manner is a case in point.The molecules and atoms and even smaller particles, all contain their separate consciousness.They form into cells.Now, although the cells maintain individuality and do not lose any of their abilities, in this formation into cells there is actually a pooling of individual consciousness of atoms and molecules into, and to form, an individual cellular consciousness.Here the consciousness of each individual molecule or atom, by this psychic gestalt, gains immeasurably.The combination of individual consciousness into a combination forms a new, enlarged, more powerful cellular consciousness that is capable of much more experience and fulfillment than would be possible for the isolated atom or molecule.</td><td>这里简单来说就有一个这样的例子。分子和原子，甚至更小的粒子，都含有它们各自的意识。它们形成细胞。现在，虽然细胞保持着个体性，并没有失去任何能力，在这个形成细胞的过程中，实际上是将原子和分子的个体意识汇集到一起，并形成一个个体细胞意识。在这里，每一个个体分子或原子的意识，透过这种灵性的完形(psychicgestalt)，得到不可估量的益处。个体意识合并成的这个组合，形成一个新的、扩大的、更强有力的细胞意识，它能够比孤立的原子或分子有更多的经验和盈满(fulfillment)。</td></tr><tr><td>Now we carry this even further, as you most probably suspected.You end up with organs composed of literally unnumbered individual cells, in which case the same combination with its resulting benefits for the individual, also results in the formation of a larger consciousness.</td><td>好，我们更进一步来看，正如你很可能猜想的那样。你最终的器官是由无数个体细胞组成的，在这种情况下，这个对个体有好处的相同组合，也会形成一个更大的意识。</td></tr><tr><td>This goes on ad infinitum, and yet even the lowest particle retains its own individuality, and is not stripped of any ability.Indeed, its ability is multiplied a million fold.The cooperative nature of the physical body could be no mere result of your chemicals, and chemical reactions.</td><td>这种情况一直持续，无止尽，然而即使最低的粒子，都保有它自己的个体性，并没有被剥夺任何能力。事实上，它的能力增长了百万倍。这种身体合作的本质，不可能仅是你们的化学物和化学反应造成的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>The consciousness forms its own materialization.The physical body is truly a more wondrous phenomenon than is supposed, but here I hope I do not push you too far, for this combination of consciousness continues, and its results can be seen in the consciousness of the physical brain.</td><td>意识形成它自己的物质化。肉体躯体真的是一个比想像中更奇妙的现象，但是这里，我希望我没有把你们逼得太紧，因为这种意识的组合还在继续，其结果可以在肉体大脑的意识中看到。</td></tr><tr><td>You will note that I said brain rather than mind.All of this will show itself to you in its truly logical perfection, in time, and much of this will be important in many seemingly diverse fields.</td><td>你们会注意到，我说的是大脑，而不是心智。假以时日，所有这一切都会向你们展示其真正的逻辑完美性，其中的大部分在很多看似不同的领域都将是重要的。</td></tr><tr><td>Psychosomatic medicine is in its infancy, but in this material, and in some future material along these lines, there will be found much that will apply.When the overall consciousness, for example, makes the decision to bring about the destruction or near destruction of a portion of the body, permission is asked for, and received or not received.This may seem a far cry from a discussion of entities.Nevertheless I am tying many subjects together for your edification.</td><td>身心医学正处于起步阶段，但是在这份资料，以及未来沿着这方面的资料当中，将会发现很多资料都适用。例如，当整体意识做出决定，使身体的一部分毁坏或接近毁坏时，就会要求得到许可，并得到或得不到许可。这似乎与讨论存有相去甚远。然而，我把许多主题绑在了一起，是为了启发你们。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take your break.I had some indecision, myself, as to whether or not to discuss with you matters dealing with any witnesses that might want to sit in on our sessions, and still may do so.Nevertheless at this point you seem to be holding your own.By all means take your break, and if it seems that I am shoving a lot at you this evening, it is only because I want to make the best of the time that we have.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。我自己有些犹豫，不确定要不要和你们讨论，有人可能想参加我们的课做见证的事，但还是可能这么做。不过目前来看，你们似乎在坚持自己的主张。尽管休息吧，如果今天晚上我似乎给你们塞了很多东西，那只是因为我想充分利用我们的时间。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:02.Jane was fully dissociated; she remembered very little of the material she had just delivered.</td><td>(10:02休息。珍完全解离；她对刚刚传讯的资料只记得一点点。</td></tr><tr><td>(Last Saturday Jane received several brief flashes from Seth; we have been concerned lately with the best way to handle the problem of witnesses—that is, to familiarize potential witnesses with the material, and at the same time keep our sense of privacy, and also maintain control of the sessions.Jane rather angrily cut Seth off, feeling this is a problem we must handle ourselves.</td><td>(上周六，珍从赛斯那里收到几次短短的闪讯；我们最近一直在关注处理证人问题的最佳方式，也就是，让可能的见证人熟悉这份资料，同时保有我们自己的隐私感，并保持对课的主控权。珍很生气地挡住赛斯，觉得这是我们必须自己处理的问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(One idea we think has promise is that witnesses attending the Wednesday sessions—we decided to keep Monday sessions private so that we could relax—first read the material in another room while the session itself is going on.Then when they have familiarized themselves with the material they can sit in on the sessions and understand what is going on.But during this reading witnesses could take notes, etc., or approach the material in any way they saw fit.We keep but one copy on hand, so cannot let the material off the premises.</td><td>(我们认为一个可能的办法是：让见证人参加周三的课程，我们决定保留星期一的私人课，以便我们可以放松——当课程进行时，见证人可以先在另一个房间读这份资料。然后，当他们与资料熟悉后，就可以来听课，并了解状况。但在阅读资料期间，证人可以做笔记等，或是他们觉得哪种方式适合，就用哪种方式接触这份资料。我们手头只保留一份抄本，所以不能让资料离开住所。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in her quiet manner at 10:14.)</td><td>(珍安静地恢复10:14。)</td></tr><tr><td>It would seem, therefore, that what you call consciousness might be the result of this combination.That is, it would seem that self-consciousness was the result of this combination.Each cell, however, has its own consciousness, and when I speak of consciousness as being an attribute of cellular life, I speak only for convenience, since actually cellular life is an attribute of consciousness.</td><td>因此，你们所说的意识，似乎可能是这种组合的结果。也就是说，自身意识(self-consciousness)似乎是这种组合的结果。然而，每个细胞都有它自己的意识，当我把意识说成是细胞生命的一个属性时，我只)是为了方便，因为实际上细胞生命是意识的一个属性。</td></tr><tr><td>The physical body is therefore an attribute of consciousness.The atoms and molecules possess a self-consciousness to some degree, as well as a generalized consciousness.The self awareness of a human being is partially composed of the combination of self aware individual atoms and molecules that compose it.The generalized consciousness which you call the subconscious, is composed of the combination of generalized consciousness from the individual cells and molecules, but now we come down to the source of the self aware conscious individual behind or within each molecule.Where did it come from to begin with?</td><td>因此，肉身形体是意识的一种属性。原子与分子拥有一定程度的自身意识，同时也拥有广泛性的意识。(generalizedconsciousness)。人类的自觉(selfawareness)，部分是由自觉的个别原子与分子组合而成。你们称之为潜意识的这个广泛性的意识，则是由个别细胞与分子的广泛意识组合而成，但现在我们来看看，每个分子背后或内部那自觉的意识个体的来源。它源自于哪里呢？</td></tr><tr><td>It is of course from the inner universe.This becomes extremely difficult to explain until you learn to feel conceptual patterns directly.I will try to make it as simple as possible, and hope that I am not giving you material before you can grasp it.</td><td>它当然来自内在宇宙。在你们学会直接感觉概念模式之前，要解释这一点极端困难。我会尽量把它简单化，我并且希望，在你们能掌握它之前，先不要提供资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane’s delivery became quite slow and measured.)</td><td>(现在珍的传述变得相当缓慢和谨慎。)</td></tr><tr><td>The energy personality who desires to be materialized upon your plane, himself becomes part of this plane through the use of the inner senses.Through a process of diffusion—and this incidentally is our ninth inner sense—the energy personality first diffuses himself into many parts.Since entry into this plane, as a member of this plane, cannot be made in any other manner, it must be made in the simplest terms and be built up on your plane, your sperm being of course an entry in this respect.</td><td>渴望在你们层面上物质化的能量人格，他自己通过使用内在感官成为这个层面的一部分。通过一个扩散)(diffusion)的过程——顺便说一下，这就是我们的第九内在感官——能量人格首先把自己扩散成许多部分。因为进入这个层面成为这个层面的成员，用其他方式是做不到的，必须用最简单的方式，在你们的层面上建立起来，你们的精子(sperm)当然是这方面的一个入口。</td></tr><tr><td>The energy of the personality must then be recombined and brought together, as is done in the manner which I have specified.The inner sense of disentanglement, which I have mentioned briefly in the past, represents almost an opposing movement to the initial diffusion, and must be carried out to achieve any independence from your plane.</td><td>然后，人格的能量必须重新组合和汇聚，用那我已经具体说明过的方式。脱离纠结的内在感官，以前我简略提过，代表一个几乎和最初的扩散相反的行动，必须进行这种行动，才能从你们的层面成就任何独立性。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break and hope you are following me, and I will try to get to other matters that concern you later in the discussion.But I wanted to carry this thought as far as I could this evening.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下，希望你能听懂我的话，稍后在讨论中我会设法谈到你们的事。但我想在今天晚上尽可能地把这个想法说出来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:30.Jane was now fully dissociated, she said, more so than usual.During this last material, she

10:40.)</td><td>(10:30休息。珍现在已经完全解离了，她说，比平时更解离了。在最后的这个资料中，她感觉到赛斯试着把这个概念拆解成我们能够理解的说法。她也觉得，有时无法将概念分解成文字。恢复10:40。)</td></tr><tr><td>Our next rule, or law, of the inner universe is of course consciousness.Everything that exists on any plane and under any circumstances contains consciousness, condensed knowledge, and even self awareness to some

of energy has within it the capacity to take on any pattern or to form an infinite number of energy fields, each one giving forth a truly infinite variety of

while.</td><td>你知道，就先天能力而言，手臂上的细胞或原子一样可以形成耳朵。这是一个非常简单的例子。我相信我今晚给你们的资料，够让你们忙一阵子了。</td></tr><tr><td>While it might sound impossible to you, this generalized molecular consciousness, which you would call subconscious, contains within it, in condensed genetic fashion, all knowledge of the inner workings of the universe, this knowledge being acted upon and instantly accessible when it is needed.</td><td>虽然在你们听来也许不可能，但这种广泛性的分子意识(generalizedmolecularconsciousness)，你们会称之)为潜意识，在它自己之内，以浓缩的基因方式，包含了所有关于宇宙内部运作的知识，这些知识在需要的时候会被激活起来，而且立即可得。</td></tr><tr><td>Your personal egotistical awareness has to do with your own camouflage universe, and with manipulation within it.Nevertheless, the condensed codelike comprehension of what I prefer to call the mental genes is at all times available, though not necessarily to the egotistic "I am."</td><td>你们个人自我本位的认识和你们自己的伪装宇宙有关，也与其内的操纵有关联。然而，对于我更愿意称之为精神基因的这种浓缩密码式的理解力，在任何时候都是可供使用的，但对自我本位的"我是"(Iam)则不一定。</td></tr><tr><td>When you realize that you are much more than the egotistical "I am," and that your true personality contains a much larger and really more powerful inner ego, then this relative inavailability of inner comprehension to the outer ego will not annoy you.</td><td>当你省悟到，你远比自我本位的"我是"大得多，你真正的人格包含了一个更大的、真正更强大的内在自我，那么对外在自我相对来说不可得的内在理解力，将不会再困扰你们。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, you will see that the inner ego of which we have spoken many times is the projector of energy upon your plane.The inner ego, representing the basic personality, through diffusion makes a materialization of itself and enters your plane.</td><td>现在，你将会明白，我们谈过很多次的内在自我，是把能量投射到你们层面的投射者。代表基本人格的内在自我，通过扩散(diffusion)使其自身具体化并进入你们的层面。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner ego therefore is your counterpart.It breaks energy down into simple components, but it must still operate within the given laws of the inner universe.It therefore forms the separate molecules and atoms that will compose the individual.Its own knowledge is put into condensed form, and the molecules are therefore able to combine and recombine, according to the material properties inherent in your universe.</td><td>所以内在自我是你的对等物(counterpart)。它把能量分解成简单的成分，但它仍然得在内在宇宙既有的法则之内运作。于是它形成将构成个体的个别分子和原子。它本身的知识进入了浓缩的形式，因此，分子能够根据你们宇宙固有的物质属性进行结合与再结)合。</td></tr><tr><td>You will see why this is an important point when you reread this material.You will see why, although the conscious human being may seem to be the result of this combination and recombination, he is, nevertheless, more than that result.He is a particular personality formed purposely, and not in a random fashion, the inner ego creating a replica of itself to function within a definite, peculiar set of circumstances.This is extremely important.</td><td>当你重读这些资料时，你会明白为什么这是一个重点。你们会明白，虽然有意识的人类似乎是这种组合与重新组合的结果，然而，他不仅仅是那个结果而已。他是一个有目的形成的特有人格，不是随机的组合，内在自我创造它自己的一个复制品，好在一连串明确特定的状况中运作。这一点极为重要。</td></tr><tr><td>The whole is more than the sum of its parts, but this is because you do not see the whole.The whole is never apparent in your universe.There is so much that you do not know, and so much to be filled in merely in this sort of

cooperation existing between the atoms and molecules that make up the cells and organs.</td><td>我在上一次课程上谈到了身体细胞之间的合作，以及构成细胞和器官的原子和分子之间的合作。</td></tr><tr><td>There is also a mechanism within the subconscious that allows for the materialization or projection of idea or inner vitality into physical construction.This capacity is inherent even in the atom and molecule and smaller particles.</td><td>在潜意识中也有一种机制，可以将观念想法或内在活力具体化或投射到物质结构中。这种能力甚至在原子)和分子以及更小的粒子中也是固有的。</td></tr><tr><td>You will remember that we said that atoms and molecules contained consciousness, a generalized

degree.</td><td>你会记得我们说过，原子和分子中含有意识，首先它是一种广泛性的意识，在其内，资料悬浮在浓缩的精神基因代码中，也有某种有限程度上的自身意识。</td></tr><tr><td>The capacity and mechanism necessary to project idea into physical matter is, therefore, present in the individual atom and molecule.I mentioned how the atoms and molecules combine to form cells, while each individual atom and molecule does not give up its own uniqueness, but forms rather a gestalt, so that a cell is indeed a psychic gestalt given physical construction through the capacity that exists within each individual component.</td><td>因此，将想法观念投射到实体物质中所需要的能力和机制，是存在于个别的原子和分子中的。我提到过原子和分子是如何结合起来形成细胞的，而每一个单独的原子和分子并没有舍弃自己的独特性，而是形成了一种完形(gestalt)，因此，一个细胞的确就是一个灵性完形，透过存在于每一个单独成分中的能力而被赋予了物质建构的灵性完形。</td></tr><tr><td>The ability to project idea or energy into physical construction is, therefore, generalized throughout the whole physical human body, and throughout the bodies of any living thing.This capacity, being a part of the generalized consciousness, or what you would call the subconsciousness, therefore performs its function without egotistical awareness or comprehension.</td><td>因此，将理念或能量投射到物质结构中的能力，遍及在整个人类身体以及任何生灵中。这种能力是广泛性意识的一部分，或者你们所说的潜意识，因此，它不需要自我本位的觉察或理解就能发挥其功能。</td></tr><tr><td>I have mentioned also that the cells in an arm could just as well have been formed into the cells of another limb or portion of the body.Here it is the purpose of this mental genetic code system to maintain such purpose and data.</td><td>我也曾提到，手臂上的细胞也同样可以形成另一个肢体或身体部位的细胞。在这里，这个精神基因代码系)统的目的，就是为了维持这样的目的和信息。</td></tr><tr><td>There is a difference between the physical chromosome pattern, and the mental gene code, in that the chromosomes carry translated inner instructions in condensed physical form, for the physical cells to follow.</td><td>物质的染色体模式，和精神基因代码是有区别的，染色体以浓缩的物质形式携带着转译过的内在指令，供物质细胞遵循。</td></tr><tr><td>However, the mental system that parallels the chromosome system carries in condensed form within the atoms generalized consciousness, data that has been transmitted to it by the entity.That is, before entry into your plane, the main characteristics of a personality have already been determined by the personality itself.</td><td>然而，与染色体系统平行的精神系统，在原子的广泛性意识内，以浓缩的形式携带着存有传递给它的信息。也就是说，在进入你们层面之前，人格的主要特征，已经被人格本身所决定。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner ego knows what it is about.This inner data is transmitted through the mental genetic system by way of the generalized molecular consciousness to the chromosome system, and the chromosome system then translates data into a physical code for the cells to follow.You will find this fits in with the material from our previous session.</td><td>内在的自我知道自己是什么。这份内在资讯，通过精神基因系统，以广泛性的分子意识传递到染色体系统，然后，染色体系统再把信息转译成物质代码，让细胞遵循。你会发现这与我们上一节的资料相吻合。</td></tr><tr><td>As far as Ruburt is concerned, he did correctly receive a short message recently from me, and I will go into this now.</td><td>对于鲁柏而言，他最近确实正确地收到了我发来的短讯，我现在来谈谈这件事。</td></tr><tr><td>(Yesterday Jane told me of the message she thought she had received from Seth.In it Seth compared our idea of space travel to traveling from the basement of a building to the top floor; and for a building he used as an example the ancient Tower of Babel.)</td><td>(昨天珍告诉我，她觉得她从赛斯那里收到了这个讯息。在讯息中，赛斯把我们的太空旅行的想法比喻为，从一栋建筑物的地下室到顶楼的旅程；至于建筑物，他以古代的巴别塔为例。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your idea of space travel is indeed as ridiculous as trying to build a huge, tall structure many stories high, and considering this building as a space vehicle.Buildings may be used for many things; as space vehicles you will admit they would be hilarious.For one thing they are attached to your earth.For another, traveling from the basement up to some sixtieth story hardly would bring you any closer in any real manner to the stars.</td><td>你们的太空旅行的想法真的是荒谬，就像试图建造一个巨大、高耸、有很多楼层的建筑，再把这个建筑物当成一个空间飞行器。建筑物可以有很多用途；但当成空间飞行器，那你也会承认，这太滑稽了。首先，它们是附着在你们的地球上。另外，从地下室上到某个六十层楼，根本不会让你们真的更接近星辰。</td></tr><tr><td>Through Ruburt’s subconscious I picked up the old legend of the Tower of Babel, and yet this is precisely what you are attempting now in space travel.You almost hope, to continue the analogy, that you could construct a building high enough to reach the stars.</td><td>透过鲁柏的潜意识，我捡到了巴别塔的古老传说，而这正是你们目前正在尝试的太空旅行。你们几乎是希望，继续用同一个比喻，希望能够建一栋高到可以碰到星辰的建筑物。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, although your space vehicles are not as apparently connected to the ground, they are indeed connected to the ground of your camouflage patterns in a most meaningful manner, since they are themselves camouflage.Later I want to tie this in with some other material, and with some of your recent experiences.</td><td>现在，尽管你们的太空载具，表面上不是与地面相连，但它们却以最有意义的方式与你们的伪装模式的地面相连，因为它们本身就是伪装。稍后我要把它和其他资料，以及你们最近的经验结合在一起讨论。</td></tr><tr><td>I will have more to say along these lines, but suggest your first break.I also will make some comments on witnesses in general, which you may find helpful.And my greetings, incidentally, to your guest.</td><td>我在这方面还有许多话要说，但我建议你们先休息一下。我对见证人也有些意见要说，也许对你们会有帮助。还有，顺便替我问候你们的客人。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27.Jane was fully dissociated—again, more so than usual for a first monologue.She resumed dictation in her rather sedate manner at 9:30.)</td><td>(9:27休息。珍完全地解离，再次地，比通常第一段传述后的解离，更完全。9:30，她以颇为沉稳的声音继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>I also mentioned that chemicals alone, in whatever form and with whatever mixtures, will not give you consciousness.The fact is that this statement that I have just given you is true and false, in that chemicals alone will give you consciousness, simply because we know now that every molecule exists on your plane is there as the physical materialization of conscious energy.</td><td>我也提过，单单是化学物，不管是以什么形式，不论混合什么，都不会给你们带来意识。事实上，我刚才说的这句话是真的，也是假的，单单是化学物质就会给你意识，只因为我们现在知道，存在你们层面上的每个分子，都是意识能量的物质具体化。</td></tr><tr><td>When I say that chemicals alone will not give you consciousness, I am speaking of the theory held that physical matter, chemicals and atoms, that were inert and lifeless, suddenly through some metamorphosis attained the conscious state through an evolutionary development.</td><td>当我说单单是化学物不会给你们意识，我说的是这样一个理论：那些原本是惰性的、无生命的自然物质，化学物和原子，突然通过某种蜕变，经过了演化的发展，而达到了有意识的状态。</td></tr><tr><td>The consciousness always exists before the physical materialization.The God concept, of course, originated from mankind’s innate knowledge that consciousness precedes physical construction.</td><td>意识永远存在于物质具体化之前。上帝的概念，当然，源自于人类的内在知识，即：意识先于物质建构。</td></tr><tr><td>When the physical origin of your universe is finally discovered, your scientists will be no better off than they are now.They will immediately be up against the problem that above all others they have avoided for so long, that of the origin behind the origin.The simple fact needs restating.The physical universe, and everything in it, is the result of consciousness.It did not evolve consciousness.To the contrary, consciousness not only created the physical universe, but continues to do so.</td><td>当你们宇宙的物质起源最终被发现时，你们的科学家也不会比现在更好。他们将立刻面临他们回避已久的那个首要问题：源头背后的源头。这个简单的事实需要重申一次。物质宇宙，以及其中的一切，都是意识的结果。它并没有演化出意识。相反，意识不仅创造了物质宇宙，而且还在继续创造。</td></tr><tr><td>We will, here, avoid a discussion in depth of the God concept.From the material that you have so far you understand, I hope, that this constant creation of the physical universe is carried on by each individual in it, on a subconscious level, through the use of mechanisms which I have at least partially explained.</td><td>在此，我们将避免深入讨论上帝的概念。我希望你们从迄今为止所掌握的资料中了解到，物质宇宙的这种持续创造，是由在它之内的每一个个体，在潜意识层次上，使用我至少已经部分解释过的种种机制进行的。</td></tr><tr><td>Cooperation is always a vibrant and necessary law, and you may add cooperation to our list of laws governing the inner universe.</td><td>合作永远是鲜活又必要的法则，你们可以把合作加在我们统辖内在宇宙法则的列表中(*译注:内在宇宙第九条基本法则)。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, this constant creation of the physical universe is not maintained through some localized subconscious that exists somewhere between two ears, behind the forehead.The individual subconscious, as I have explained, is the result of a psychic pooling of resources and abilities.It is a gestalt, maintained and formed by the cooperating, generalized consciousness of each atom and molecule of which the physical body is composed.</td><td>现在，这种物质宇宙的持续创造，并不是通过存在于两耳之间、额头之后的某个局部潜意识来维持的。我)解释过，个人的潜意识是资源和能力灵性汇聚的结果。它是一个完形，由构成身体的每一个原子与分子的合作、广泛性的意识所维持和形成。</td></tr><tr><td>Each individual atom within its generalized consciousness has the capacity, in some degree, to construct its portion of energy into physical construction.It is extremely important that you understand this fact, and realize that the individual cells, for example, lose no individuality in this process, and gain immeasurably, the whole physical structure of the body being the result of this cooperation of cells which are themselves the result of the cooperation of atoms and molecules.</td><td>每一个个体原子，在其广泛性的的意识中，都有能力在一定程度上，把它的那部分能量建构成物质结构。极为重要的是，你们要明白这个事实，要认识到，例如单个细胞在这个过程中并没有失去个体性，而是获得了不可估量的好处，整个身体的物质结构就是这种细胞合作的结果，而细胞本身就是原子和分子合作的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>This resulting pattern or physical body makes it possible for the cells, atoms and molecules to express themselves, and to fulfill abilities that would be impossible for them in another context.They share to some degree in the perspective reached through the abilities of a physically large body structure, in a way that would be denied to them in other fashions.</td><td>这个因此形成的模式，或说肉体，使细胞、原子和分子得以表达它们自己，并实现它们在另一个背景不可能实现的能力。它们在某种程度上，共享了通过物质的庞大身体结构的能力所达到的视角，而这在其他模式下是无法实现的。</td></tr><tr><td>From their cooperation they achieve a value fulfillment along certain lines.I mentioned the capacity for infinite mobility and transmutation as being one of the laws of the inner universe.The reflection of this law is seen in the latent ability for almost infinite varieties of structures, and endless combinations that can be achieved by the atoms and molecules, and smaller particles of your universe.</td><td>从合作中，它们在某些方面达到了一个值的充盈(valuefulfillment)。我曾提过，无限的移动性与蜕变的能力是)内在宇宙的基本法则之一。这一法则的反映，体现在几乎无限多样的结构，以及你们宇宙的原子、分子与更小粒子所能达成的无尽组合。</td></tr><tr><td>You remember that value fulfillment is also one of our laws of the inner universe, and in this particular instance, the atoms and molecules have the opportunity for value fulfillment along many lines, according to the form that their cooperation and combination may take.</td><td>你们记得，值的充盈(valuefulfillment)也是我们内在宇宙的法则之一，而在这个特定的例子中，原子和分子有机会根据它们可能采取的合作与组合形式，在许多方面都有值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的机会。</td></tr><tr><td>I am explaining this matter rather thoroughly because we will be getting to matters concerning the entity and its personality developments.The entity, for example, works with the same sort of individual cooperation, and uses building blocks of energy in much the same manner, that the atoms and molecules in the physical world combine to form cells, organs, and the whole structure of the physical body.</td><td>我之所以如此透彻地解释这件事，是因为我们将开始谈论有关存有及其人格发展的议题。例如，存有也是用与个体合作的方式在运作，并以大致相同的方式使用能量的构件块(buildingblocksofenergy)，有如物质世界的原子与分子结合形成细胞、器官和整个身体的结构。</td></tr><tr><td>As the various cells maintain their individuality, as they gain in terms of value fulfillment by cooperation and still retain their uniqueness, so also do the various personalities retain their individuality and uniqueness while still cooperating to form the psychic structure of the entity, which in one context also forms them; and with this little problem I will let you take your break.There are more ways to see what is inside an egg than cracking it, as you will discover.</td><td>就像各种细胞保持着它们的个体性，通过合作，实现值的充盈(valuefulfillment)却仍保留它们的独特性，各个不同的人格在合作形成存有的灵性结构时，也仍保有他们的个体性和独特性，在这一种情况下，存有也形成了它们；带着这个小问题，先让你们休息一下。你们会发现，有许多方式可以不用打破鸡蛋，就能看见蛋里有什么。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break

hesitate to interrupt your social break. Nevertheless I will continue.It goes without saying that mankind is not alone in maintaining the physical universe, and in giving it continuity as he projects and constructs his own physical image; and as this image is the direct result of his own inner psychic climate, and as it reflects most faithfully his own inner joy and illness, and as this joy and illness shows itself physically in his image, so also do all living things construct their own images, and help to maintain the physical properties of your universe.</td><td>我很不愿意打断你们的休息互动时间，虽然如此，我还是要继续。不言而喻，人类在维护物质宇宙方面并不孤单，在他投射并建构自己的物质形象时，也赋予了它持续性；由于这个形象是他自己内在灵性气候的直接结果，它最忠实地反映了他自己内在的喜悦和疾病，喜悦和疾病物质性地展现在他的形象中，所有的生灵，也都是这样建构它们自己的形象，并帮助维护你们宇宙的物质特性。</td></tr><tr><td>Not only does the physical matter that composes these images go back into the physical storehouse, to be reused time and time again, but also the physical matter is broken down once again to the state in which it was before its cooperation of parts that formed a particular physical body.</td><td>构成这些形象的实体物质不仅回到物质仓库，被一次次重复使用，而且这些实体物质还会再度被分解，回到它在合作形成特定身体部位之前的状态。</td></tr><tr><td>The cooperation is gone.</td><td>合作不复存在。</td></tr><tr><td>We have spoken of mental enzymes and of their importance.It would be helpful to reread those passages in connection with this material.It is because every atom and molecule contains within it condensed comprehension, inner, direct, codified comprehension, of the inner universe as a whole, that these atoms and molecules are capable of such varied combinations and variations.</td><td>我们谈到过精神酵素及其重要性。重读和这些资料有关的段落会有所帮助。正是因为每个原子和分子其内部都包含了对整个内在宇宙的囊括性的理解，内在的、直接的、编码过的理解，这些原子与分子才能够有如此多样的组合和变化。</td></tr><tr><td>I have said that this condensed comprehension is readily available when it is needed.It is latent within the generalized consciousness of each atom and molecule, and is directly responsible for the combination into cell structure.</td><td>我说过，这种浓缩的理解在需要时是随时可得的。它潜藏在每个原子和分子的广泛性的意识中，并直接负责组合成细胞结构。</td></tr><tr><td>One of Ruburt’s little prize perceptions was his realization that you see, or are aware of, only your own idea constructions.Basically each individual inhabits a completely different world.We will carry this further.</td><td>鲁柏小小锦标的感悟之一就是他意识到，你看到的，或认识到的，只是你自己的理念建构。基本上每一个个体都住在一个完全不同的世界。我们会更进一步探讨这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>As you are not aware of many so-called realities with which your own cat is familiar, so you are completely unaware of other universes that coexist with your own.Your outer senses are equipped to perceive your own camouflage patterns.

within your own physical universe are coherent enough so that all individuals of a given species appear to perceive more or less the same surroundings.There are groupings of perceptions belonging to various species, but all of these perceptions are not inherent in each species.We will cover this more thoroughly later.However, I wanted to make the statement here.</td><td>你们物质宇宙之内的伪装模式是足够连贯一致的，所以一个特定物种的所有个体，似乎都能感知到多少是)相同的周边环境。有属于不同物种的感知分组，但所有这些感知并不是每个物种所固有的。我们将在后面更深入地介绍这一点。不过，我想在这里说一下。</td></tr><tr><td>The material dealing with the interrelationship and cooperation of the various species in their combined maintenance of your physical universe, will take many sessions.However, I will go into the methods involved.You already have a basic statement concerning the mechanisms involved.</td><td>这些涉及各种物种在共同维护你们物质宇宙中的相互关系和合作的资料，将会花上许多节课。然而，我将进入所涉及的方法。关于其中的机制，你们已经有了一个基本的说法。</td></tr><tr><td>The fact is, that even in your own universe all of your camouflage forms are not perceived by any one species, your own included.At best your scientists will only discover more of these camouflage patterns, but the entire system will simply not be perceived by any one species, and you will never perceive camouflage patterns outside of your own patterns.You are simply blocked in the pursuit of knowledge beyond a certain point as long as your scientists persist in the lines of their present development.</td><td>事实上，即使在你们自己的宇宙中，你们所有的伪装形态也都不被任何一个物种所感知，包括你们自己的族类。你们的科学家充其量只能发现更多的这些伪装模式，但整个系统根本不会被任何一个物种所感知，你们永远也不会感知到自己模式之外的伪装模式。只要你们的科学家坚持他们目前的发展路线，你们在追求超越某个点的知识方面，就会受到阻碍。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner senses can perceive other camouflage patterns, with training.As I mentioned, there are universes coexistent with your own, but your camouflage outer senses cannot perceive these.Nor with your limited cause and effect theories will you ever get very far.</td><td>经过训练，内在感官能够感知其他的伪装模式。我说过，有一些宇宙与你们的宇宙共存，但你们伪装的外在感官感知不到这些宇宙。以你们有限的因果理论，也不可能走得很远。</td></tr><tr><td>The cause and effect theory, as I have stated, is a result of your ideas of time.As long as you persist in thinking in terms of past, present and future, then the cause and effect theory is a logical and seemingly infallible

effect is a passe and antiquated theory, useful only for a short time—I hope you appreciate the pun with the word time—and should be discarded.</td><td>因果论，正如我所说，是你们的时间观念造成的结果。只要你们坚持从过去、现在和未来的角度去思考，那么因果论就是一个合乎逻辑的、看似无懈可击的结果。当你们发展你们的时间理论，并认识到现在、过去和未来只是你们自己的观点所造成的影响和扭曲，那么你们的科学家们就会认识到，因果论是一种过时的、陈旧的理论，只在短时间内有用--我希望你能欣赏"时间"这个词的双关语，并且应该被抛弃。</td></tr><tr><td>There

deliberate manner at 10:45.)</td><td>(10:35休息。珍解离如常。休息期间，我们一直设法给吉姆·坦南特这份资料的一些基本重点。吉姆同意在珍和我星期三晚上上课的时候，他也开始读以前的资料，这可能是个一石二鸟的好主意。他也说到要把一些课录下来，对此我们并不反对。珍在10:45从容地恢复。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have rushed in one manner, giving you some excellent material to follow that last session, and yet the quality did not suffer, though I pushed Ruburt rather far.He was somewhat concerned since you have begun having witnesses, and you will see the material speaks for itself.This is a process of education.When you are asked about these sessions, that is your answer.On my part, I am an educator.Any results or so-called demonstrations will be the result of training, study, discipline and exercises.</td><td>我用某种方式仓促地给了你们一份绝佳的资料，做为上一节课的后续，然而质量并没有受到影响，尽管我把鲁伯逼得相当远。他有些担心，因为你们已经开始有见证人了，你们会看到这份资料本身将不证自明。这是一个教育的过程。当你们被问及这些课程时，这就是你们的回答。就我而言，我是一个教育者。任何结果或所谓的示范都将是训练、研究、纪律和练习的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>The material will always be the basic tool for study.The suggestions given in the material, the exercises in psychological time and so forth, are to be approached as you approached them, after a thorough knowledge of the material, and familiarity with the purposes behind the experiments.</td><td>这个资料永远是学习的基本工具。在充分了解资料，并熟悉实验背后的目的后，你们就能在触及这些资料后，进行资料中所给出的建议，心理时间的练习等等。</td></tr><tr><td>I have often told you of the possible dangers involved in approaching experiments without the safeguards of discipline and study.After attendance at an initial session, those interested should then begin a study of the material.In no instance should any experiments be tried by witnesses in the

want these sessions to get the reputation of giving demonstrations, for reasons that are rather complicated.The way in which I have given you the material results in a steady progression, and this is important.At later times my attitude may change.However, because of the attitude in the scientific world at large, these sessions should have a more sober climate, in that I do not want either of you to be thought of, in Ruburt’s words, as a pair of nuts.</td><td>还有一个原因。我不希望这些课程被冠以示范表演的名声，原因相当复杂。我给你们提供资料的方式，导致了稳定的进展，这很重要。过一段时间，我的态度也许会改变。然而，由于整个科学界的态度，这些课程应该有一个更清醒的气氛，因为我不希望你们任何一个人，用鲁伯的话说，被认为是一对疯子。</td></tr><tr><td>And I am just the boy to give the sessions a sobriety, as you well know.</td><td>而我正是给这些课带来冷静清醒的那个小伙子(theboy)，你们很清楚这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>Now returning briefly, I would like again to mention our spacious present, in which all things have their existence.When the spacious present is understood, with its attributes of spontaneity, then the cause and effect theory will fall.The cause and effect theory being the result of continuity holds no water.Basically, the spacious present as you know does have durability, because of the existence of value fulfillment.</td><td>现在，简短地再说回来一下，我想再提提我们广阔的现在，在这个广阔的现在中，所有的事物都有它们的存在。当理解了广阔的现在，理解了它的自发性属性，那么因果论就会落空。因果论是连续性的结果，是不成立的。基本上，广阔的现在如你所知，的确有)持久性(durability)，因为有值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的存在。</td></tr><tr><td>It does not have continuity, in the manner in which the term continuity is usually used.Continuity usually implies one thing happening before or after another.The spacious present contains instead spontaneity, and within it all happenings are simultaneous, and yet there is durability.</td><td>就"连续性"这个词的一般用法而言，广阔的现在是没有连续性的。"连续性"通常意味着一件事在另一件事之前或之后发生。广阔的现在反而包含了自发性，在它之内，所有发生的事情都是同时的，但又有持久性。</td></tr><tr><td>The durability is achieved because of constant expansion in terms of value fulfillment.Your camouflage physical universe does, necessarily, lead you to suppose that time exists in terms of past, present and future, simply because the idea or energy constructed into physical reality therefore operates under physical properties.</td><td>持久性的实现，是因为在值的充盈(valuefulfillment)方面的不断扩展。你们的伪装物质宇宙确实，出于必要，必然导致你认为时间是以过去、现在和未来存在的。只因为理念或能量建构成为了物质实相，因此在物质属性之下运作。</td></tr><tr><td>There is so much of which you are not aware.You have taken certain arbitrary points of beginning and departure for practical purposes, as for example the birth of a child used to be considered the actual entry of consciousness.Now your scientists realize that the living human being is indeed alive in the womb.Centuries ago this was not admitted.</td><td>很多事情你们不知道。你们为了实用的目的，任意地采取了某些起点和出发点，例如，孩子的出生曾经被认为是意识实际进入之刻。现在你们的科学家认识到，躺在子宫里的，的确是活生生的人。几个世纪以前，这一点是不被承认的。</td></tr><tr><td>Any physical image brings up this problem.When does it actually attain life?You know of course that the consciousness is the first, the image is the second resulting phenomenon.</td><td>任何身体形象都会引起这个问题。它到底在什么时候获得生命的？你们当然知道，首先有意识，形像是第二个产生的现象。</td></tr><tr><td>The physical body image that seems to die at a particular point, and seems to enter your physical universe at a particular point, does neither.There is no particular minute or hour for the materialization or dematerialization of the physical body.Only your perspective makes it seem so.</td><td>肉身形体似乎在某一特定点死亡，又似乎在某一特定点进入你们的物质宇宙，其实两者皆非。肉体的物质化或非物质化，不在特定的某时某分。只是你们的视角让它看起来如此。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane smiled.)</td><td>(珍笑了。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your life, believe it or not, basically, is a simultaneous happening.You merely see it in slow motion.</td><td>你们的生命，不管你们相不相信，基本上，是一种同时事件。你们只是看着它慢动作地进行。</td></tr><tr><td>The true meaning and the true happening in your life occurs along the lines of value fulfillment, in terms of comprehensions, psychological experiences, and fulfillments that do not take up space, and that are independent of time as you know it.</td><td>你生命中真正的意义和与真实的事件是沿着值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的方向发生的，就理解、心理实验，以及满盈(fulfillments)方面而言，它们不占据空间，也独立于你们所知的时间之外。</td></tr><tr><td>You cannot perceive either the consciousness or comprehension, condensed and latent, in the sperm, and then in the fetus, before the human body’s complete construction; nor can you see or perceive the comprehension or the consciousness that is still there, when so-called death occurs.</td><td>你们既不能在人体的完整结构形成之前，觉察到存在于精子中、继而在胎体中的浓缩和潜藏的意识或理解力；当所谓的死亡发生时，你们也不能看到或觉察到仍然存在的理解力或意识。</td></tr><tr><td>This does not mean that a human being contains no consciousness before the moment, or the arbitrary point of birth.You merely say life begins here.Your saying so, however, does not preclude the fact that consciousness began long before.</td><td>这并不意味着，人类在出生之前，或在诞生的那随意点之前没有意识。你们只是说生命，就从这里开始。然而，即便你们这样说，也不能排除意识早在很久之前就开始了的事实。</td></tr><tr><td>Your arbitrary decision that consciousness ends with the change of physical properties at the arbitrary point you call death, does not preclude the fact that consciousness does not end here.There is a metamorphosis that occurs with the change of the fetus from a fetus into a fullblown, miniature human being at birth.This change is not much looked into, because it occurs beyond the reach of your outer senses.Nevertheless this metamorphosis involves, in appearance, such a change as to seem impossible.</td><td>你们武断地决定，意识随着身体属性的改变，在你们所谓的死亡点结束，并不能排除意识并没有在这里结束的事实。有一种蜕变(metamorphosis)发生在胎儿从胚胎到诞生时成为发展成熟的迷你人类的这个改变中。这个改变并不怎么被深入探究，因为它发生在你们的外在感官无法触及之处。然而从表面上看，这个蜕变涉及了看似不可能的变化。</td></tr><tr><td>At the other end, so to speak, there is also a change which you do not perceive, and you do not perceive it because as the consciousness constructs the fetus from the inner plane, so then the consciousness is now beginning to enter another plane, where it is equally beyond your perception.</td><td>在另一端，可以这么说，还有一个变化，你们没有感知到，而你们之所以没有感知到，是因为随着意识从内部层面构造胎儿，那么意识现在开始进入另一个层面，而那个层面，它同样超出你们的感知范围。</td></tr><tr><td>It merely ceases to construct the physical image.There is no great mystery here.What seems a mystery is merely the result of ignorance.I always hesitate when we approach this subject, since your so-called spiritualists, while possessing some knowledge, usually cloak

robes.</td><td>它只是不再构造物质形象。这里没有什么大的奥秘。看似神秘的东西，只是无知的结果。每当我们要触及这个主题时，我总是犹豫不决，因为你们所谓的灵修)者，虽然拥有一些知识，但通常会把他们所拥有的任何知识，披上伪神秘主义的华丽外衣。他们就像法兰克·沃茨穿着共济会的长袍一样愚蠢。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here, as though for my benefit,

and yet this forest of spacious present does not take up space, as you think of space.</td><td>带着这个比喻，我们再往前推进一大步。现在，我们将把整个森林，如果你能想像到的话，称之为广阔的现在。树木被比作意识，所有的意识都同时存在；而这片广阔现在的森林，并不像你所想的那样，占用空间。</td></tr><tr><td>There is no past, present or future in your terms within it, but only a now.Because of the endless possibilities within this now, durability is maintained in terms of value fulfillment, the fulfillment of literally endless values.Therefore the forest is constantly expanding.Remember your expanding universe theory, but not in terms of space or indeed in terms of time, but in terms of fulfillment of abilities and values that may be constructed upon various levels and in various guises, your present plane of existence being one.</td><td>在它之内，没有你们所说的过去、现在或将来，只有现在。因为在这个现在之内，有无限的可能性，所以，在值的充盈(valuefulfillment)下，持久性被维持着，实现了字面上的无限的价值(endlessvalues)。因此，森林是不断扩展的。记住你们的宇宙扩展理论，但不是从空间或时间的角度来看，而是从能力和值的充盈来看，这些能力和值可以在不同的层面和不同的)伪装中被建构，你们现在的存在层面就是一个。</td></tr><tr><td>And in each of these planes of existence there is a reflection of the basic laws of the spacious present itself, which I am in the process of giving you.Therefore there is no need, really, to think of a given group of entities before the birth of your planet.I have said that all the entities who would ever dwell upon your plane did exist, and actually have a hand in on the creation of your planet, that would ever dwell upon it.</td><td>而在这些存在的每一个层面中，都有一个反映广阔的现在的基本法则，而我正在为你们提供这资料。因此，真的没有必要，去想那一群在你们星球诞生之前就已存在的特定存有。我说过，所有会住在你们层面上的存有，它们确实存在，并且实际上也参与了你们星球的创造，并会住在你们的星球上。</td></tr><tr><td>I also said that new entities were being formed, but in the framework of the spacious present all this is spontaneous.The contradiction seems a contradiction only on your terms.On my terms there is none.For practical purposes you may say, in truth on your own terms, that entities simply have had time to develop further personalities.But I want it understood that this is true only within your own time framework.</td><td>我也说过，新的存有正在形成，但在广阔的现在架构里，这一切都是自发的。矛盾似乎只有在你们的条件下才显得矛盾。在我的说法中，没有矛盾。为了实际的目的，你们可以说，以你们的说法，事实上，存有只是有时间去发展进一步的人格。但我要你们了解，这只有在你们自己的时间架构内才是真的。</td></tr><tr><td>There is much yet to be covered dealing with a spontaneity that is nevertheless durable.I have also said that your own present existence occurs simultaneously.You only perceive it in slow motion.</td><td>然而，关于持久的自发性还有很多要谈论的。我也说过，你自己的当下存在是同时发生的。你只是以慢动作在感知它。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break, and if this hasn’t broken you up then nothing will.You are indeed as you can see broken up a million times, and put together in many various manners; and yet you retain the inner ego, and in other words your own identity.But this identity must change.This again is no contradiction.Nothing can be static, and believe it or not, nothing is.</td><td>我建议你们休息(break)一下，如果这还没有让你们崩溃(broken)，那就没有什么能让你们崩溃了。你)们其实像你们看到的那样，被拆解了百万次，再以各种不同的方式组合在一起；但你仍然保留着内在的自我，换句话说，你自己的本体身份(identity)。但这个本体身份必须改变。这里仍然没有矛盾。没有任何事物可以一成不变，不管你信不信，没有什么是一成不变的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:58.Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed dictating in the same energetic manner at 10:08.)</td><td>(9:58休息。珍解离如常。10:08她又以同样精力十足的方式继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>An entity can indeed in some ways be compared to a tree that brings forth many seeds, the seeds being individuals in themselves, with all the potentialities to become themselves full entities.</td><td>存有在某些方面确实可以比作一棵树，它能结出许多种子，种子本身就是个体，具有成为完整存有的所有潜力。</td></tr><tr><td>Many, as I have said, do.That is, many fragment personalities do become entities.We are dealing here with a psychic tree however, and the seeds or personalities that do not develop into entities, do not because they do not choose to do so.</td><td>正如我所说，很多都是这样。也就是说，很多片段人格确实都成为了存有。不过，我们这里说的是灵性的树，那些没有发展成存有的种子或人格，之所以没有发展成，是因为它们没有选择这么做。</td></tr><tr><td>I will go further and shock you thoroughly, by mentioning that your regular seeds that do not develop, do not fail as a rule because of a lack of the necessary environmental ingredients, but simply because, for various reasons during a particular arbitrary point, they do not choose to so develop.</td><td>我将更进一步，彻底地震撼你，我要说，你们普通的种子不发育，并不是因为缺乏必要的环境成分而失败，而只是因为在某个特定的任意点上，由于各种原)因，它们没有选择如此发育。</td></tr><tr><td>This applies to the seeds of any flower or tree or person.I have told you that consciousness is in all things, and the power behind all things.The entity itself constantly changes, and an entity can indeed choose to disintegrate.</td><td>这适用于任何花木的种子或人。我告诉过你们，意识存在于万物之中，是万物背后的力量。存有本身不断变化，存有确实可以选择解体。</td></tr><tr><td>You see the growth process in a very distorted manner, because of your antiquated cause and effect theory.Growth on your plane is merely the reflection, or one of the reflections, of value fulfillment, seen through the distorted lens of your perspective.</td><td>因为你们陈旧的因果理论，你们以一种非常扭曲的方式看待成长过程。在你们层面，成长只是值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的反映，或者说是其中的一个反映，经由你们视角的扭曲镜头被看到。</td></tr><tr><td>Change, as you must know, involves not only growth but a complete disorientation, to make way for a different, perhaps newer, orientation.You see value fulfillment in terms of growth, and therefore think of disintegration in terms of psychic destruction and death.That is, you see an ending as the effect of any beginning.</td><td>你们一定知道，改变，不仅涉及到成长，还涉及到完全的迷失(disorientation)，来为一个不同的、也许是更新的方向让路。你们从成长的角度看待值的充盈(valuefulfillment)，因此从灵性的毁灭和死亡的角度来看解体(disintegration)。也就是说，你们把一个结束看作是任何开始的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>This is indeed unfortunate, since there is only a change of form, one form fading into another form.There is no actual point of death, in your terms.You cannot set a certain time to even a individual death, any more than you can set a time for any individual birth.</td><td>这确实是遗憾，因为只有形态的改变，它是一种形态淡入到另一种形态中。没有一个确切的死亡点，套用你们的用语。你不能为一个个体的死亡定下一个特定的时间，就像你不能为任何个体的出生设定一个时间一样。</td></tr><tr><td>The change is always gradual, even in so far as your own perspective is concerned.The change is gradual because the change is spontaneous.If the change were not spontaneous and not ever occurring and reoccurring, then you could say "now this is the moment of birth or death."</td><td>变化总是循序渐进的，即使就你们自己的视角，也是如此。变化之所以是渐进的，是因为变化是自发的。如果变化不是自发的，不是持续一再发生，那你们就可以说"现在，这就是出生或死亡的那一刻。"</td></tr><tr><td>Even on your own plane, as seen in the physical corpse itself, the physical images does not suddenly cease.In fact, you have an old superstition in some parts of your own country, that a man is not truly dead until everyone who ever knew him is dead.And this is true.</td><td>即使是在你们自己的层面上，从肉身的尸体本身来看，肉体的形象也不会突然终止。事实上，在你们自己国家的某些地方，你们有一个古老的迷信，一个人不是真的死去，除非认识他的人全都死了。而这是真的。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true because everyone who is acquainted with a particular individual creates his own image of him, as he creates his own image of them.As long as memory of a particular individual is alive, that particular personality still exists upon your plane, and this is not always to his advantage.</td><td>这是真的，因为每一个与某个个体相识的人，都会自己创造这个体的形象，如同这个体也会创造他们的形象一样。只要对某一个个体的记忆还在，这特定个体的人格就依然存在你们的层面上。而这不一定对这个体有利。</td></tr><tr><td>I will have more to say, per usual.I suggest your break, and keep in mind that I will speak more on the construction of the entity, the tree analogy being a good one, because all of our imaginary seeds do not develop into trees.This does not necessarily mean, either, that there is a deficiency; merely that the consciousness involved does not choose for one reason or another to materialize fully in a particular form, or to develop any given abilities along certain lines.This may also represent a needed resting point.</td><td>和平常一样，我还有很多话要说。我建议你们休息一下，并记住我还要多谈谈存有的建构，树的比喻很好，因为所有我们想像中的种子都不会发展成树。这也不一定意味著有缺陷；只是所涉及的意识由于某种原因，没有选择以某种特定的形式完全具体化，或是没有选择朝着某些方面发展任何特定的能力。这或许也代表一个必要的休息点。</td></tr><tr><td>And you may also now take your resting point.</td><td>现在你们也可以取得你们的休息点。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:27.Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed at 10:33.)</td><td>(10:27休息。珍解离如常。10:33继续，)</td></tr><tr><td>At the same time you know of what I am speaking, at the same time you are aware of all that I say.Otherwise it would make no sense to you at all.</td><td>在我说话的同时，你知道我在说什么，同时你也觉知我所说的一切。否则，对你们来说根本就没有意义。</td></tr><tr><td>A certain level of personal comprehension, and a mixture of personal discipline and freedom is necessary.In order for this material to come through, you must have already reached an element of inner freedom, and a certain ability to realize your own existence behind the camouflage patterns with which you are usually concerned.</td><td>必须要有一定的个人领悟能力，以及个人自律与自由的结合。为了让这种资料能够传送过来，你们必定已经触及了内在自由的要素，以及一定的能力，已体现你自己在你通常关注的伪装模式背后的存在。</td></tr><tr><td>You have read of so-called mediums—and I detest the term—speaking gibberish, the explanation being given that the so-called spirit could not come through.Nevertheless so-called gibberish in such an instance merely represents, when it is legitimate, the fact that no new comprehensions or knowledge can be so transmitted entirely by the means of an entity speaking from another plane.</td><td>你们读过所谓的灵媒的乱语(gibberish)——我讨厌灵媒这个词，给出的解释是，所谓的灵(spirit)无法过来。然而，在这种情况下的所谓的乱语，当它是正当的时候，只是代表，没有新的理解或知识可以借由一个存有，从另一个层面，以说话的方式，如此完整地传递过来。</td></tr><tr><td>The individuals receiving such knowledge already are capable of understanding it, and their own inner ego helps them in this comprehension.I have been against the deep trance for this reason, in that I prefer to work with you in such a manner that you are able to use this knowledge consciously, and also feel that you have a part in its delivery.</td><td>接收这类知识的个体已经有能力理解它，他们自己内在的自我帮助了他们进行这种理解。我一直反对深度出神，原因就在这里，因为我更愿意以你们能够有意识地利用这些知识，同时觉得自己在知识的传递中也参与了一份的方式与你们合作。</td></tr><tr><td>We will now go into one of our basic laws of the universe, and of the spacious present, which would seem to need little explanation: that of creation.</td><td>我们现在要探讨我们宇宙的基本法则之一，以及广阔的现在，这似乎不需要什么解释：那就是创造。</td></tr><tr><td>On your plane each atom and molecule contains the potentiality for any physical construction whatsoever.Each atom and molecule contains, as I have said, a generalized consciousness, in which all of the basic laws are known, and also a limited but definite self-awareness.</td><td>在你们的层面上，我说过，每一个原子和分子都包含任何物质建构的潜力。正如我所说的，每个原子和分子都包含一种广泛性的意识，在其中，同时也包含着一种有限但明确的自觉。</td></tr><tr><td>This self-awareness in each atom and molecule determines what sort of cell or combination that the particular atom or molecule will form.The cells then, being a gestalt, contain the individual conscious components, which then form a consciousness greater than the consciousness of any individual component within, and different in scope and ability.</td><td>每个原子和分子的这种自觉，决定了特定的原子或分子会形成什么样的细胞或组合。那么，细胞作为一种完形，就包含了各个意识成分，然后形成了一个比内部任何单个成分的意识都要大的意识，在范围和能力上也有不同。</td></tr><tr><td>In other words the whole in almost any case is more than the sum of its parts.Yet the inner consciousness of the individual atoms and molecules is not changed;

delivery of the word extral, I checked Webster’s Unabridged for 1951.The prefix extral was not listed nor was extralvalue; but extralimitary, meaning outside the limit or boundary, was.It might be said that the overtones of the two words, extralvalue and extralimitary, were the same.Jane speculated that since she had studied Latin in high school Seth might have used her own subconscious knowledge to coin a new word.</td><td>(出于对珍传递过来的"extral"这个词的好奇，我查了1951年韦伯词典未删节版(Webster’sUnabridged)。首码extral没有列出，extralvalue也没有列出；但有"extralimitary"，意思是在极限或边界之外，有可能"extralvalue"和"extralimitary"这两个词的大意是一样的。珍推测，可能因为她高中读过拉丁文，所以赛斯可能利用她自己的潜意识知识打造了一个新词。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane

the outer ego.</td><td>我没有意识到，这种特殊的经历会这么早发生。它其实代表一种聚焦完整的内在能量的惊人能力。换句话说，就是从内在宇宙中，指挥和集中人格内固有的全部能量，因此，必须谨慎和有纪律地使用它。绝不应该让它用在属于外在自我情绪的目的上。</td></tr><tr><td>This is rather unpleasant, but such an energy used unwittingly, say, when Ruburt was feeling upset with a certain person, could lead to unfavorable circumstances for the person involved, nor is this shades of witchcraft.Any energy can be used for

it was almost as though I could predict when I would experience the sensation, almost as though it was close to becoming routine.</td><td>(那之后，每听到一种声音，如知更鸟的叫声、汽车经过的声音、房子里其他地方的声音等，这种感觉就会以较小的程度的回来，我几乎可以预测我什么时候会经历这种感觉，仿佛已经接近成为常规了。</td></tr><tr><td>(I told myself I would visit Ed and Ella Robbins.Whether a dream or not I do not know, but I seemed to roam through their house.Flash of young daughter Lorrie, running from living room to kitchen area;

using only the sense of smell, you would also be severely limited.</td><td>就好像你被送进了某个陌生而迷人的草原，但只给你视觉。想像一下你会错过什么：鲜活大地的气味、声)音、脚下泥土的触感、背上的阳光；只用嗅觉，你也一样会严重受限。</td></tr><tr><td>Yet you are more limited than this by far.It is important for the race of men now to begin to use and experiment with the inner senses, since for the potentialities of humanity to be fully realized, new concepts must arise which cannot arise in the limited scope he now permits himself.Because the cells and molecules in general have consciousness, because they contain within themselves a capsule comprehension of the universe as a whole, and because they contain the ability to form into an almost infinite variety of form, there is a kinship between every atom and molecule, a basic enduring connection, regardless of the separate appearance which is seen using the outer senses.</td><td>然而你们的局限性远不止于此。现在对人这个族类来说，开始运用和实验内在感官是很重要的，因为人类的潜能要完全发挥出来，必须出现新的概念，而这些概念，在他们现在允许自己的有限范围内，无法产生。因为细胞和分子普遍都具有意识，因为它们本身就包含着对宇宙整体的囊括性理解，因为它们包含着形成几乎无限种类形态的能力，所以不管用外在感官看到的独立外观如何，每一个原子和分子之间都有一种亲缘关系，一种基本而持久的联系。</td></tr><tr><td>Because I have given you such excellent material, you may take your first break with light hearts.</td><td>因为我给你们提供了这么好的资料，你们可以带着轻快的心态进行第一次休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27.Jane was quite dissociated for a first delivery, she said.Seth came through well.When she is dissociated Jane said she does not worry about distortions in the material.She also realized that the bothersome kink had disappeared from her neck. The combination, psychio-physical was not familiar to her.</td><td>(9:27休息。珍说她在第一段的传讯过程中相当解离。赛斯过来得很顺利。珍说，在解离状态中，她并不担心资料的扭曲。她还意识到，脖子不适的症状消失了，"灵性物质"这个词组，她并不熟悉。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed dictation at 10:32.)</td><td>(10:32珍继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>The boundaries, limitations, extent and vistas of the self are merely arbitrary.In a very true sense each self is infinite, unbounded, connected in a most intimate way to all other things in the universe on your plane; and through the inner senses and the inner ego connected also in a most intimate way to the unknown and unseen inner universe.</td><td>自己的这些边界、限制、范围和视野只是武断主观的。在一个非常真实的意义上，每一个自己都是无限的、没有束缚的，在你们层面上以最亲密的方式与宇宙中所有其他万物相连；透过内在感官和内在自我，每一个自己也以最亲密的方式与未知的、看不见的内在宇宙相连。</td></tr><tr><td>Here we run into something that will be difficult for me to explain to you.Any particular self theoretically could expand his consciousness to contain the universe and everything in it.The closed-in, solitary, isolated self of which you are so proud is, as I have said, an arbitrary formation, containing the core of identity; and you seem to prefer, psychically speaking, to stay at home.</td><td>这里我们遇到了某件我很难向你们解释的事。任何一个特定的自己，理论上，都可以把他的意识扩展到包含宇宙和宇宙内的一切。你所引以为傲的封闭、单独、孤立的自己，如我所说，是一种任意的组建，包含着本体身份的核心；从心理上讲，你们似乎更喜欢待在家里。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's delivery had by now become very slow; at times while she delivered this material, she would pause for several seconds between words, pacing slowly back and forth.)</td><td>(珍的传述现在变得很慢；有时在传述这资料时，她会在两字之间停顿几秒钟，慢慢地来回踱步。)</td></tr><tr><td>Because of the basic simplicity of the elements in your universe, and for other reasons already mentioned, there is no real boundary neither chemical. electrical or even psychic, between the self and what is usually considered not self.</td><td>由于你们宇宙中元素的基本简单性，以及其他已经提到的原因，所以在自己和通常被认为的非自己之间，没有真正的界限，无论是化学的、电的，甚至是灵性的。</td></tr><tr><td>Chemically in particular, the dependence of the physical body and the self to the planetary environment is obvious.It is known to your scientists that the chemical relationship between the personal physical self, and the chemical environment of the not-self is intimately connected.</td><td>特别是在化学方面，身体和自己对星球环境的依赖性是显而易见的。你们的科学家们知道，个人的肉身自己与非自己的化学环境之间，有着紧密相连的化学关系。</td></tr><tr><td>In the same manner that you are dependent upon, say, green plants for your very physical survival, so the interdependence and connections continue in all other fields.The physical construction of your universe, as I have said, is carried on by all life, not just human life.Each psychio-physical pattern of existence does its part in continuing the maintenance, and renewing construction, of the physical universe.</td><td>就像你们的肉体生存依赖于绿色植物一样，所有其他领域的相互依存和联系也都在继续。正如我所说，你们宇宙的物质构造，是由所有的生命共同进行的，不是只有人类。每一个灵性-物质的存在模形，都在持续维护和更新建构物质宇宙的过程中发挥自己的作用。</td></tr><tr><td>Man, staying within the core of his arbitrarily designated selfhood, can in truth be compared to early physical man, cowering within his cave.You have learned to venture forth into the physical universe.You have not learned to venture forth from an arbitrarily designated selfhood, into an extended environment that knows no space or time.Such a possibility, such a future development in no way involves a denial of self, a dissolving or sweeping away of self, an annihilation of self.</td><td>人类，一直停留在他随意设定的自性核心内，真的可以与早期龟缩在自己洞穴内的人类相比。你们学会了进入物质宇宙冒险。你们没学会从随意选定的自性中，大胆挺进一个延展出去的环境，知道那里没有时间或空间。这样的可能性，这样的未来发展，完全不是要否定自己，消解或扫除自己，消灭自己。</td></tr><tr><td>Many cavemen doubtlessly feared for their personal survival when they ventured forth upon the earth in daylight.They feared that their selves would be annihilated.Such a development as we are considering involves instead an expansion or extension; in the same manner that the expanding universe takes up no space, but expands in terms of value fulfillment, so the expanding consciousness would take up no space, but would also expand in terms of value fulfillment.This is your new frontier, your new challenge.</td><td>许多穴居人在白天冒险来到地面上时，无疑地会担心自己的生存。他们害怕自己会被消灭。我们正在思索的这样一种发展，涉及的反而是一种扩展或延伸；同样的方式，扩展中的宇宙不占据空间，而是在值的充盈(valuefulfillment)方面扩展，所以扩展中的意识也不占据空间，但也是在值的充盈(valuefulfillment)方面扩展。这是你们的新疆域，你们的新挑战。</td></tr><tr><td>This arbitrary limitation set upon the individual self is put upon it by its reliance upon the outer senses, as a method of perceiving reality.The outer senses are excellent tools of perception for limited circumstances. However, man has relied upon them so long, and with such cringing dependence, that now they threaten to hamper his own growth and development.</td><td>这种对个体自己的任意限制，是由于它倚赖外在感官作为感知现实的方法而施加的。在有限的情况下，外在感官是很好的感知工具，然而，人类对它们的倚赖是如此之久，而且是如此畏缩不前的依赖，以至于现在它们已威胁到，妨碍人类自身的成长和发展。</td></tr><tr><td>I have mentioned that the individual cells and molecules, atoms and other basic structures, definitely gain in their formation into the gestalt of a more complicated structure, being able to participate in experiences and value fulfillments that would otherwise not be possible for them in their own simpler isolated form.This is of prime importance.</td><td>我提到过，个别的细胞和分子、原子和其他基本结构，在形成一个结构更复杂的完形中，绝对有所增益，能够参与经历和值的充盈(valuefulfillment)，否则以它们本身比较简单又孤立的形式是不可能的。这是最重要的。</td></tr><tr><td>The expanding self, ideally, would reach out beyond the arbitrary boundaries it has placed upon itself.Again, there just is not any particular boundary between what is self and what is not self.There are gradations, and that is all.The skin is as much, if not more, a necessary connective as it is a boundary.</td><td>理想的情况下，不断扩展中的自己，会超越它给自己设置的任意界限。再次，在什么是自己，和什么不是自己之间，本来就没有任何特定的界限。有层次变化，仅此而已。皮肤就是一个必要的连接物，不亚于它作为一个边界。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take your break.This material may get slightly more difficult.It is actually so beautifully simple.Only the need to translate conceptions into words causes any complications.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。这份资料可能会变得稍微有点难度。它实际上是如此美妙地简易。只是需要将概念转化为文字，使它变得复杂了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:02.Jane was fully dissociated—way out, she said.She could feel Seth trying to make her use certain phrases rather than others, in order to make the material as clear as possible.She also had a vague idea of the general direction in which the material was headed.</td><td>(10:02休息。珍说她完全解离了——神出得很远。她能感觉到赛斯试图让她使用某些短语，而不是其他短语，以便使资料尽可能清晰。她对资料的大方向，也有一个模糊的概念。</td></tr><tr><td>(She had a long rest period, and indeed needed the rest.She resumed in a normal but emphatic voice, using many gestures, and with the usual darkening of her eyes, at 10:14.)</td><td>(她休息了很久，也确实需要休息。10:14她以正常但强调的声音继续，用了许多手势，眼睛像往常一样变黑。)</td></tr><tr><td>The isolated self, as you know it, can indeed be well compared to man's early caves.In terms of value fulfillment the species expanded its potential tremendously when it left the caves; and so will man also experience the fulfillment of still un-glimpsed potentialities when he walks forth from the cave of the arbitrarily limited self.</td><td>如你知道的那样，孤立的自己，确实可以很好地被比作为早期的洞穴人类。在值的充盈(valuefulfillment)方面，当物种离开洞穴后，它的潜力得到了极大的扩展；当人类从任意限制的自己这个洞穴走出来时，也)会经验到那仍未被瞥见过的潜能之丰盈。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane laughed.)</td><td>(珍笑着说。)</td></tr><tr><td>I shouldn’t have to say this.The image is truly astounding and ludicrous.However, as your expanding universe does not expand in space, so your expanded self will not grow in space to amazing proportions of pounds and tons.</td><td>我不应该这样说。这个画面实在是惊人，太荒谬了。然而，就像你们扩展的宇宙不会在空间中膨胀一样，你们扩展的自己，也不会在空间中增长惊人的磅数和吨数的比例。</td></tr><tr><td>When you realize that the self has no boundaries, then you can begin to make progress.Since consciousness to begin with does not exist in space, then there is no reason why the consciousness cannot so expand beyond its set limitations, and theoretically continue to do so.Such an expansion would give excellent impetus and value experience to those basic components, the cells and molecules, experience that would be retained and utilized.When so-called space travel becomes truly popular, truly practical, it will come along these lines.</td><td>当你们明白自己是没有边界的，那么你们就可以开始进步了。既然意识一开始就不存在于空间，那意识就没理由不能如此扩展，超越它的既定限制，而且理论上还可以继续下去。这样的扩展会给那些基本的组成部分--细胞和分子带来极佳的推动力和可取的经验，这些经验会被保留和利用。当所谓的太空旅行真正普及，真正实际可行的时候，它就会朝向这些方向发展。</td></tr><tr><td>The self will truly utilize the atoms and molecules;

But then you cannot be at your best all the time.</td><td>我发现你们俩今晚都很累，但你们也不可能总是处于最佳状态。</td></tr><tr><td>You could be at your best all the time if you followed certain rather sane rules which I hope to go into later for your benefit.Incidentally, the weather does indeed affect your moods, even as your moods affect the weather, and we will also go into this later.As far as my mention of May 23rd in connection with Miss Callahan, this was not a distortion; and the crisis, which was a psychio-physical crisis, came as I said that it would.The Miss Callahan mentioned in connection with the 23rd was the first mentioned of that date, as Ruburt somewhat belatedly realized today.The restlessness which was apparent in Miss Callahan’s behavior when Ruburt saw her, was but a small tangible evidence of the inner crisis.The crisis itself was a psychic one mainly, which will of course have physical consequences.Miss Callahan was forced to realize that even her home surroundings were no longer familiar, nor is she easy within their confines.</td><td>如果你们遵循某些相当明智的规则，可以一直处于最佳状态，为了你们好，我希望以后讲讲这件事。顺带一提，天气确实会影响你的心情，甚至你的心情也会影响天气，这个我们后面也会讲到。至于我提到的5月23日与卡拉汉小姐的关系，这里没有扭曲；至于危机，是一次灵性-物质(psychio-physical)的危机，它会发生，就如我说的那样。说到卡拉汉小姐与23日有关，是鲁伯后来意识到的事情。当鲁伯见到卡拉汉小姐时，她的行为明显地表现出不安，这只是内在危机的一个小小实证。危机本身主要是灵性上的，当然会造成身体上的后果。卡拉汉小姐被迫意识到，连她家的周遭环境都不再熟悉，在其范围内，她也不安逸。</td></tr><tr><td>A dispersion has begun in which the ego will find it more and more difficult to hold energy within forms of personal identity, or to use energy for the purposes of the ego.The energy will fly every which way, uncontrolled, and no longer channeled.Habit will still have some power of restraint for a while yet, but whole blocks of conceptual realizations, and whole blocks of time realizations, are now surely drifting away from the ego’s control.</td><td>一种弥散已经开始，自我会发现，愈来愈难在个人身份的形体中保持能量，或为了自我的目的使用能量。能量将四处飞散、不受控制、也不再受引导。习惯，在一段时间内，还会有一些克制的力量，但是整块概念的体认(wholeblocksofconceptualrealizations)，和整块时间的体认(wholeblocksoftimerealizations)，现在肯)定会从自我的控制中飘走。</td></tr><tr><td>The return home temporarily seemed to stop this steady progress toward diffusion.The crisis occurred at 2:30 that morning, when Miss Callahan awakened, momentarily completely naked of ego, face to face with the subconscious, and sensing the inner self within.</td><td>回到家，似乎暂时停止了这稳步朝向扩散的进展。危机发生在当天凌晨两点半，卡拉汉小姐醒来时，瞬间完全裸露了自我，与潜意识面对面，感受到了内在的自己。</td></tr><tr><td>It was a moment of momentary (underlined) terror, as the ego realized that what it fought against and what it would continue, though ineffectually, to fight against, was indeed no enemy to it but a most familiar omnipresent inner self, against which it was now powerless.The ego returned but this was the first instant where it actually came face to face with its counterpart in essence and in fact.</td><td>它是一个瞬间的(划线)恐怖时刻，因为自我意识到，它所对抗的，以及它将继续对抗的，尽管是无效的，确实不是敌人，而是一个最熟悉的无所不在的内在自己，它现在无力对抗。自我返回了，但这是它在本质上和事实上，与它的对等物(counterpart)实际面对面的第一个瞬间。</td></tr><tr><td>The moments will reoccur, as Ruburt noticed Miss Callahan doodled upon a pad without any conscious knowledge of so doing, and without knowledge of what was written.The body becomes dependent upon old habitual patterns that will carry on yet for a while.That evening further blocks of actual brain cells were destroyed.The cooperation therefore begins to halt.</td><td>这种时刻还会重现，如鲁柏注意到的，卡拉汉小姐在笔记本上涂鸦，却没有意识到在这样做，也不知道写的是什么。身体变得依赖旧的习惯模式，这仍将持续一阵子。当天晚上，更多的脑细胞块坏死了。合作于此打住。</td></tr><tr><td>The second mention of the 23rd date was not a distortion. I tried to tie it in by mentioning that the date had already been given in connection with Miss Callahan.There was no distortion here again.</td><td>第二次提到23日这个日期，并不是扭曲，我试图通过，提及该日期已经与卡拉汉小姐有关，而把它联系)起来。这里也没有扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>What came through was correct, but my charming Ruburt merely blocked the rest.This is not nearly as troublesome basically as a distortion, though at times such blocking may leave you up in the air.The date did indeed refer to our young friend, who was taken ill that very evening.It would have done no good had the full data come through.If you had known what was to have happened, you could not have prevented it in any case.</td><td>传来的是正确的，但我迷人的鲁柏只不过把其余的资料都挡下来了。这基本上不像扭曲那么棘手，不过有时候，这种阻拦也许会让你们一头雾水。这个日期，的确是指我们那位当天晚上突然病倒的年轻朋友。就算资料完整传过来，也不会有什么帮助。如果你们早知道会发生什么事，也没有办法不让它发生。</td></tr><tr><td>The play is the thing, and so it was.The play in which your friend performed represented the springboard for the inner portrayal, unfortunately, of sacrifice.The caution that was given did come through, but of course you apparently thought that this applied to Miss Callahan.It implied instead caution against the possibility of conflict with your friend’s mother, and this could easily have occurred, to no good result in the long run.</td><td>那场戏是重点，确实如此。你们的朋友演出的那场戏代表的是，说来遗憾，牺牲的内在画面。给出的警告的确传过来了，但当然，你们显然认为，这是用在卡拉汉小姐身上。但它反而是暗示，要警惕你朋友和他母亲之间发生冲突的可能性，而这很容易发生，从长远来看，没有好结果。</td></tr><tr><td>It is really necessary that the young man get a dwelling place away from his family, and in one respect, the attack involving the lungs represented an attempt to put off responsibility.As such for a time it serves a good purpose.Other responsibilities in his profession were being put upon him, and this plus his intent to find his own apartment all weighed upon him, until he had to get out from under.</td><td>那位年轻人确实有必要搬离他的家，去另找一个住处，从某一方面来说，涉及肺部的发作，代表了想要卸下责任的企图。这一度起到很好的作用。在他的工作中，其他责任正压在他身上，再加上他打算寻找自己的公寓，所有这些都压在他身上，直到他不得不摆)脱困境。</td></tr><tr><td>He dared not fall sick until the final night of the play’s run, although the attack almost occurred just before the first night of the play.Ultimately he will have to get out on his own.It is almost necessary that he realize the way his mother is dominating him, and understand his own dependence.Otherwise he fights phantoms and uses up valuable energy that he now desperately needs.</td><td>在第一晚演出前，他就几乎发病了，但他一直到这部戏演出的最后一晚才敢生病。终究他得靠自己脱困。他几乎有必要意识到他母亲掌控他的方式，并了解他自己的依赖性。否则他只是与幻影战斗，消耗了他现在急需的宝贵能量。</td></tr><tr><td>I wanted to give you this material to clear up the misunderstanding.The two separate mentions of the same date did refer to two separate events that would occur on that same day.</td><td>我想要给你们这份资料来澄清误解。两次分别提到的同一日期，确实是指同一天会发生的两件不同的事件。</td></tr><tr><td>Distortions are now occurring less and less.A careful rereading of material will in such cases usually clear up such misunderstandings, as you will see when you reread the actual wording of the passage referred to.</td><td>扭曲现在发生得越来越少了。在这种情况下，仔细重读资料通常会理清这类误解，当你重读所提到的段落的实际措辞时，你会发现。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest now your first break.</td><td>我建议你们开始第一次的休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:29. Jane was pretty well dissociated for a first delivery. Earlier today, rereading the 54th session, page 90, she had made the intuitive connection that Seth's referral to the day May 23 twice did indeed refer to two separate events.At her suggestion I also reread the material; while agreeing that such an interpretation was possible, on my own I made no such connection, and thought that drawing such conclusions from the written word was stretching things a bit.I did believe that there was an explanation possible other than distortion however.</td><td>(9:29休息，这第一段传述，珍颇为解离，今天稍)早，她在重读第54节的时候，她直觉地认为，赛斯两)次提到5月23日这一天，确实是指两个不同的事件。在她的建议下，我也重读了资料；虽然同意那样的解读不无可能，但我自己并没有做出这样的关联，我认为光从字面意思就做出那样的结论有点牵强。不过我的确相信，除了扭曲之外，还有一种可能的解释。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane and I were pleased at Seth’s statement that no distortion did occur, but only a partial blocking. Jane is still very cautious where personal material is concerned. We feel that we can do little to speed up this process of eliminating distortions, as they occur.We have had no trouble that I am aware of in clearing up any distortions we ask Seth about after the event.</td><td>(对于赛斯说没有发生扭曲，而只是局部的阻挡，珍和我都很高兴，珍在涉及个人资料时，仍然非常谨慎，我们觉得，扭曲发生时，我们不太能做什么，来加快消除扭曲的过程。我觉察到，在事件发生后，我们向赛斯询问的任何扭曲情况，都能顺利理清。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed dictation in the same quiet manner at 9:35.)</td><td>(9:35，珍以同样平静的方式恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>My earlier remark that the weather affects your moods even as your moods affect the weather, is an important one.There is very much here to be explained.</td><td>我先前说到，天气会影响你们的心情，甚至你们的心情也会影响天气，这句话很重要。这里有非常多的东西需要解释。</td></tr><tr><td>Your weather indeed can be with some truth compared to loosely formed, mainly unconstructed energy, in many ways unbridled and uncontrolled by strong centralization of either subconscious or conscious control.</td><td>你们的天气在某些事实上，确实可以比作结构松散、大半未被建构的能量，在很多方面肆意妄为，不受潜)意识或意识的强烈集中控制。</td></tr><tr><td>The individual, for example, can to some extent for the purposes of our discussion be considered as elements or energy under psychic centralized control.On your plane you are in closed space, so to speak, physical elements formed into a purposeful gestalt.</td><td>例如，就我们讨论的目的而言，个体在某种程度上，可以被视为灵性集中控制下的元素或能量。在你们的层面上，你们处于一个封闭的空间，可以说，物质元素形成了一个有目的的完形。</td></tr><tr><td>Much other energy however, while observing certain inner rules, is not so directed and can be brought under the dominance therefore of purposeful directed gestalts.This of course occurs nevertheless on a subconscious level, representing a spilling over of emotional and psychic energy from self into what is usually considered not-self; and there are, constantly, effects that happen, a flowing back and forth of energy in this way.</td><td>然而，许多其他的能量，在遵守某些内在法则的同时，并不具有这样的指向性，可以被置于有目的的指向性完形的支配之下。当然，这仍是发生在潜意识的层面上，代表着情绪和灵性能量，从自己(self)溢出到通常被认为的非自己(not-self)；而且，不断有效应发生，能量以这种方式来回流动。</td></tr><tr><td>We will study these effects in a most detailed fashion at a later time because of their importance.This may sound unbelievable to you; nevertheless the same effects that cause emotional outbursts also cause physical storms.The basis is the same. The manifestation is different.The particles of air being themselves composed of molecular structures having, as all molecules do, a generalized sub-consciousness, and in condensed form a comprehension of the inner laws of the universe, are also then psychic as well as physical structures, as you should by now understand.</td><td>由于这些效应的重要性，我们将在以后的时间，以最详细的方式研究这些效应。这在你们听来也许难以置信；然而导致情绪爆发的同样效应，也会引起物理风暴。基础一样，表现形式不同。空气粒子本身是由分子结构组成，和所有的分子一样，有一个广泛性的潜意识，也有对宇宙内在法则的一个浓缩形式的理解，那么它也是灵性以及物质结构，你们现在应该明白)了。</td></tr><tr><td>Those that do not presently combine to form a complicated strong identity-pattern (hyphen) nevertheless still maintain the need for value fulfillment.By helping to form into charged emotional patterns, they share in a certain kind of awareness fulfillment otherwise denied to them.</td><td>那些目前还没有结合成复杂而强大的身份-模式(identity-pattern)(加连字符)的能量，仍然保有值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的需求。借由助成充满活力的情绪模式，它们分享了原本没有的某种意识的实现)</td></tr><tr><td>In their own way they become what we will call pure emotional constructions, forming patterns that operate through emotional impetus that is received from and transmitted by individuals who thereby discharge and yet direct excesses of emotional energy, which the various personalities can no longer hold within the personal domain.</td><td>们以自己的方式成为我们所说的纯粹的情绪结构，通过从个体那里接收和传递的情绪动力来运作，形成模式，从而释放且引导了过剩的情绪能量，各式人格已无法再容纳这些过剩的情绪能量在个人领域内。</td></tr><tr><td>This material is being delivered somewhat deliberately because of its possibly confusing nature.It is however extremely valid and important, and also represents an example of the manner in which surplus emotional energy is discharged and reused.In various ways this happens in many other fields.</td><td>由于这份资料可能令人困惑，所以这资料传送得有些谨慎。然而，它极有根据且重要，它也代表了一个例子，说明过剩的情绪能量被释放和重新使用的方式。这情况也以不同的方式发生在许多其他领域。</td></tr><tr><td>At the risk of telling you too much too soon, let me add further that when the molecular structures of so-called space are relatively emptied of emotional energy, by a process of psychic osmosis so to speak, they will tap the human source.And not only the human source but other animal sources as well.</td><td>冒着过早告诉你们的风险，我再补充一些，当所谓空间的分子结构，相对地清空了情绪能量时，通过一个可以说是灵性渗透(psychicosmosis)的过程，它们会汲)取人类资源(humansource)。而且不只是人类资源，还有其他的动物资源。</td></tr><tr><td>When you understand that basically all are one, and that in actuality there are no limitations between self and not-self, then these facts will not bother you.It also of course works the other way, so that when an individual feels energy- depleted, he does subconsciously, and by the same sort of process, drain off reserves from nonidentity molecular sources.</td><td>当你们了解，基本上万物一体，而且在自己与非自己之间其实没有限制时，这些事实就不会困扰你们。反过来当然也一样有用，当个体感觉能量耗尽时，他确实会下意识地，通过同样的那种过程，从非本体身份(nonidentity)的分子资源中耗掉储备。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:01.Jane was dissociated as usual.Her delivery of the above material had been very slow and deliberate.My hand so far felt no fatigue from writing.Jane resumed dictating in the same quiet manner at 10:09.)</td><td>(10:01休息。珍像往常一样解离。她传递上述资料的速度非常缓慢，而且很谨慎。写到目前为止，我的手还没感到累。珍以同样轻声细语的方式，在10:09继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>In many cases people know truths that they do not realize with the intellect.From time immemorial they have felt emotionally recharged from a storm, and this is of course exactly what happens.The process involved is a constant, necessary and beneficial give and take that results in at least some kind of balance.</td><td>在很多情况下，人们知道一些他们不是用智力来理解的真理。自古以来，他们就从风暴中感受到情绪的重振(emotionallyrecharged)，当然，这正是所发生的状况。所涉及的过程是一种持续、必要又有益的相互取予，其结果至少是某种平衡。</td></tr><tr><td>The emotional energy taken from individuals by nonidentity molecular structures is of course returned in a recharged and fresh fashion.Identity forms or personalities simply cannot handle great surpluses of energy at this time.Therefore the process mentioned indeed acts as an important safety valve.This cannot be stressed too much.</td><td>非本体身份的分子结构，从个体身上取得的情绪能量，当然会以一种重振且鲜活的方式返回。身份-形体)(Identity-forms)或人格这时根本无法处理巨大的剩余能量。因此，上述过程，确实扮演了一个重要的安全阀的作用。这一点再怎么强调都不为过。</td></tr><tr><td>There is an important relationship, then, between emotional energy and physical climate, and I hope to go into this more deeply.Much energy is used by any individual simply in the construction of the material universe on your plane.Excesses over this survival construction are used in various creative aspects, and represent the basics for culture and civilization.</td><td>那么，在情绪能量和物理气候之间有一个重要的关系，我希望更深入地谈一下这件事。任何个体都使用了大量的能量，仅仅是在你们的层面上建构物质宇宙。超出这个生存建构之外的多余能量，被用在各种不同的创造面向上，代表了文化和文明的基础。</td></tr><tr><td>Your wars are of course excess, poorly controlled emotional energy.In many cases you have been saved from wars by such things as earthquakes, tornadoes of a vast nature, and other physical catastrophes.It is not that your race has an instinct for destruction, although it does have what can really be called an instinct for manipulation.What seems to be a destructive instinct is instead an inability to control emotional energy, and to discharge it in a most effective manner.</td><td>你们的战争当然就是过剩、控制不当的情绪能量。在许多情况下，你们因为地震、大型的龙卷风、以及其他自然灾害等等之类的事件，而避免了战争的发生。这并不是说你们的族类有破坏的本能，但你们的族类的确有一种可称之为操控的本能。看起来像是破坏性的本能，其实是没有能力控制情绪能量，无法以最有效的方式释放它。</td></tr><tr><td>With your growing population it becomes more difficult to discharge this energy in what I would call natural ways; that is, by letting it spill over into the nonidentity molecular realm.Privation naturally leads to great aggression of feeling.Where there is great privation there will be a cruel climate, but the climate does not cause the privation.The emotional aggression caused by privation caused the climate.</td><td>随着你们的人口不断增加，用我所说的自然方式来释放这种能量，变得更加困难；也就是说，让它溢出到)非本体身份的分子领域。匮乏自然会导致情感的巨大侵略性。在极度匮乏的地方，就会有无情的气候，但不是气候造成匮乏。匮乏引起的情绪攻击造成了气候。</td></tr><tr><td>Weather goes in cycles, not because cycles are inherent in weather patterns, but because emotional cycles are inherent in individuals, and this also will be explained in time.</td><td>天气是有周期的，并不是因为周期是天气模式所固有，而是因为情绪周期是个体所固有，这一点随后就会解释。</td></tr><tr><td>Because of the fact that bad weather has often saved man from wars in the very early stages of human development, man misconstrued this to mean that sacrifice to the elements could save him from calamities of this kind.Sacrifice has nothing to do with it.You have heard doubtlessly of emotional contagion, and of emotional climate, and these terms are well named.Energy changes form constantly, and if it is blocked in one direction it will choose another.</td><td>因为在人类发展的早期阶段，恶劣的天气常常使人类免于战争，人类误解了这一点，以为向大自然献祭，可以使人类免于这种灾难。牺牲与此有关。你们无疑地听说过情绪传染(emotionalcontagion)，还有情绪气候(emotionalclimate)，这些名称取得恰恰好。能量不断改变形式，如果它在一个方向上受阻，就会选择另一个方向。</td></tr><tr><td>The Indian rain dances worked.Perhaps now you can understand the reason.Incidentally, if I may make a side note in response to a question you voiced, Joseph, during break: Loren was three times a man.</td><td>印弟安人的祈雨舞很管用。也许现在你们可以理解其原因了。顺带一提，约瑟，如果可以的话，让我做个旁注，回答一下你在休息时提出的问题：洛伦有三次是男人。</td></tr><tr><td>(Talking about distortions during last break, I had been reminded that many sessions ago Jane/Seth had stated first that [my brother] Loren had been three times a woman, then three times a man in a following session.I had never asked Seth to clear up the contradiction.)</td><td>(上一次休息时，我们讨论了扭曲，我想起了多节课之前，珍-赛斯先是说[我弟弟]曾三次是女人，然后在下一节又说三次是男人。我从未要求赛斯澄清这个矛盾。)</td></tr><tr><td>The misunderstanding seemed to amount to a distortion, but was not to this effect.Oftentimes when a person is reincarnated continually as one sex, the overall impression of the personality seems to be of the opposite sex.Ruburt picked up the feeling of femaleness very strongly here.</td><td>误解似乎相当于一种扭曲，但不是这个意思。往往，当一个人不断以同一种性别转世的时候，这个人格的整体印象似乎会是相反的性别。鲁伯在这里强烈地接收到了非常女性化的感觉。</td></tr><tr><td>(See the 10th session, page 48, and the 12th session, page 59, in Vol. One.)</td><td>(参见第一册第10节、第12节。)</td></tr><tr><td>As in many cases an old man will appear womanish, so a personality reincarnated steadily as a male will develop strong and overly compensated for female characteristics, as is the case with Loren in this existence.The very fact that the personality evades a female reincarnation is evidence of an already developed fear.The personality of Loren, you see, is basically female despite the fact that he has never had a female reincarnation.This led to the confusion.</td><td>就像在很多情况下，一个老男人会显得像女人一样，所以一个稳稳地转世为男性的人格，也会发展出强烈的、过度补偿的女性特质，洛伦这一世的存在就是这种情形。这个人格回避转世成为女性的这个事实本身，就证明了已经形成的恐惧。你看，洛伦的人格基本上是女性的，尽管他从没有过女性的转世。这就导致了混乱。</td></tr><tr><td>It goes without saying that upon your plane male and female are equally important, although because of the plane's particular overemphasis upon aggressive manipulation the male has thus far dominated.</td><td>不言而喻，在你们的层面，男性和女性是同等重要，由于这个层面特别强调侵略性的操纵，到目前为止，男性一直占主导地位。</td></tr><tr><td>There is also much here to be explained, since your conception of male and female is greatly distorted.The terms are of course reflections, in your plane, of other basic inner laws of the universe which we have yet to discuss.They have actually very little to do with what you consider male and female, and for now we can mention them briefly in terms of arrival and departure.</td><td>这里还有许多需要解释的地方，因为你们对男性和女性的概念被大大扭曲了。当然，这些名词在你们的层面上，是对我们尚未讨论的宇宙其他基本内在法则的反映。它们其实与你们认为的男性与女性，关系不大，现在我们可以从到来和离去(arrivalanddeparture)的角度来稍微提一下。</td></tr><tr><td>I will go into this at a later date, as you are not ready for this material as yet.Needless to say, the use of energy, and of emotional energy in particular, varies in the male and female on your plane; and both methods of using and discharging energy are necessary to maintain not only psychic and emotional balance, but also to maintain physical balance as far as living things are concerned, and also in the counterbalancing effects within weather and nature as it exists in your physical universe.</td><td>我以后再谈这件事，因为你们还不到理解这份资料的时候。不用说，在你们这个层面，男性和女性对能量的运用是不同的，尤其是对情绪能量的运用；使用和释放能量这两种方法都是必要的，不仅是为了维持灵性和情绪的平衡，而且就生物而言，也是为了维持身体的平衡，同时也是为了在天气和自然界中的制衡作用，因为它存在于你们的物质宇宙中。</td></tr><tr><td>It is necessary upon your plane that physical constructions arrive and depart.The departure is as necessary as the arrival, for without it new arrivals of any kind would not be possible.</td><td>在你们的层面上，物质建构的来去是必要的。离去和到来一样必要，因为没有离去，就不可能有任何新的到来。</td></tr><tr><td>It is no coincidence that man the hunter seems, at least, to destroy.But this destructiveness in itself serves the purposes of creativeness and arrival.Both are merely faces of the same coin.I am not here saying that all destruction is good, by any means.I am saying that the basic structure involving the constant conception of one life form by another serves the purposes of continuing creation.</td><td>人，这猎人，至少似乎是在破坏，这并不是巧合。但这个破坏本身起到了创造与到来(arrival)的目的。两者)不过是同一枚硬币的两面。我在这里并不是说所有的破坏都是好的。我在说的是，涉及到一个生命形式不断地被另一个生命形式所孕育的基本结构，起到了持续创造的目的。</td></tr><tr><td>When it is followed without the addition of unrestrained and purposely cruel purposes having nothing to do with the basic necessity, arrival and departure then can be seen as the two faces of male and female, each serving the basic purpose of value fulfillment and creation.</td><td>当它被遵循而不加入与基本需要无关的无节制和蓄意残酷的目的时，来到与离去就可以被看成是男性和女性这两面，各自服务于值的充盈(valuefulfillment)与创造的基本目的。</td></tr><tr><td>This will be tied in, with details, to weather in a very intimate fashion.This is far afield from Loren, and yet it is not.Other contradictions will be cleared up as you bring them up.Loren must have a female reincarnation, even to give validity to his masculinity.</td><td>这将会带着细节，以非常紧密的方式与天气联系在一起。这看似与洛伦扯不上关系，但并非如此。其他的矛盾也会随着你们对问题的提出而被澄清。罗伦必须有一个女性的转世，甚至为了让他的阳刚之气有效，罗伦也必须有一个女性的转世。</td></tr><tr><td>As all living things on your plane cooperate to form your physical universe, so therefore do they cooperate to form not only your weather cycles, but your climate cycles in terms of ice ages and tropical

He can keep it but he cannot keep it.He can hold it as his own, and yet he cannot prevent it from passing on to others, though he presses his lips tightly and does not speak it aloud.</td><td>因此，一个思想，肯定是自己最亲密的拥有之一，它并不停留在自己之内。思想属于个体，它从个体的心智中跃出，但个体并不真正拥有它，他可以保留它，但他不能留住它。他可以把它当作是自己的，但就算他紧闭双唇，不大声说出来，也阻止不了它传给别人。</td></tr><tr><td>An individual or a self also cannot hide from others his own basic intent.It is his and yet, though he possesses it, he still cannot prevent others from sensing it.Along these lines there is much to be said in that many intangibles, considered most secret by the self, do not remain within the self.No skin or bones or skeletal cage can keep the thought of the self from going outward.</td><td>一个"个体"或一个"自己"无法对别人隐藏他自己的基本意图。意图是他的，然而，虽然他拥有它，但他仍然无法阻止别人感觉到它。在这方面有很多东西可以说，许多无形的东西，被自己认为是最秘密的，并没有留在自己之内。没有皮肤，骨骼或骨架的笼子可以阻止自己的思想向外露出。</td></tr><tr><td>The skin and bone, being physical, are adequate barriers to bound other material, but they have no hold over what is not material.A man’s intent is subconsciously sensed by everyone with whom he comes in contact.Telepathy accounts for the usefulness of spoken language.Without telepathy no language would be intelligible.The outward layer of skin, while serving as a physical enclosure, serves as a physical enclosure only for the sake of convenience, as far as distinctions are concerned.</td><td>皮肤和骨骼作为物质，足以成为束缚其他物质的屏障，但是它们扣留不住非物质的东西。一个人的意图会被每一个与他接触的人下意识地感应到。言语因心灵感应而有效用。没有心灵感应，语言就无法被理解。皮肤的外层，作为一个身体的外壳，只是为了区别，为了方便，才充当了身体的围墙。</td></tr><tr><td>In actuality the outer layer of skin is a flimsy boundary indeed.It is more open than closed.It is only to your own outer senses that the skin seems smooth.It is indeed more a loose open framework, through which constantly chemicals, nutrients, molecules, elements, light, sound and pulsations pass frequently, constantly both in and out.</td><td>实际上，皮肤的外层确实是一个单薄的边界。它的开放性大于封闭性。只是对你们自己的外在感官而言，皮肤才显得平滑。它的确更像是一个松散开放的框架，透过它，化学物、营养物、分子、元素、光线、声音和脉动不断地频繁进出。</td></tr><tr><td>Therefore speaking in physical terms only, the self is not bounded.It is not independent nor self-contained.It needs for its survival nutrients that come from outside of the skin.Not only this, but in all cases its own excretions are needed for nourishment of what is not-self, or by what seems to be not-self.</td><td>因此仅从物质角度讲，自己是没有界限的。它既不独立，也不自给自足。它的生存需要来自皮肤之外的营养物质。不仅如此，在所有的情况下，它自己的排泄物需要用于滋养非自己(not-self)，或被似乎是非自己所需要。</td></tr><tr><td>This will be a lengthy discussion, and I suggest that you take your break.Be careful of what you do with the pieces.</td><td>这会是一场冗长的讨论，我建议你休息(break)一下。小心你对碎片(pieces)的处理。(译注：赛斯又在玩break,pieces的相关文字游戏)</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:28.

self.</td><td>没有任何灵性行动是静态的。这些次要人格不能被称为全面的自己(fullselves)，但它们当然也不能被当作所谓的非自己搁一边。它们透过梦境，透过诱使主要人格有时采用通常不会采纳的有意识或无意识的想法，因此，而有时会改变主要人格的历程，而变得有些突显和充实。</td></tr><tr><td>Now again, no psychic action is

dream worldd operates within the dimensions of your own psychic field, but utterly divorced from both space-time continuum and physical construction.Here you see the self truly spills over, not only into what you would call not-self, but into areas with which the conscious self is barely familiar.On an unconscious level however the self is very aware of the progress of these secondary personalities, and indeed uses this plane itself for the fulfillment and development of qualities originally attached to it, but incompatible with its main intents.The two planes constantly enrich and affect each other.</td><td>这是极其重要的，因为梦世界在你们自己的灵性领域维度内运作，又与时空的连续性和物质结构彻底脱离。在这里，你们可以看到自己真的溢出来了，不仅流入你们所谓的非自己，也流入有意识的自己几乎不熟悉的领域。然而，在无意识的层面上，自己非常清楚这些次要人格的进展，事实上，它利用这个层面本身来实现和发展原本附属于它，但与它的主要意图不相容的品质。这两个层面持续不断地增益彼此、互相影响。</td></tr><tr><td>I

its own inner and initial consciousness, then you will see that we have come full circle.The individual or the self is all important.It operates to form as complicated a gestalt as possible, following the law of value fulfillment, and yet in so doing it does not either invade, deny or negate other individual consciousness.It is limitless because there are no limits to the possibilities of its value fulfillment, or to the number of gestalts which it can form.</td><td>如果你们终于明白，每一个物质粒子都包含它自己的内在和初始意识，那么，你们就会看到，我们绕了一圈回到了原地。个体或自己非常重要。它遵循值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的法则不断运作，形成尽可能复杂的完形，然而在这样做的过程中，它既不侵犯，也不否认或否定其他个体的意识。它是没有限制的，因为它的值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的可能性是无限的，或它能够形成的完形数量也是无限的。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, you should see from this that your universe is therefore itself a gestalt.As an individual cell can be considered to be apart from the rest of the body, as its outer rim can be considered as something that divides it from the rest of the body, so the self can be considered as apart from the universe, and its outer skin thought of as dividing it from the rest of the body.</td><td>现在，你们应该从中看出，你们的宇宙本身就是一个完形。当单个细胞可以被认为是与身体其他部分分离的，当它的外缘可以被认为是隔开它与身体其余部分的东西，那么自己也可以被认为是与宇宙分离的，而外部的皮肤也可以被想成是隔开了它与身体的其他部分。</td></tr><tr><td>However, as we know the cell is a part of the body, giving nourishment and receiving nourishment from it.Its outer rim, more correctly, connects it to the body.Parts of it literally travel throughout the body.It is yet an individual.It possesses condensed consciousness and comprehension, it partakes of value fulfillments through the gestalt of which it would not otherwise be capable.If you considered the body as a closed system, which it is not, then you could say that the self of the cell had as its limitations only the limits of the whole closed system.But the system is not closed, and through the participation of the cell in the activities of the body, which is an open system, then you could truly say that the cell itself had no limitations.</td><td>然而，我们知道细胞是身体的一部分，给予身体养分，也从身体得到养分。更正确地说，它的外缘连结它和身体。它的各个部分名副其实行遍全身。但它仍是一个个体。它拥有浓缩的意识和理解力，它经由完形参与了值的充盈(valuefulfillment)，否则它就没有能力实现。如果你把身体看作是一个封闭的系统，它并不是，那么你们可以说，细胞自己有的局限，只在整个封闭系统内的限制而已。但是这个系统并不封闭，通过细胞参与身体的活动，而身体是一个开放系统，那么你们就可以真正地说，细胞本身没有局限性。</td></tr><tr><td>The gradations, I admit, are extremely gentle.Nevertheless the end result of each gradation brings us to the conclusion that the self, while being individual because of its inner counterpart or inner self, is unlimited.Yet no invasion occurs.</td><td>我承认，这些渐变，是极其和缓的。然而，每个渐变的最终结果，都会让我们得出结论：自己，虽然因为其内在的对等物，或内在的自己而成为个体，但却是无限的。然而，没有发生入侵。</td></tr><tr><td>I hope this has not been too difficult, and I

classes at the gallery is a good one.I have not had the opportunity to go into her Mrs. Masters but I shall do so.The salesman’s ability of Ruburt’s will serve him well in the children’s classes.I am rather surprised that he and his Mrs. Masters have managed to get along as well as they have.I would caution him to be very calm at the gallery during the next two weeks.And now good evening.</td><td>再一次，容我说一句，我会时不时地来探望你们。鲁柏想在画廊开一个儿童班是个好主意。我一直没有机会谈谈她的马斯特斯太太，但我会的。鲁柏的推销员能力将在儿童班上得到很好的发挥。我相当惊讶，他和马斯特斯太太居然能够相处得这么好。我想提醒他)在接下来的两个星期里，在画廊里要非常冷静。现在，晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth.

the desired state I then fell asleep.In a short time I was awakened by a child’s voice speaking briefly but loudly in my right ear.Just before coming awake I had a brief impression of a man and a boy at a table or bench, upon which were some model trains.Loren and Dougie?If so I did not recognize them, nor understand what the boy said.On this day Jane and I sent Linda a graduation present.[She and Dougie are Lorens children.]</td><td>(5月29日，星期五，下午3:30：在快要达到所需要的状态时，我就睡着了。没多久就被一个孩子的声音吵醒，在我的右耳边，简短而响亮。就在醒来之前，我有个短暂的印象，是一个男人和一个男孩坐在桌子或长凳旁，上面有些模型火车。是洛伦和道基吗？如果是，我并没有认出他们，也不明白那个男孩说了什么。这一天，我和珍给琳达寄了一份毕业礼物。[她和道基是洛伦的孩子。](Mon.6/1:Missed.)</td></tr><tr><td>(Sat. 5/30, 8:00 PM: Experienced my sensation at suggestion of lightness in the desired state.Telling myself I would visit Ed and Ella, I then glimpsed a teenage girl talking on the telephone.I did not recognize her.Her brown hair was pulled back; she was sitting on a straight chair beside a small table, holding phone in left hand, wearing dungarees.Full figure 3/4 front view.No lipstick; lips were parted as though she was caught in speech.Brief though a small amount of duration.</td><td>(5月30日，星期六，晚上8:00：在所需的状态中，经历了我暗示的轻松感。告诉自己我会去看埃德和艾拉，然后瞥见一位少女在讲电话。我不认识她。她的棕色头发向后梳着；她坐在一张小桌旁的直背椅上，左手拿着话筒，穿着吊带牛仔裤。看到正面全身的四分之三。没有擦口红；嘴唇张着好像正在讲话。虽然短暂，但持续了一小段时间。</td></tr><tr><td>(I then had repeated glimpses of a silhouetted male figure seen from the back, wearing a pointed helmet and a greatcoat, such as perhaps German officers wore in the past.The right hand held a club or truncheon; the right arm rose and fell regularly, although the rhythm was not rapid.I could not see what if anything the figure was striking.This experience had some duration.</td><td>(然后我重复地看到一个男人的背面身影，头戴尖头盔，身穿大衣，可能就像过去德国军官的穿着。右手举着一个球棒或是警棍；右手臂上下摆动，但节奏不快。我看不出这个身影是否在打什么东西。这个经历持续了一段时间。</td></tr><tr><td>(Sun. 5/31, 9:00 PM: Few instances of sensation.My lower legs

said, of the subject matter for the session but promptly forgot it upon awakening.All was quiet, no witnesses appearing.Jane was nervous as usual before the session began.She began dictating in a rather quiet voice, at a brisk pace, and maintained this attitude more or less for the whole session.Her eyes darkened as usual.)</td><td>(8:50，珍从小睡中醒来。在睡觉时，她对这次课程的主题有一个想法，但一醒来就忘了。一切回归安静，没有证人。珍和往常一样在课程开始之前紧张。她相当轻声的传述，步履轻快，整节课一直维持这个状态，眼睛变黑如常。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening,

minutes, and I would not at all be surprised, Joseph, to find that he continues in the same hilarious fashion as times goes by.It is in his nature.</td><td>我一直觉得你们在上课前的对话很有趣。鲁柏的小动作，比如看一看时钟的指针分秒过去，没有一次不逗我发笑，约瑟，随着时间的过去，他还是继续这好笑的举动，我是一点也不惊讶。这是他的天性。</td></tr><tr><td>The caution and ego strength behind such amusing episodes work to our benefit, however.He has used them well this time, to give himself added discipline, and this is all to the good.Without this ego elasticity, that is without the ability of the ego to assume control and to guide Ruburt back, immediately reassuming control, we would be in for much less peaceful sessions, and the quantity and quality of the overall material would suffer.I certainly would not want to get him angry at me. as I am so familiar with his explosive reactions.</td><td>不过，这种有趣的情节背后的谨慎和自我的力量，对我们是有利的。他这次用得很好，给了自己额外的纪律，这些都是好事。如果没有这种自我的弹性，也就是说，没有自我的这种承担控制、并把鲁伯引导回来、立即恢复控制的能力，我们的课就不会那么平)静，整个资料的质与量也都会受损。我当然不想让他对我发火，因为我太熟悉他的火爆反应。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here, Jane's voice became very light and amused.)</td><td>(这里，珍的声音变得很轻松快活。)</td></tr><tr><td>As far as self and not-self are concerned, the unit of self is organized, as you know, by the inner ego, which directs the whole energy field.The outer ego directs the manipulation of this gestalt in the physical universe.The outer ego is rather more tied to physical properties, and yet it can directly experience inner reality by a change of focus through aligning itself with the inner ego, focusing its energies with the inner rather than the outer senses.This is by far the most advantageous method of experiencing inner reality, because the outer ego is therefore consciously aware of what has been going on, and can use such knowledge in its own sphere.</td><td>就自己和非自己而言，正如你所知，自己(self)这个单位是由内在自我(innerego)组织的，内在自我指挥着整个能量场。外在自我指挥这个完形在物质宇宙中的操纵。外在自我与物质属性的关系更紧密，然而它可以通过改变焦点来直接体验内在实相，通过与内在自我相一致，用内在的而不是外在的感官聚焦它的能量。这是迄今为止体验内在实相最有利的方法，因为外在自我因此有意识地觉察到所发生的事情，并且可以在自己的领域中使用这种知识。</td></tr><tr><td>When the inner ego and the outer ego pursue directly opposed viewpoints and different aims and goals, then you run into difficulty.In studying human personality and the psyche, your psychologists have not gone far, nor deeply enough.When a complete barrier, or nearly complete barrier, exists between the inner and outer egos, then the whole self is denied value fulfillment to a large degree.Such a division occurs at various times in history, and is occurring now.</td><td>当内在自我与外在自我追求完全相反的观点，以及不同目的和目标时，你们就遇到困难了。在研究人类的人格和心灵上，你们的心理学家走得不远，也不够深。当内在自我和外在自我之间存在着完全的障碍，或近乎完全的障碍时，那么整体自己(wholeself)就会在很大程度上被剥夺了值的充盈(valuefulfillment)。这)样的分裂在历史上发生过好几次，目前也正在发生。</td></tr><tr><td>When the two are in balance and when there is communication between them, then the inner ego can directly communicate with the outer ego, bring to it the necessary enlightenments, and give it, that is give the outer ego the benefit of its own, the inner ego’s own, condensed comprehension and direct participation in the existence of the universe as a whole.</td><td>当二者处于平衡状态时，当二者之间有交流时，那么内在自我就能直接与外在自我沟通，给它带来必要的启迪，并给它，也就是给外在自我以它自己的利益，亦即内在自我自己的浓缩理解力，以及作为一个整体直接参与宇宙的存在。</td></tr><tr><td>The outer ego, under such advantageous circumstances, is more nearly able also to communicate its experience in the physical world to the inner self, and hereby to actually help enlarge the inner self, which then directly experiences stimulation and manipulations in a camouflage pattern which is otherwise denied to it.</td><td>外在自我在这样有利的状况下，也几乎比较有能力把它在物质世界的经验传达给内在自己，并由此实际帮助扩展了内在自己，从而使内在自己得以直接经历它在伪装模式中，唯有如此，才能体验得到的刺激和操纵。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner self obviously needs the outer ego with its outer senses, in order to permit its own materialization in various camouflage forms.This should not be underrated or forgotten.Without the outer core, the inner self could simply not add to its own value fulfillment through participation in energy-constructs (hyphen).</td><td>内在的自己显然需要外在自我连同它的外在感官，以便允许它自己以各种伪装形态具体化。这一点不应该被低估或忘记。若没有外在的核心，内在自己根本无法借着参与能量-建构(energy-constructs加连字符)来增益它自己的值(valuefulfillment)。</td></tr><tr><td>Each existence in any of many camouflage patterns trains and fulfills the inner self to develop the greatest possible fulfillment of its own qualities and characteristics.These inherent qualities and characteristics determine the planes upon which the inner self will exist, and on each plane a certain materialization is necessary.It will vary according to the properties of the plane.</td><td>在众多伪装模式的任何一个存在，都会训练并丰盈内在自己，以使其自身的品质与特性得到最大可能的实现。这些固有的品质与特性，决定了内在自己将存在的层面，而在每个层面上，一定程度的具体化是必要的。它将根据层面的属性而有所不同。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true that the inner self in the last analysis is the durable self.Nevertheless the various outer egos are extremely important, and without them the inner self would be blocked.Nor are these inner abilities as a rule ever left unfulfilled.The outer egos are not gobbled up, so to speak, after a particular existence, but remain in control of those characteristics and abilities which they have been so important in forming and training.</td><td>的确，从最后的分析来看，内在的自己才是持久的自己(durableself)。然而，各种外在自我也是极其重要的，没有它们，内在自己就会被阻隔。作为一个法则，这些内在能力也无从实现。这么说吧，在一次特定的存在之后，外在自我并没有被吞噬，它仍然控制着那些它们在形成和训练中非常重要的特性和能力。</td></tr><tr><td>The outer ego then remains at the end a controller and director of those strengths which it gathered about itself during its particular existence.But even this is not the end.It, that is it meaning the outer ego, can even continue growth and development after a particular existence, according to its inherent ability and according to its ability to communicate with the basic inner self.</td><td>最后，外在自我仍然是它在其特定存在期间收集的那些力量的控制者和指挥者。但甚至这也不是终点。它，也就是外在自我，根据其固有的能力和与基本内在自己沟通的能力，甚至可以在一个特定的存在之后，继续成长和发展。</td></tr><tr><td>This is extremely difficult, I should imagine.Nevertheless, even when an inner self has sent out a new outer ego upon a new camouflage venture, the previous ego is still afforded an almost unlimited avenue for development.There are many possibilities for it.It can choose to remain what it is, one ego.It will then remain in a somewhat subordinate position to the inner self, but in no more of a subordinate position than it was earlier.</td><td>我可以想像，这是极其困难的。不过，即使内在自己送出了一个新的外在自我去进行一个新的伪装冒险，先前的自我还是有几近无限的发展途径。它有许多可能性。它可以选择保持它之所是，一个自我。然后，它会保持在某种程度上从属于内在自己的位置，但不会是比它先前更从属的地位。</td></tr><tr><td>It will therefore return once more to the same plane with which it was familiar, where it will meet with new challenges, and develop new abilities that will, however, be of the same basic nature; that is, if we are speaking of your plane, the ego would have new experiences, develop new abilities, perhaps solve old problems, balance out deficiencies, but still be dealing with problems of manipulation and physical construction.</td><td>因此，它将再次回到它所熟悉的同一层面，在那里，它会遇到新的挑战，并发展出新的能力，然而，这些能力将具有相同的基本性质；也就是说，如果我们说的是你们的层面，自我会有新的经验，发展新的能力，也许解决老问题，弥补不足之处，但仍然是在处理和操纵物质建构的问题。</td></tr><tr><td>Most egos do indeed choose this course for a while.For that matter the requirements of your plane itself necessitate the fulfillment of certain developments such as those we have mentioned much earlier, having to do with the experience of a full childhood, motherhood, fatherhood, et cetera.These represent minimum requirements for your plane.</td><td>大部分的自我的确会有一段时间选择这条路。就此而言，你们层面本身的要求，必须满足某些发展，比如我们前面提到的，有一个完整的童年，母亲，父亲的经验，等等。这些都代表了你们层面的最低要求。</td></tr><tr><td>The ego may also have particular desires of its own along these lines.Now you will see what I am saying.In various reincarnations upon your plane, the ego that reincarnates is the same ego.The information of past lives is retained by that ego’s subconscious, for obvious reasons.But this information can be tapped.</td><td>自我在这些方面可能也会有它特定的渴望。现在你们会明白我在说什么。在你们层面的各个转世中，转世的自我是同一个自我。过去生命的资料被那自我的潜意识所保留，原因很明显。但这个资料可以被挖掘出)来。</td></tr><tr><td>Theoretically such an ego could continue reincarnating indefinitely in such a fashion, always growing and developing, but always dealing with problems of manipulation and physical construction of energy.This then represents one possibility for growth of any particular ego.There are other possibilities—</td><td>理论上，这样一个自我可以继续无限期地以这样的方式转世，总是在成长和发展，但也总是在处理能量的操纵和物质建构的问题。那么，这代表了任何特定自己成长的一种可能性。还有其他的可能性——</td></tr><tr><td>Do forgive me. I had forgotten your break.By all means take it, and before the night is over really, I will have to remember to give you an example of my peculiar brand of humor, since you look so serious, Joseph.</td><td>请见谅，我忘了你们的休息时间。好好休息一下吧，在今晚结束之前，我得记得给你举个例子，一个我独特品牌的幽默例子，因为你看起来很严肃，约瑟。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:41.Jane was again fully dissociated for a first break.This appears to be the rule now.I was aware that we had run past first break, since my hand was beginning to get weary; Jane's delivery had also speeded up.</td><td>(9:41休息。珍再次在第一次休息时就完全解离。现在这显然已经变成常态。我知道，我们错过了休息时间，因为我的手已经开始疲乏了；珍的传讯速度也加快了。</td></tr><tr><td>(She began dictating again in a much stronger voice, but this phenomenon did not last very long, perhaps for the following page; her voice then returned to its quiet rather rapid pace.Resume at 9:47.)</td><td>(她以更有力的声音再次开始传述，但这个现象并没有持续太久，也许只到下面一页；然后她的声音恢复到轻声且快速的节奏。9:47继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now if there is good communication between the self, that is the inner self and the outer ego, then the ego begins to understand what it is, and also to realize that it has greater capacities than it can realize by continued reincarnations, upon one plane.</td><td>现在，如果自己之间，也就是内在自己和外在自我之间有良好的沟通，那么自我就会开始了解它是什么，</td></tr><tr><td>If the ego is exceptional it may take one of two courses.</td><td>也会意识到它有更大的能力，比它在单一层面持续转世所能实现的还要大。</td></tr><tr><td>It may choose to return to the same plane as a great originator, using knowledge that it receives from the inner self to make lasting and original innovations upon that plane, according to its interests, abilities and capacity.It will therefore become a Buddha, a Christ, a Michelangelo, a hero in one field or another, an ego who changes the physical world completely in untold manners by the mere fact of its existence.</td><td>如果自我非比寻常，可能会采取两种方式之一。它可以选择回到同一个层面，当一名伟大的鼻祖)(originator)，利用从内在自己那里获得的知识，根据自己的兴趣、才干和实力，在那个层面上进行持久的原创的创新。因此，它将成为佛陀、基督、米开朗基罗，成为某个领域的英雄，成为仅仅因为它的存在，就以难以计数的方式，彻底改变物质世界的自我。</td></tr><tr><td>It then does not reincarnate again upon that plane.However because of its own extraordinary nature, it itself forms with the inner self in an added gestalt, adding to the energy and ability of the inner self; and in a manner which I cannot yet explain to you, it voluntarily may give up its ego identification to a large degree for the purpose of giving its full energies to the store of the inner self.</td><td>然后，它不再转世到那个层面。然而由于它自己的非凡本质，它本身与内在自己形成了一个新增的完形，增加了内在自己的能量和能力；并以一种我还不能向你们解释的方式，它可能自愿放弃它的自我身份到一个很大的程度，以便把它全部的能量交给内在自己的库存。</td></tr><tr><td>That is one possibility.It is followed by egos who have actually worn out not this energy, which is tremendous, but their desires.</td><td>那是一种可能性。这么做，自我实际上耗尽的其实不是能量，因为能量多到惊人，而是它们的欲望。</td></tr><tr><td>Other egos choose instead to become entities of their own, in which case this magnificent outer ego becomes in turn an inner ego, which then from its own unfulfilled desires, abilities and initiatives are formed new outer egos which once again seek fulfillment.</td><td>其他的自我则选择成为它们自己的存有，在这种例子里，这杰出的外在自我，转而成为一个内在自我，然后从它自己未被满足的欲望、能力和主动性，形成许多新的外在自我，再度寻求满足。</td></tr><tr><td>Such an outer ego turned inner ego, has only experienced existence then upon a particular plane.It is therefore filled with impatience as far as existence upon other planes are concerned; and therefore if it developed upon your plane initially, it will not choose to initiate anew there, but will choose other planes of activity.</td><td>这样一个转为内在自我的外在自我，只在一个特定层面上体验过存在。所以对于其他层面的存在，它充满迫不急待的感觉；所以如果它一开始是在你们的层面发展，那它不会选择在你们的层面重新开始，而会选择其他的活动层面。</td></tr><tr><td>It does therefore contain within it the knowledge of its experiences upon your plane, though such an entity can spring from any plane.This of course represents the most extraordinary possibility, and such an entity can, if it is so propelled by its own strength, exist upon a variety of planes, carrying along with it knowledge of all previous planes; and each of its outer egos have the same opportunities.This is important.</td><td>因此，它确实包含了它在你们的层面上的经验知识，虽然这样一个存有可以从任何层面跳出。当然，这代表了最非凡的可能性，这样的一个存有，如果它被自己的力量所驱策，可以存在于各种层面，带着先前所有层面的知识；并且它的每一个外在自我都有相同的机会。这一点很重要。</td></tr><tr><td>The choice is always made by the particular ego, and we are speaking here of outer egos, remember.Many are content to continue indefinitely along the same plane, having almost endless incarnations and in contact more or less with the inner self.</td><td>选择总是由那特定的自我做出，请记住，我们这里说的是外在自我。许多外在自我满足于在同一个层面无限期地转世下去，有几乎无止尽的化身，并多多少少)与内在自己维持联系。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt and myself were offshoots of the same entity, as I have mentioned.I will mention now that we have chosen the same paths.The difference in time is but a camouflage distortion.The entity was a particularly strong one, and many of its egos have made the decision to turn into entities.</td><td>我说过，鲁柏和我是同一个存有的分支。我现在要说的是，我们选择了同一条路。时间上的差异只不过是一种伪装的扭曲。这个存有特别强大，它的很多自我都决定转变为存有。</td></tr><tr><td>There are certain requirements as you remember that must be met, upon your plane and upon others.Yet an ego, an outer ego, cannot choose to be an entity in any case until its comprehension attains a certain degree.And now, my dear patient Joseph, may I tell you also that you are part of that same entity; and this is one of the main reasons why I am able to communicate with you both.</td><td>如你所记得的，在你们的层面或其他层面，有某些要求必须被满足。然而，一个自我，一个外在自我，在任何情况下都不能选择成为一个存有，直到它达到相当程度的理解。现在，我亲爱的、有耐心的约瑟，我可以告诉你，你也是那同一个存有的一部分；这也是我能够和你们两位沟通的主要原因之一。</td></tr><tr><td>This particular set of circumstances does not happen often.I have wanted to make this clear for quite a while but you would not have understood it much earlier.You and Ruburt both must use all your abilities to the utmost.You will find more energy at your disposal as you use it for this purpose.This is extremely important, since this is the existence in which you are to make your largest contribution.</td><td>这一套特殊的情况并不经常发生。我早就想把这一点说清楚了，但太早的话，你还不会理解。你和鲁伯都必须将你们的所有能力发挥到极致。当你把能量用在这个目的时，你会发现你可以支配更多的能量。这一点极为重要，因为这就是你们要做出最大贡献的存在。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here, Jane held her hands out to me, indicating that they were "fat.

and its depth can be understood not in terms of downward action, but perhaps you can comprehend it if you think of a deep trance, for example, as definitely having motion, though the body may be motionless.</td><td>这是真正的移动，或灵性动态的例子。现在，这个品质，可以说代替了你们的空间和时间，这个品质-深度(Quality-depth)，代表了这种灵性移动(psychictraveling)或灵性动态(psychicmotion)，或任何灵性行动(psychicaction)发生的前景展望(perspective)；它的深度可以不从向下行动的角度来理解，但如果你们把深度出神，比方说，想成肯定有动静，但身体可能一动也不动，也许你们就能理解了。</td></tr><tr><td>But in a trance depth, as in Quality-depth, the motion has a direction that cannot be thought of in terms of up or down, north or south, east or west.The motion is action through quality or value dimension.I have been meaning to speak about this.It could easily be called the inner extension of your psychological time, so you will see its importance.</td><td>但是在一个出神的深度里，就像在品质-深度中，动态有它的方向，但不能用上下、南北、东西的方向来想。这个动态是透过品质，或值的维度(valuedimension)的行动。我一直想谈谈这个题目。它大可以)被称为你们心理时间的内在延伸，这样你们就会看到它的重要性。</td></tr><tr><td>Psychological time indeed involves you in the initial venturing.It is like an outer rim.This Quality-depth is our only true perspective.Again, no intervals are involved.I find difficulty in choosing words evocative for my meaning.</td><td>心理时间确实涉及到你们最初的冒险。它就像个外在边缘。这品质-深度是我们唯一真实的展望视角。同样的，不涉及任何间隔。我发现很难为我的意思找到传神的词语。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27.Again for a first break, Jane was fully dissociated.She knew that she was dictating very slowly, she said, yet she was not groping.She felt Seth was searching her vocabulary in order to express himself as best he could.Here she thought that Seth was dealing with a concept that was not suited for expression in words, nor was it meant to be expressed in words.Jane felt that what came through was close enough but still left a lot to be desired.</td><td>(9:27休息。再次，珍完全解离了。她说，她知道，她传述的速度很慢，但她并没有在摸索什么。她觉得赛斯在搜索她的词汇，以便能尽可能地表达他自己的意思。她认为赛斯正在处理一个不适合用语言表达的概念，而这概念也不是要用语言来表达的。珍觉得传述过来的东西已经很接近了，但还是有很多不足之处。</td></tr><tr><td>(She resumed in the same deliberate and quiet manner at 9:31.)</td><td>(9:31，她以同样慎重和安静的方式恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>Quality-depth is therefore the perspective in which all psychic actions occur, all ideas and universes expand.This expansion occurs in infinite dimensions, as perhaps it could be said that an apple develops about its core;

"</td><td>(到了晚上8:50，珍已经不是特别紧张了，不过因为画廊的变化，她一直有些不安定，没有心情上课。"如果赛斯今晚能让我开口说话，就算他厉害"。</td></tr><tr><td>(Just before the session began she did feel nervous.She began dictating in a normal voice however, and maintained it through the session.Her delivery was not characterized by the exaggerated slowness of the last two or three sessions.She paced at her usual moderate rate; her eyes darkened as usual.)</td><td>(就在课开始之前，她确实感到紧张。不过，她还是用正常的声音开始传述，并在整个过程中维持这种状态。她的传讯过程并不像前两三节那样夸张的慢速。她踱步的速度如往常般的适中；眼睛变黑如常。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>A more or less intimate rapport between you helps you both whenever outside difficult situations arise.You are able to draw upon more constructive energy when such rapport exists.This is true in any case, that is, either one involving you Joseph, or involving Ruburt; and the difference between the energies that you tap when you are in rapport with each other and when you are not is immeasurable.</td><td>每当外在困境出现时，你们之间或多或少的亲密关系有助于你们双方。当这种融洽的关系存在时，你们能够汲取更多建设性的能量。在任何情况下都是如此，也就是说，无论是涉及到你，约瑟，还是涉及到鲁伯；当你们彼此的关系融洽时，你们接通的能量与关系不融洽时所接通的能量，其间的差别是不可估量的。</td></tr><tr><td>I can state this in no stronger terms.Communications must always be maintained clearly.I suggest, but merely suggest, that Ruburt hold even; again, patience is not one of his characteristics.I will not dwell upon this matter any longer.Your cocktail party, however, I found immensely amusing, and at a later date I may give you some reasons for its rather explosive nature.</td><td>我无法用更强烈的措辞来说明这一点。沟通必须始终保持清楚。我建议，但只是建议，鲁柏保持平稳；再说一次，耐性不是他的个性之一。我不会对这件事再多说什么。不过，你们的鸡尾酒会，我觉得非常好笑，以后我或许会给你们讲讲它相当具有爆炸性的一些原因。</td></tr><tr><td>("Don’t forget.")</td><td>("不要忘记"。)</td></tr><tr><td>All in all, it is just as well that the relationship between Ruburt and Mrs. Masters be terminated. Ruburt's and your idea of bidding her goodbye is necessarily a good one.</td><td>总而言之，鲁柏和马斯特斯太太的关系结束也是好的，而鲁柏和你向她告别的想法必然是个好主意。</td></tr><tr><td>By this time you should know that our material on material is excellent.I mentioned earlier that very little distortion occurs in such material.There is very much to be covered.It goes without saying then, that there is consciousness of a kind, conscious energy, behind and to some extent within all material.</td><td>到这个时候，你们应该知道我们谈物质的资料有多优秀了。我先前说过，这种资料很少发生扭曲。还有很多的内容要谈。那么不言而喻，在所有物质背后，以及某种程度在所有物质之内，都有一种意识，意识能)量。</td></tr><tr><td>Energy as it comes through your plane is individualized; and indeed, irregardless of any other theories, all energy contains some consciousness, in simple or more complicated gestalt fashion, as I have mentioned that atoms and molecules so possess a limited consciousness, and a generalized sub-consciousness which contains within it a capsule comprehension of the universe as a whole.</td><td>能量在传到你们层面时是个体化的；事实上，不管其他理论如何，所有的能量都包含某种意识，以简单或更复杂的完形方式，就像我提到的，原子和分子拥有一种有限的意识，以及一种广泛性的潜意识，在它之内包含了对宇宙整体的囊括性理解。</td></tr><tr><td>This will help you when we begin to speak of the patterns or shapes into which energy flows, and so maintains its appearance of permanence and relative rigidity.This will be somewhat difficult in the beginning, and yet it is quite understandable.</td><td>当我们开始谈论，能量流入模式或形状，并因此维持了其永久并相对坚固的外观时，这将对你们有所帮助。一开始会有些难以理解，然而这是相当可理解的。</td></tr><tr><td>As energy flows through your field and appears within it, it does so according to its own inherent nature.This nature of energy, believe it or not, includes individualization and consciousness.Therefore, if you will for a moment think of bits of energy, or consciousness, initially without definite form, entering your physical plane, then according to the innate strength and capacity of any given particle it will, on entering your plane, on its own subconscious level already know how small or large a physical pattern it can form.</td><td>当能量流过你们的场域，出现在你们的场域之内时，它这么做，是根据它自己固有的本质。这个能量的本质，不管你信不信，都包括它的个体性和意识。因此，如果你们稍微想一想，最初没有明确形式的点滴能量或意识，进入了你们的物质层面，然后根据任何给定粒子先天的强度和能力，在进入你们的层面时，在它自己的潜意识层次上，已经知道它能形成多小或)多大的物质模式。</td></tr><tr><td>This is at our simplest and most basic level.The forms then build, one within or upon the other, in the manner in which I explained that the gestalt of a human body was maintained.In many ways like does attract like; certain patterns therefore being set up, are used by other energy bits of similar capacity and strength.</td><td>这是在我们最简单也最基本的层次上。然后，这些形式就会建立起来，一个在一个之内或之上，就像我解释过的那种维持人体完形的方式。在许多方面，同类相吸；特定的模式于焉产生，并被其他能力与强度类似的能量位元(energybits)所使用。</td></tr><tr><td>I have explained somewhat earlier how the gestalt ego consciousness was formed, and to some degree explained its psychic composition, but there is much more to be said here.There is a steady and unwavering cooperation that exists, and it is the basis of your physical universe.You do not see this cooperation.Your senses are rather more equipped to notice difference and divergence than sameness; but nevertheless the cooperation of all conscious entities provides physical objects with whatever appearance of permanence they have.</td><td>之前我稍微解释过完形自我意识如何形成的，并在一定程度上解释了它的灵性构成，但这里要说的还有很多。有一种平稳而坚定的合作存在，它是你们物质宇宙的基础。你们看不到这种合作。你们的感官更有能力注意到差异和分歧，而不是同一性；但尽管如此，所有意识存有的合作，为物体提供了它们所具有的任何持久性的外观。</td></tr><tr><td>Your cat and the birds on your rooftop all do their part.With expanded consciousness the responsibility for cooperation becomes more definite.And yet there is really no choice, for upon your physical plane there will be cooperation or annihilation.</td><td>你们的猫和你们屋顶上的鸟全都尽着牠们的本分。随着意识的扩展，合作的责任变得更加明确。但其实没有选择，因为在你们的物质层面上，不是合作，就是毁灭。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26.Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed in the same normal manner at 9:31.)</td><td>(9:26休息。珍像往常一样解离，她在9:31以正常的方式恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>This cooperation is a necessity on a molecular level, and continues through all phases of physical existence.Remember however that it is the conscious cooperation of the individualized energy that makes the molecule itself possible.</td><td>这种合作在分子层次上是必要的，而且贯穿到物质存在的所有阶段。然而要记住，是个体化能量的有意识合作，让分子本身成为可能。</td></tr><tr><td>As you know, so-called inert objects possess consciousness also, though in a more generalized and much less specific manner, in which to a large degree choice is denied to them.It should be apparent that psychic identity is no more dependent upon physical permanence, certainly when you consider that even a chair retains its form as a chair, even though it is actually not one thing or object, and that no atom or molecule remains the same within it.</td><td>如你所知，所谓的惰性物体(inertobjects)也具有意识，不过是以一种更笼统、更不具体的方式，在很大程度上，它们的选择被剥夺了。应该很明显的是，灵性的本体身分并不更依赖物质的永久性，尤其是当你考虑到，即使是一把椅子也会保留它作为椅子的形式，尽管它实际上不是一个东西或物体，而且没有一个原子或分子在它的内部保持不变。</td></tr><tr><td>When you maintain that identity is dependent upon the duration of the physical body, you are taking it for granted that the physical body is one complete thing, more or less rigid in form, and permanent within a certain perspective.You know however that the physical body is not one thing in those terms, and that the stuff of which it is composed is forever coming and going, arriving and departing, and yet identity is maintained.</td><td>当你们坚持认为本体身分(identity)依赖肉体的持续时间，你们就理所当然地认为，肉体是一个完整的东西，形态上多少是硬质的，而且在某种角度上看，也是经久不变的。然而，你们知道，肉体就这些方面来说，并不是一样东西，而且组成它的东西永远是来了又去、到来又离去，然而身份依然维持不变。</td></tr><tr><td>The limits of identity are arbitrary on your part, developed throughout the stages of your evolutionary process, not for any reason inherent in identity itself, but merely for purely practical reasons on your physical field, having to do with the amount of matter that various kinds of identities could effectively manipulate and control.</td><td>身份的限制是你们任意的，在你们演化过程的各个阶段发展出来的，不是本体身份自身所固有的任何原因，而只是基于在你们物质场域上的纯粹实际的理由，这与各种本体身份能够有效操纵及控制的物质数量有关。</td></tr><tr><td>In some ways it may be said truly that the physical universe itself puts a limit on the extension of personal identity, and we will go into this also later.</td><td>在某些方面，也许的确可以说，物质宇宙本身对个人身份的扩展上设下了限制，我们以后也会讨论这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>I have mentioned, for example, what you may think of as infinite building blocks or pyramids of comprehension, and these could not operate within your physical universe, as the basic gestalt freedom is severely limited.This is also one of the reasons why whole entities, as whole entities, do not exist in your field, but only separate, partially disconnected portions.</td><td>我提过，比方说，你们可能认为是无限的建构模块或理解力的金字塔，这些在你们的物质宇宙中无法运行，因为基本的完形自由度受到了严重的限制。这也是整体存有，为什么不能在你们的场域，作为整体存有存在的原因之一，只能是分离地、部分断开地存在于你们的场域。</td></tr><tr><td>Other fields do allow for greater complexity of psychic organization, and let me remind you again that such psychic organizations do not involve a blurring of individuality in some undefinable whole, as for example any drowning of consciousness in some gigantic, benign super consciousness.This is not the point.</td><td>在其他场域确实允许更复杂的灵性组织，这样的灵性组织并不涉及在一些不可界定的整体中之个体性的模糊，例如任何淹没在某种巨大的、良性的超级意识中的意识。这不是问题的关键。</td></tr><tr><td>You may not be aware of the conscious nature of each atom in your body, or of the gestalt consciousness formed by those atoms as they build into cells, but it is not necessary for them, or for their own awareness of themselves, that you give them that recognition.The consciousness in the cells exists whether or not you recognize it.</td><td>你们可能没有认识到，你们身体里每个原子的意识性质，也没有认识到，这些原子在构建成细胞时形成的完形意识，但对它们，或对它们自身对自己的觉知而言，你对它们的认知并不是必要的。无论你们是否认识到，细胞中的意识都存在。</td></tr><tr><td>Another inherent ability of energy is its own innate recognition of potential form.This is seen in the innate comprehension existing in the fetus.No one atom or molecule within the fetus will exist within the adult, and yet the bits of energy that have formed together to form the pattern of the fetus know the capacity and limits of their own nature, and know therefore the potentialities and limits of the pattern which they have made.</td><td>能量的另一个与生具来的能力，就是它本身对潜在形式的天生认知。这一点可以在存在胎儿之中的天生理解力看到。胎儿之内的每个原子或分子都不会存在成人之内，可是聚焦在一起而形成这胎儿模式的能量位元，却都知道它们自身本质的能力和限制，所以也知道它们形成的模式有何潜能和限制。</td></tr><tr><td>They follow the law of value fulfillment, which on your plane is thought of as growth. But the growth, so-called, is not of itself a property of matter, in that the same matter does not grow, but energy completely forms the pattern ever anew, as far as the particular strength of the energy itself can carry it, and knowing the limitations and capacities of the pattern which it has formed.To some extent the image or physical pattern ultimately blurs.</td><td>它们遵循值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的法则，在你们层面上被认为是成长，但是这个所谓的成长，本身并不是物质的属性，因为同样的物质并没有成长，而是能量彻底形成了模式的焕然一新，只要能量本身特有的力道能够承载它，并且知道它所形成的模式具有的局限性和能力。在某种程度上，这形象或物质模式最终)会变得模糊。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:57.Jane was dissociated as usual. She resumed in the same natural manner at 10:05.)</td><td>(9:57休息。珍像往常一样解离，10:05她用同样的方式恢复，)</td></tr><tr><td>It must be apparent however that all energy is not materialized as it passes through your field.There are also psychic gestalts with intelligences that are not materialized on your physical plane, and with these you are not of course familiar.</td><td>然而，很显然，所有的能量在通过你们的场域时，都不是物质化的。也有ㄧ些具有智性的灵性完形，在你们的物质层面上没有物质化，而这些你们当然不熟悉。</td></tr><tr><td>You had better forget the habit of thinking of your physical universe as a place, for it is simply not a place.Locations of this sort mean nothing.Even space, as you think of it, does not exist.Fifth dimensional space is something else again.The appearance of space is a distortion of your own perception, and that is all.</td><td>你们最好忘记把你们的物质宇宙当作一个地方的习惯，因为它根本不是一个地方。这样的地点毫无意义。就连你们认为的空间，也不存在。第五维度空间又是另外一回事。空间的外观是你们自己感知的扭曲，仅此而已。</td></tr><tr><td>What your senses show to be empty, you term space, and you think of matter rather paradoxically as filling up space, and yet as being where space is not, so-called space and so-called material are energy, and the true properties of energy are very difficult to explain to you, because all your concepts are so limited.</td><td>你们的感官所显示为空(empty)的地方，你们称之为空间(space)，颇为矛盾的是，你们认为物质占据空间(space)，而被占据之处却又不是空间(注:不是空的)，所谓的空间和所谓的物质都是能量，而能量的真实属)性，对你们解释起来非常困难，因为你们所有的概念都是如此有限。</td></tr><tr><td>You must think in terms of something being or not being, and this will get you nowhere.Everything that is, is, whether or not you can perceive it.You are equipped however to perceive far more than you do, through use of the inner senses.</td><td>你们非得从某物存在或不存在的角度来思考，这样想是不会有结果的。一切之"所是"，它就"是"(Everythingthatis,is,)，无论你们能否感知到它。然而，透过使用内在感官，你们能感知到的，比你们现在能感知到的要多得多。</td></tr><tr><td>Incidentally, in the same manner that psychological experience exists, and does not take up space, in this same manner do psychic gestalts of intelligence exist, more or less within your plane and yet not visible to your senses.They have some limited effect on your plane however, but this is part of another discussion.</td><td>顺便一提，以同样的方式，心理经验存在，并且不占用空间，以同样的方式，智性的灵性完形也存在，或多或少在你们的层面内，但不为你们的感官所见。不过，它们对你们的层面有一些有限的影响，但这是另一个讨论的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>Also, for reasons that I will for now withhold, the psychic patterns within your physical universe are not maintained, as you know, indefinitely.As far as I know, no gestalt of any kind remains the same.But psychic gestalts develop in terms of value fulfillment, and it is known at the first appearance of a physical pattern how long the particular to-be-built-up gestalt will be maintained.</td><td>还有，基于某些我暂时不说的原因，你们物质宇宙中的灵性模式，就像你们知道的，并不是无限期地维持下去的。据我所知，没有任何种类的完形一直保持不变。但灵性完形是以值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的方式发展起来的，而且在一个物质模式首次出现时，就已经知道这个有待建立的完形将会维持多久。</td></tr><tr><td>Energy itself is continually new—event, and motion, and no particular pattern will suffice it for long.Energy is self-renewing, and indefinite duration of pattern would lead to dead ends.Energy always builds.Identity, again, is not dependent upon matter.Energy propels and carries along with it, its own traces.</td><td>能量本身一直都是新的——事件，与动态(motion)，没有一个特定的模式能足够让它长久。能量是自行更新的，无限期的模式会导致死胡同。能量总是在进行创建。本体身分(identity)，再说一次，不依赖于物质。能)量在推进，并带着它自己的轨迹。</td></tr><tr><td>Identity, being independent of matter, is then not finished when the particular physical pattern is no longer created.Energy while being propulsive, is also retentive.It retains what you may call memory of previous gestalts.Capsule comprehension exists even in the smallest particle of energy, and even within the smallest particle of energy there exists all possibilities of development and creation.</td><td>本体身分是独立于物质的，因此，当特定的物质模式不再被创造时，本体身分并未结束。能量虽然是推动性的，但也是保留性的。它保留着你们可以称之为在此之前的完形们(previousgestalts)之记忆。囊括的理解力甚至存在于最微小的能量粒子内，即使在最微小的能量粒子之内，也存在着发展与创造的所有可能)性。</td></tr><tr><td>A psychic gestalt is dependent upon matter, not for its identity but merely for its survival in the physical plane.Psychic gestalts or identities or individualities are for all practical purposes immortal.They may join other gestalts but they will never be less than they once were.Identity then is never broken down.Any apparent breaking down is never an actual fact, as the personality could be thought of as a breaking down of the entity; but this is not so.The personality did not exist as such before its creation by the entity, and once it becomes an identity, it retains that individuality.</td><td>灵性完形依赖于物质，不是为了它的本体身分，而只是为了它在物质层面的存活。灵性完形或本体身分或个体，在所有实际意义上都是不朽的。它们可以加入其他的完形，但永远不会比它们曾经所是的那个完形少。因此，本体身分(identity)永远不会被打破(brokendown)。任何表面的分解从来不是一个事实，如同人格可能被认为是存有的一个分解；但事实并非如此。人格在被存有创造出来之前并不存在，一旦它成为一种本体身分，便会保留那种个体性。</td></tr><tr><td>Earlier it was merely a possibility, as for example a painting that you may paint next year is now only a possibility.I am endeavoring to end our sessions, for a while at least, at an earlier hour for several reasons, which will not concern you;

You got the ball?"</td><td>(然后我就结束了自己的诱导。似乎过了一会儿，我意识到，我正看着一个身穿白色圆点深色连衣裙的年轻女子，走上后阳台的三或四层台阶，进了屋子，纱门在她身后关上。她可能提着什么东西。台阶脚下站着一个小女孩，仰头望着她消失在门后的母亲。[我不知道自己是怎么感觉到如此肯定那是一对母女。]小女孩有着棕色的长发，穿着样式普通的短洋装，背对着我站着。然后我很清楚地听到她用小女孩的高音说："你拿到球了吗？你拿到球了吗？"</td></tr><tr><td>(These people I saw with adequate distinction, yet not with the needle-sharp, vivid vision I have experienced on some occasions, as for instance the man ’s head of Sunday 6/7.I did not recognize either one of them.</td><td>(这些人我都看得很清楚，但不像我在某些场合经验过的视象那么鲜明生动，例如我在6月7日星期日看到的那个男人头像。他们两人我都不认识。</td></tr><tr><td>(In answer to the little girls question, I said, "Here’s your ball, little girl."

Jane and I have not checked further.I remember that upon obtaining the name while in the trance state, I became very anxious that I remember it to write down later.Ironically, upon awakening I discovered that at least momentarily I had forgotten it; but as soon as I began writing this account the name Bonnie Lou came to mind, and I feel that it is correct.</td><td>(可以再补充的是，第二天珍和我正要出门的时候，遇到了伦纳德姚迪斯，我们隔壁的邻居。伦纳德姚迪斯认识瑞尔森先生，说他有一个女儿，他认为她可能有17岁。至于她的名字，伦纳德姚迪斯不太熟悉瑞尔森先生的情况，他猜可能是朱莉或凯西之类的，珍和我还没有进一步的核对。我记得，当在出神状态获得这个名字时，我就非常着急，怕忘记，所以等一会儿要把它写下来。讽刺的是，醒来时，我发现至少有那么一下子，我已经忘记了它；但当我开始写这篇记述时，脑海中就浮现出邦妮-卢这个名字，我觉得它是正确的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Sunday 6/21, 9:30 PM:Once again while in the desired state I felt my hands and forearms become quite enlarged; and again in this state they felt as though they were far apart—again, 6feet or so.My thrilling sensation was just beginning when the state was interrupted by an opening door.I felt the experience could have been a good one.</td><td>(6月21日，星期日，晚上9:30：我又一次在所需的状态中感觉到我的手和上臂变得很大；而且再次在这种状态中感觉到它们好像分得很开——又是大约6英)呎左右。我的震颤感才刚开始，出神状态就被突如其来的开门声打断。我觉得这原本有可能会是个很棒的经验。</td></tr><tr><td>(Monday, 6/22, Tuesday 6/23: Missed.Jane's father is visiting us for a few days.We also missed Monday night’s session.Jane experienced no discomfort of any kind as session time came and went.At session time Jane, Del, Midge [his companion] and I were visiting our landlord and his wife at their farm in Pine City.</td><td>(6月22日，星期一，6月23日，星期二：缺。珍的父亲这几天来看我们。我们也错过了星期一晚上的课。上课时间来了又过去了，珍没有感到任何不舒服的感觉。在原本的上课时间，珍、德尔、米姬[他的女伴]和我一行人，去松城的农场拜访了我们的房东和他的妻子。</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 64</td><td>第64节个别性的物质建构)1964年6月24日星期三晚上9点按指示</td></tr><tr><td>JUNE 24, 1964 9 PM WEDNESDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>(原定6月22日星期一的课，因珍的父亲从加州来访</td></tr><tr><td>(Mondays session, due 6/22, was not held because Jane’s father was visiting us from California.This is the first session we have deliberately missed since the sessions began last December.Jane's father arrived last Saturday and as early as Sunday morning Jane announced to me that there would be no session Monday night.</td><td>而没有举行。这是我们自去年12月开始上课以来，第一次故意错过的课。珍的父亲于上周六抵达，星期日一早，珍就向我宣告，星期一晚上不上课。</td></tr><tr><td>(At the exact time the session was due Monday Jane, Del, Midge and I were visiting our landlord and his wife on their farm in Pine City.As 9 PM approached I watched Jane to see if she would give any sign that she was aware of Seth, or that he wanted a session.She gave none; later Jane said she hadn’t the slightest inkling of Seth's presence as session time passed.Del and Midge have left, and we anticipate a normal session tonight.</td><td>(就在星期一原定的上课时间，珍、德尔、米姬和我正在我们房东夫妇的松城农场。快到晚上9点的时候，我观察着珍，看她是否觉察到赛斯来到、或赛斯想上课的迹象。她没有给出任何迹象；后来珍说，随着上课时间的过去，她丝毫没有赛斯在场的讯息。德尔和麦基已经离开，我们预料今天晚上会正常上课。</td></tr><tr><td>(It will be remembered that in the last, 63rd, session, pages 158. 159, Seth stated that a narcotics scandal was to break in Elmira within 3 months.This information was given on 6/17/64.Today 6/24, 1964, an article appeared in the Elmira StarGazette detailing a narcotics trial taking place in Ithaca NY, perhaps 35 miles distant.

and these themselves give off vibrations that are received subconsciously, and also serve therefore to give indications of approximate location, bulk, and even particular material and color, to the subconscious mind of any observer, so-called; although he does not see your construction but forms his own, more or less in faithful replica, to what he has subconsciously perceived telepathically from you and any other constructor, from generalized notions of the idea behind the construction, and from vibrations and even impacts received from the atoms and molecules that compose other constructions of the so-called single object.</td><td>这需要简短解释一下。如果你们三个人把注意力转移到电视机，第一个想到它的人，就会形成所谓的初始建构。这样说是为了简单起见。我告诉过你们，所有的生命——我将会用条件(conditions)这个词——共同合作建构你们的物质宇宙。约瑟，你们电视机的建构，将涉及到能量的使用，形成原子和分子的各种组合；而这些组合本身也会发出振动，被潜意识地接收，因此也具有给任何观察者的潜意识心智提供大概的位置、体积，甚至是特定材质和颜色的作用。虽然他没有看到你们的建构，但他形成了他自己的，或多或少的忠实复制品，以他潜意识中的心灵感应，从你和任何其他建构者那里感知到的东西，从建构背后的理念的一般见解，以及从组成其他建构的所谓的单一物体之原子和分子中接收到的振动，甚至冲击。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, due to variations existing in the capacity of various individuals to receive, perceive, and act upon such information, no constructions are exactly the same, though generally they appear the same; and for utility’s sake they are effective enough.</td><td>现在，由于不同的个体在接收、感知和对这些讯息采取行动的能力上存在着差异，没有任何结构是完全相同的，尽管一般来说它们看起来是一样的；为了实用的缘故，它们是足够有效的。</td></tr><tr><td>Slip ups can occur along any of the above mentioned lines.A thick black rubber hose in a backyard after dark for a moment actually becomes, or could become, to a timid soul a particularly vicious, ridiculously long and fat black snake.</td><td>上述任何一方面都有可能发生差错。天黑之后，后院的一条又粗又黑的橡胶水管，对一个胆小的人来说，一瞬间居然变成了，或者说可能变成了一条特别凶恶的、长得离谱的大黑蛇。</td></tr><tr><td>This is not a case of a hose looking like a snake.This is a failure of a different sort, according to whether or not the constructor of the hose is present or still constructing his object.There is something here that I will explain.I have briefly mentioned before, I believe, what I will term an afterimage.When you cease active construction of an object, the pattern begins to fade but remains inactive.</td><td>这不是一条水管看起来像蛇的情况。这是一种不同类型的失败，依据水管的建构者是否在场，或仍在建构他的物体而定。这里有件事我要解释一下。我相信，我以前曾简单地提到过我将称之为后像(afterimage.)的东西。当你停止主动建构一个物体时，这个模式就开始消褪，但维持着不活动。</td></tr><tr><td>Weak vibrations are present and can be perceived.Here we will imagine the weak pattern—form of the hose, and an individual perceiving the generalized pattern.There is a lack of further data, no telepathic message being perceived perhaps.</td><td>仍有微弱的振动存在，可以被感知。在这里，我们将想像这微弱模式——水管的形态，和个人感知到的一般性的模式。缺乏更进一步的资料，或许也没有心灵感应的信息可被感知。</td></tr><tr><td>Going upon the little information at hand, given the darkness, fears come to the foreground.The individual actually constructs a snake, but a faulty impossible one, from the weak hose pattern.The snake, for reasons that we will discuss later, under these conditions could not exist in your universe.</td><td>根据手头的一点信息，考虑到黑暗，恐惧就会浮现在眼前。这个人确实从微弱的水管模式建构出一条蛇，但却是一条有缺陷不真实的蛇。基于我们以后会讨论)的理由，在这些条件下，那条蛇无法存在你们的宇宙中。</td></tr><tr><td>If our individual calls for help, and if per chance the constructor of the hose answers the appeal, his hose construction would take precedence, filling its old pattern.</td><td>如果这个人大声呼救，如果碰巧水管的建构者回应了这个诉求，那么他的水管建构就会优先考虑，填补其旧的模式。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:46.Jane was dissociated as usual.Once again she said her back felt fine during delivery of the material.She felt while delivering that Seth thought he had gone too far in giving us the hose-snake material at this point, since it raised too many questions he didn’t want to go into yet.</td><td>(10:46休息。珍解离如常。再一次，她说她的后背在传讯资料的过程中感觉很好。她觉得在传述的时候，赛斯认为，在这个时候为我们提供这份水管-蛇的资料，太过头了，因为它会引出很多问题，而他还不打算去谈。</td></tr><tr><td>(While receiving this material I seemed to be in a light trance state myself, feeling quite lethargic at times.My writing hand displayed no weariness.Jane resumed her rather deep voice at 10:55.)</td><td>(在接收这份资料的同时，我自己也似乎进入了一种轻微的出神状态，有时觉得昏昏欲睡。我写字的手一点都不觉得累。10:55珍用非常低沉的声音恢复传)述。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am keeping within my intention of holding rather briefer sessions for a while.Nevertheless there are a few points that I would like to make.</td><td>我会保持我的决定，亦即在一段时间内，上比较短的课。不过，有几点我想说。</td></tr><tr><td>The individual's ability to receive these impressions of which we have been speaking, and his ability to translate them and to construct them, is all determined by his own personal psychic background in past existences and in the present one, and by his own inner conception of himself, the physical universe, his place in it, and by his inner reactions to ideas.</td><td>个人接收我们所说的这些印象的能力，以及他转译与建构这些印象的能力，都是由他自己在过去的存在和)在这一世的个人灵性背景决定的，也是由他对自己、对物质宇宙、对自己在其中的位置的内在概念，以及他对理念的内在反应决定的。</td></tr><tr><td>He actually creates his own environment, but this environment is created by him according to conceptions received telepathically now, in childhood, in infancy, and even before birth.</td><td>他确实创造他自己的环境，但这个环境是他根据现在、童年、婴儿期、甚至出生前，透过心灵感应接收的概念创造出来的。</td></tr><tr><td>This in itself is extremely important, and we will deal with it rather extensively in terms of early limitations set by parental attitudes personally and collectively, in terms of individual self-realizations, and in terms of even national accomplishments and racial expectations.</td><td>这本身就极为重要，我们将从父母各自的，和共同的态度所设定的早期限制，从个体的自我领悟，甚至从公民的成就和种族期望这些方面，大范围地讨论它。</td></tr><tr><td>Limitations set upon the self are damaging to the race as a whole, and impede value fulfillment.Psychic gates are closed by parents and fences set up around the self, closing out many important possibilities of growth and fulfillment; these barriers must be broken; as mans conception of himself enlarges so will his actual capabilities and possibilities be extended.His psychic limitations are largely self-adopted.</td><td>对自己设定限制，对整个种族是有害的，而且妨碍值的充盈(valuefulfillment)。灵性之门被父母关上，围栏也在自己的周围竖起，关闭了许多重要的成长和实现的可能性；这些障碍必须被打破；当人对自己的概念扩大了，他的实际能力和可能性也会扩展。他的灵性限制，在很大程度上是自己养成的。</td></tr><tr><td>I will here close the session.We have covered much this evening, and there is much I would still like to cover.However, eleven o’clock time for now is a reasonable and overall effective closing time.</td><td>我将在此结束本节课。今晚我们谈了不少，我还有许多要说。但现在11点，是一个合理和整体有效的结束)时间。</td></tr><tr><td>Do not grow impatient.You will become, or you will have, plenty of time to become tired of me yet.Ruburt, my bonus for an excellent session will be a more comfortable back.He is handling himself in a much more efficient manner lately however, and all is well.</td><td>不要变得没有耐性。你们会变得，或者说你们会有足够的时间，变得厌倦我。鲁柏，对一节出色的课程，我给的奖励，将是一个感觉更舒服的背。不过他最近照料自己的方式，比以前更有效率，一切都很好。</td></tr><tr><td>I enjoy the children’s sculpture, and suggest you consider them, particularly the two large ones, as part of your more or less permanent household collection.And now, my old pie eyes, I bid you a fond good evening.</td><td>我很喜欢这些孩子的雕塑，建议你们考虑把它们，特别是那两件大的，作为你们多多少少是永久家庭收藏的一部分。现在，我的两位睁着大眼睛的老朋友，祝你们有个美好的夜晚。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth.

landowner in Denmark, in Triev, in the 1600's.</td><td>(记得赛斯曾多次提到，在16世纪丹麦的特里夫，我是一个地主。</td></tr><tr><td>(Our cat Willy had been somewhat active ever since the session began.Now once again he began to run after Jane.This time, instead of diving at her ankles, he jumped up on my table; then as Jane walked by he reached out at her; his claws caught in her slacks.Without breaking her delivery Jane picked him up and then dumped him into another room; she closed the door.)</td><td>(我们家的猫咪威利，自从课程开始后，就一直有些活跃，现在，牠又开始追着珍。这一次，牠没有扑向她的脚踝，反而是跳上我的桌子；然后当珍走过时，就伸出爪子抓她，勾住她的长裤。没有中断传讯，珍把牠拎起来，扔进另一个房间，然后关上门。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am now used to being so greeted by your pussycat, and while it bothers me not one whit, Ruburt does not take kindly to being so treated.</td><td>我现在已经习惯你们家猫咪的这种问候了，虽然我一点都不觉得牠烦，但鲁柏就不喜欢这种对待了。</td></tr><tr><td>You need privacy, and I am concerned.Privacy will actually help you deal with the outside world in a more efficient manner, that will enable you to receive benefits from the outside world because of a more relaxed attitude toward it.</td><td>你们需要隐私，我也很关心。隐私其实会帮助你们更有效地与外界打交道，这将使你们能够从外界获得益处，因为你们对外界的态度更加放松了。</td></tr><tr><td>You should not go into debt.That is, though I am no banker, you should not at this time pay more than six thousand, even though a higher figure might make more land possible.The financial worry would, in the end, even cause you, and not Ruburt, to feel bitter at the land itself.You were used to getting a livelihood, and a good one, from the land.</td><td>你们不应该举债。也就是说，虽然我不是银行家，但你们现在支付的钱不应该超过六千，就算更高的数目可能买到更多土地。财务上的担忧，到头来，甚至会使你，而不是鲁柏，对土地本身感到苦恼。你已经习惯了从土地上获得生计，而且是不错的生计。</td></tr><tr><td>The idea of purchasing it now causes subconscious anger, though you love land.Ruburt will prove to expand as you will.He will be very good with anything having to do with planting, and the intimacy with the seasons will bring you both to a greater psychic fruition.This intimacy with the seasons is important to you both.</td><td>虽然你喜欢土地，但买地的念头现在却引发了潜意识的怒气。事实将证明鲁柏会扩展，你也一样。他将非常擅长任何与种植有关的事，与季节的亲密，将带给你们两个更大的灵性成果。与季节的这份亲密对你们两个都很重要。</td></tr><tr><td>I am certainly not going to make any decisions for you.The house at which you looked today should prove an excellent buy, though I am not necessarily speaking in financial terms.The intimacy with nature that you would enjoy there would pay off in ways that you do not know.</td><td>我当然不会为你们做任何决定。你们今天看的那栋房子，应该会证明是个很好的买点，但我说的不一定是财务方面。你们在那里将享受到的与自然的亲密，会以你们不知道的方式带来回报。</td></tr><tr><td>(As Jane delivered the following paragraph, I felt my familiar thrilling sensation sweep over me from head to toe, quite strongly.Remnants of it lasted for a while as the session proceeded.)</td><td>(当珍讲到下面这段话的时候，我感觉到我熟悉的震颤感从头到脚席卷而来，相当强烈。随着课程的进行，这余波仍持续了一段时间。)</td></tr><tr><td>If you purchase the house, you will paint two pictures in particular, landscapes in tempera, that will help set your name.The house itself is good, for it is high and near water.You should be near water.You should not, however, be on low ground.You should not buy a house, even with much land, that is not near water, for it will not content you and you will give it up.Water, that is a body of water, has value for the development of inner abilities.</td><td>如果你们买了这栋房子，你要特别画两幅画，蛋彩风景画，会助你建立名声。房子本身很好，因为它位置高又靠近水。你们应该靠近水。但是，你们不应该住在地势低的地方。你们不应该买一间不靠近水的房子，就算它有大片土地，因为它不会让你们满意，你们会放弃它。水，也就是一片水域，有开发内在能力的价值。</td></tr><tr><td>I have not discussed this yet, and this is not the time for such discussion.</td><td>我还没有讨论过这个，现在也不是讨论的时候。</td></tr><tr><td>In your time to come, if possible you would do well to live by an ocean or even a large lake.A river is the next best thing, as long as the land is not low.The house at which you looked is good, again, because it is on high ground, and because it is above and near water, and is without seepage.There is rock beneath.The foundations are good, and the currents far down beneath the foundations are good ones.I am speaking here of something else which we have not yet discussed.</td><td>在你们未来的时间里，如果可能的话，你们最好住在海边甚至大湖边。河流是次佳的选择，只要地势不低。你们看的那栋房子不错，再说一次，因为它地势高，在水面之上，又靠近水，而且没有渗水。底下有岩石。地基很好，远在地基之下的水流是好的。我这里讲的是我们还没有讨论过的事。</td></tr><tr><td>The hill is a friendly and not threatening one, and in other seasons the setting is more open than it is now.The psychic attributes of the house are good ones.It is one of many locations which you would find very suitable, and which if I may say so, would seem almost to be made to order.</td><td>这座山丘是一个友好的，没有威胁的山丘，在其他季节，环境比现在更开放。那栋房子的灵性属性是很好的。你们会找到很多非常合适的地点，这是其中之一，如果我可以这样说，这几乎是为你们定制的。</td></tr><tr><td>The child who lived in the house until recently was somewhat disturbed, and had he lived there longer the house would not have remained psychically beneficial, but it is psychically beneficial now.High land such as this is good from a health and psychic viewpoint.I do not know of any impending danger with the neighbors, who stick alone.</td><td>直到最近还住在这栋房子的那个小孩，有点不安宁，如果他住的时间长了，房子就不会保持有益灵性的状态，但现在房子是有益灵性的。像这样的高地，从健康和灵性的观点来看，是很好的。我不知道与独居的邻居有什么即将发生的危险)</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a short break and I will continue, though very briefly.</td><td>我建议稍作休息，然后我会继续，但会很短。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 7:40.Jane was dissociated as usual.The time had passed rapidly, it seemed.The house had, we had been told, about an acre of land, although it was all on the steep side of a hill.We had found it unlocked and had gone inside, but had not thought to examine specifically the foundations.On one side the hill dropped down to the highway; on the other side it rose at a steep slant.Jane and I had wondered about landslides.</td><td>(7:40休息。珍解离如常。似乎，时间过得很快。我们得知，这栋房子大约有一英亩的土地，但都在山坡的陡峭处。我们发现房子没上锁，就进去了，但没有想到专门检查地基。山坡的一边直下公路；另一边则是上升的陡坡，珍和我怀疑会不会发生山体滑坡的问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same manner at 7:45.)</td><td>(7:45珍以同样的方式恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>The psychic freedom and burst of energy that you will experience as a direct result of intimacy with land will be released regardless of the amount of land.Some feeling of ownership is necessary.However, though you may not want to accept this, old landowner Joseph, an acre will release this energy as well as ten acres.You have little conception of the energy that would be beneficially yours, even in the development of one acre that was yours.</td><td>你们将体验到的灵性自由与能量的爆发，是你们与土地亲密接触的直接结果，无论土地数量多少，都会得到释放。ㄧ些所有权的感觉是必要的。但老地主约瑟，尽管你可能不想接受这一点，但一亩地和十亩地一样会释放这股能量。你对这将有利于你的能量没有什么概念，即使是在开发属于你的一亩地时。</td></tr><tr><td>I picked the sixthousand figure for good reason.You may feel secure at this figure.A fifteen-or-twenty-year mortgage need not upset you, as a six thousand-dollar home purchase will be paid off by you without fret in a period of five to eight years.</td><td>我选6000这个数目是有原因的。这个数目可能让你有)安全感。不需要15到20年的房贷让你心烦，因为)6000元的房款，你在5到8年内就能轻松还清。</td></tr><tr><td>For reasons too complicated to go into, a larger amount would not be paid off until much later, because the fears that you would have would prevent full utilization of your energies.The energies released in the purchase of the house at which you looked will, themselves, indirectly allow you to pay off the amount within the five-to-eight year period.</td><td>由于原因太复杂，较大的金额要到很久以后才能还清，因为你将会有的担心，会阻碍你充分利用你的能量。在购买你们看中的房子时释放的能量，本身就会间接让你们在五到八年的时间内还清这笔款项。</td></tr><tr><td>You have no worries at this amount.This is not a general statement, but applies to the specific house of which we speak.All the conditions change when the object or the land is different.A house psychically unsound would greatly cut down your ability to pay for it.</td><td>这个数目你们不会担心。这不是一般的说法，但适用于我们谈的这间房子。物件或土地不同，所有的条件都会跟着改变。一栋灵性不健全的房子，会大大削减)你们的支付能力。</td></tr><tr><td>I anticipate no road difficulties.Your idea of trading your car for an old jeep would work out very well, and would not be costly.All windows in the house should be, as Ruburt suggested, opened; let the hilltop air blow through.The bottom of the house has been closed for too long, but there is no great difficulty here.Opening the windows in the lower portion will abet a slight musty dampness.</td><td>我预计道路不会有问题。你想把你们的小客车换成旧吉普车，这个主意行得通，而且花费不会太高。房子里所有的窗户，都应该像鲁柏建议的那样，敞开；让山顶的空气吹进来。房子的底部已经封闭太久，但不会有什么大问题。打开窗户的下半部，将会搅动轻微的潮湿霉味。</td></tr><tr><td>("Are there any children in the neighborhood?"</td><td>("附近的住家有孩子吗？"</td></tr><tr><td>(There are two other houses on the hill, both quite far from ours; one is above it a good distance, the other beyond it.)</td><td>(山上还有两栋房子，都离我们很远；一栋在上方很远的距离，另一栋在它后面。)</td></tr><tr><td>There are no children.I do not see any in a reasonable future.The location is advantageous from many viewpoints.I am very concerned with the psychic elements of any home you are considering.The psychic influence there is safe.Again, high ground is beneficial, and a hilltop arrangement such as this, with its proximity to water, is quite unusual.</td><td>没有孩子。在合理的未来里，我没有看到任何小孩。从很多角度看，这个地点都是有利的。我非常关注你们考虑的任何房屋的灵性元素。那里的灵性影响是安全的。再次地，地势高的地方是有利的，而像这样靠近水域的山顶位置，是很不寻常的。</td></tr><tr><td>(It might be added that the house sits on the hillside on one side of the main highway leading west out of Elmira.On the other side of the highway runs the Chemung River.Jane and I could see the river from the long front porch of the house, looking down through the trees.The view would obviously be even better in the winter.)</td><td>(应该补充的是，这栋房子坐落在埃尔米拉西边主要公路的一侧山坡上。公路的另一侧是希芒河。珍和我)可以从房子长长的前廊，透过树林往下看到那条河。冬天的景色显然会更好。)</td></tr><tr><td>I would strongly suggest a garden, in which both of you work.You will find a strong attachment to it, Joseph, as will Ruburt, and there is room.With the surrounding woodland, I see that a garden and a quiet lawn place to the side of the house is very good.You will find that a very small pond arrangement, of the artificial purchased sort, a basin arrangement where water drips through rocks, behind the glass windows in the rear, here with a very simple grouping of rocks and flowers, would serve you to great benefit: as a place of inner Contemplation, in which the inner senses would greatly expand their reach.</td><td>我强烈建议有一个花园，让你们两都在里面工作。你会发现对它有强烈的依恋，约瑟，鲁柏也会，而且那里有空地。在林地环绕中，我看见一座花园和屋旁一片静谧的草坪，非常的好。你还会发现一个非常小的池塘，人造池塘的那种，有一个水槽，水流过岩石滴下，就在屋后的玻璃窗外，这里有非常简单的岩石和花的组合，对你们大有裨益：作为一个冥想的地方，内在感官将大大地扩展其范围。</td></tr><tr><td>Later, and Ruburt sensed part of this, a simple and inexpensive enclosure here would provide the utmost in privacy.Not for a sacred grove, and yet for a simple setting within the outdoor nature that would serve you very well for a different sort of inner sense development than you usually achieve indoors.</td><td>后来，鲁伯也感觉到了其中的一部分，这里一道简单而不贵的围墙，就能提供极大的隐密性。不是为了一个神圣的园林，但是在户外自然界中的一个简单设置，可为你们带来非常好的，不同于你们通常在室内达成的内在感官的发展。</td></tr><tr><td>The large room is healthy, the white color good.The cellar way must be aired very thoroughly.If you purchase the house I will go through it again to insure that you have the most beneficial psychic atmosphere.</td><td>大房间是有益健康的，白的颜色好。地下室的通道必须通风良好。如果你们买了这栋房子，我会再去察看)一遍，以保证你们拥有最有利的灵性氛围。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, let me set your fears at rest.Financially I see no difficulty with the given figure.The water is pure.The hilltop air will add three years to your life.You will have to make your own decisions.I foresee no trouble myself.You should not keep any of the children’s belongings.</td><td>再一次，让我平伏你们的恐惧。在财务上，我认为所给出的数额没有问题。水是纯净的。山顶的空气会为你们增寿3年。你们必须自己做决定。我自己没有预见任何麻烦。你们不要保留任何小孩的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>("Was there more than one child?")</td><td>("是不是不止一个孩子？")</td></tr><tr><td>There was one child.However, the child had playthings that belonged to another child, and any toys should be discarded.Any children’s balls should be discarded and not given to the cat to play with.</td><td>只有一个小孩。不过，那孩子有原本属于另一个孩子的玩具，所有的玩具都要丢掉。任何小孩玩的球都要丢掉，不要给猫玩。</td></tr><tr><td>("Will we be able to find all the toys scattered about?"</td><td>("我们能找到所有散落的玩具吗？"</td></tr><tr><td>(The house was very dirty and unkempt, and I wondered whether such a small thing as a toy ball could remain undiscovered by Jane and me for some time, with Willy perhaps playing with it in the meantime.)</td><td>(那房子很脏很乱，我在想，像玩具球这类的小东西，会不会在一段时间内，没被我和珍发现，而威利就在这段时间内玩着它。)</td></tr><tr><td>You will be able to find them all without difficulty.I mention this only because otherwise you and Ruburt might think it nice to save a few toys for the cat.There is no great danger here by any means, but these simple precautions will forestall any difficulties.</td><td>你们很容易就能把它们全部找出来。我之所以提到这一点，只是因为你和鲁伯可能会觉得给猫留点玩具也不错。这里并没有什么大的危险，但这些简单的预防)措施，可以防患于未然。</td></tr><tr><td>You mentioned painting the walls, and this is excellent.They should be covered in this manner, and this precaution should be taken generally whenever you change residence.You will find that many times people, not realizing these precautions, come up against unnecessary difficulties that could be avoided.</td><td>你提到粉刷墙壁，这很棒。它们就应该以这种方式覆盖，一般来说，每当你们更换住所，都应该采取这种预防措施。你们会发现，很多时候，人们没有意识到这些预防措施，而惹上本来可以避免的不必要的麻烦。</td></tr><tr><td>I would suggest, if you purchase the house, that you often take your meals in a dining room.The act of eating is psychically significant, and when possible should be treated as such.It is indeed a communion of sorts.</td><td>如果你们买了房子，我会建议你们经常在餐厅用餐。进食这个行为，在灵性上意义重大，在可能的情况下应该这样行事。它的确是一种交流。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a short break.</td><td>我建议休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 8:15. Jane was dissociated as usual.Just before break, she held her hands out to me while dictating to indicate they were "fat, " or felt enlarged.They looked to be so, especially the thumbs and index fingers. I attempted no measurements, since this procedure had indicated before that there would indeed be a definite physical difference in finger circumferences.</td><td>(8:15休息，珍和往常一样解离。就在休息之前，还在传述时，她向我伸出双手，表示自己的手很"胖"，或感觉变大了。它们看上去的确如此，尤其是拇指和食指，我没打算测量，因为之前做的测量已经明确指出，手指的周长的确存在实际的差异。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane said the sensations began to abate soon after break.And then she began dictating again almost immediately in the same manner.)</td><td>(珍说这种感觉在休息后没多久就开始减弱。然后她几乎立即又以同样的方式开始传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>If you prefer, I will deduct this from tomorrow’s session.</td><td>如果你们需要，我可以在明天的课中扣掉今天上课的时间。</td></tr><tr><td>("No.")</td><td>("不用"。)</td></tr><tr><td>The man who lived in the house did have a destructive and sometimes cruel tendency.Nevertheless he was basically creative, and despite uncontrolled and undisciplined energies, his basic creative inner sense added to the psychic atmosphere, but would have turned against him had he remained.</td><td>原先住在这所房子里的人确实有破坏性，有时甚至有残忍的倾向。然而，他基本上是有创造力的，尽管他的能量不受控制也不受约束，但他基本的创造性内在感官，增加了灵性的氛围，但如果他继续留在那里，这反而会对他不利。</td></tr><tr><td>You are both handling your inner and outer lives to much greater advantage than you have been, and I foresee in general no difficulties as long as you adhere to your present course.</td><td>你们两个都把内在与外在生活处理得比以往有利得多，只要你们照着现在的方向走，我预见你们大致上没有任何困难。</td></tr><tr><td>I take it for granted that you will have a telephone if you purchase the house in question.</td><td>如果你们买下这栋房子，我想当然地认为，你们会安装一支电话。</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes.")</td><td>("对。")</td></tr><tr><td>If you did not, this would lead to great bitterness on the part of your family, Joseph, beside this, you can now afford the idea behind a telephone, particularly in the country.There is no need now to fear contact with the outside world.</td><td>如果你们没有电话，你们的家人那边会抱怨，约瑟，再说，你现在担负得起电话背后的想法，特别是在乡)下。现在不需要害怕与外界的接触了。</td></tr><tr><td>I know you realize that the whole place must be cleaned thoroughly, the basement in particular to be aired.All rooms will be beneficial for sleeping, working; the large room, naturally, to be used for our sessions.</td><td>我知道你们明白，整个地方都得彻底清理，尤其地下室更要通风。所有房间都有利于睡眠和工作；大房间自然是我们用来上课的地方。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane gave a broad smile.</td><td>(在这里珍咧出大大的笑容。)</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes.")</td><td>("是啊。")</td></tr><tr><td>Air on all sides is much more beneficial in general than the arrangement you have; even though little acreage indeed is involved, the location and situation is more advantageous than many others with more land, and intimacy with nature will be vivid and good.</td><td>四面流通的空气，总的来说比你们现在的布置有利得多；即便土地面积不大，但是地点和状况，比其他许多有更多土地的房子更具优势，与自然的亲近感也会生动而美好。</td></tr><tr><td>I could go on, again, for quite a while, but I will leave you, hoping that I have helped.There are of course other locations that would be suitable.At this particular time this is the only one available, and it is, after all, no coincidence that you sought it out.Otherwise you would not have bothered.</td><td>我还可以继续说下去，但我要离开了，希望我已经帮到了你们。当然还有其他合适的地点。在这个时间点上，就只有这一间，毕竟，你们找上它并非偶然。否则，你们就不会费心了。</td></tr><tr><td>(The last two sentences immediately answered the thought I had in mind.)</td><td>(最后两句即刻回答了我心中的想法。)</td></tr><tr><td>A period of perhaps two years could elapse before another suitable spot is available.Whether or not you want to wait that long is up to you.Moving such as this should take place either in early spring or this time of year, for many reasons not obviously practical to you.</td><td>也许需要两年时间才能找到另一个合适的地点。是否要等那么久，由你们自己决定。像这样的搬家，应该在早春或者这个时候进行，基于很多对你们显然不实际的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>The river about that location is beneficial.At some other points it is not, and there is malevolent seepage; but not there.</td><td>关于那个位置的河流是有利的。在其他一些位置则不然，有不良的渗漏；但那里没有。</td></tr><tr><td>I bid you my usual fond good evening, with a small note to Ruburt, though I am sure that his housekeeping abilities need no reminder: that the cupboards must be cleaned thoroughly, and the bathroom, since the rooms are fairly close.</td><td>我像往常一样向你们道声晚安，同时给鲁伯留个小提示，虽然我相信他的家务能力不需要提醒：橱柜一定要彻底打扫，还有卫生间，因为房间相当近。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth.

not.</td><td>我知道差不多是你休息的时间了。但是，你要是觉得还可以再帮我涂鸦个几分钟，我很想趁鲁柏还让我过来的时候，多说几句话，因为我不确定休息过后，他会不会阻拦我。</td></tr><tr><td>("Okay."</td><td>("好的"。</td></tr><tr><td>(My hand felt a little fatigue, but only a little.)</td><td>(我的手感觉有些累，但只有一点点。)</td></tr><tr><td>In the past he stayed at the gallery despite some natural disadvantages, because of the independence which he enjoyed there, because of the commitment mentioned earlier, and because of innate interest in paintings which surrounded him.But the fair amount of independence allowed was the main point.</td><td>过去，尽管有一些自然的不利条件，他还是留在了画廊，因为他在那里享受到了独立，因为前面提到的承诺，也因为他对围绕着他的绘画有着天生的兴趣。但是允许有相当的独立自主是主要的一点。</td></tr><tr><td>As a secretary, our dear Ruburt will simply not succeed.At least not as the sort of secretary now required.Taking down someone else’s words, verbatim, is to Ruburt, because of his own creative ability an inferior position.</td><td>当个秘书，我们亲爱的鲁伯根本不会成功。至少不是现在要求的那种秘书。由于鲁柏自己的创造能力，要把别人的话一字不漏地记下来，这对他来说是一个低等的职位。</td></tr><tr><td>The one exception here would be taking down verbatim the words of someone who Ruburt was convinced had superior creative ability or knowledge.</td><td>这里有一个例外，要是鲁柏确信某人具有卓越的创造能力或知识，他就会逐字逐句的记录下来。</td></tr><tr><td>I am doing my best to help clear the basic situation so that at least you will know the reasons behind it, and perhaps you can help Ruburt make a decision accordingly.It is true also, as he knows, that the Florida incident frightened him enough so that he will not leave a job unless he is almost forced into it.</td><td>我在尽力帮忙理清基本情况，至少让你知道背后的原因，或许你可以帮助鲁伯做出相应的决定。佛罗里达州的事件吓坏了他，事实也确实如此，他也知道，所以，除非迫不得已，否则他不会离职。</td></tr><tr><td>Here is a small note that Ruburt blocked earlier concerning you, Joseph.This fear also struck you, and had much to do with your outward acceptance of your job as it stood before you made a change, and a beneficial one, involving it.</td><td>这是稍早时被鲁伯挡下的，是与你有关的一个小注，约瑟。这个恐惧也击中了你，这与你在做出改变之前，对你的工作现状的表面接受很有关系，这涉及的是一个有利的改变。</td></tr><tr><td>You had better take your break before your fingers break.</td><td>你最好在你的手指断掉之前休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:05.Jane was dissociated as usual.She said that Seth had fooled her, that after drinking the wine and relaxing because of it during last break, she realized Seth wanted her to.</td><td>(10:05休息。珍解离如常。她说，赛斯耍了她，在上次休息时喝了酒，并因此而放松，她发觉是赛斯想让她这样的。</td></tr><tr><td>(My hand was somewhat tired.Jane resumed in the same manner at 10:10.)</td><td>(我的手有点累了。珍以同样的方式在10:10分恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>With your permission I am hurrying on while Ruburt still goes along with me, and will suspend our discussion of matter for a while longer.</td><td>你同意的话，我要趁鲁柏还肯配合我时，赶紧多说点，我们对物质的讨论，就再延后一会儿。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt was not projecting other difficulties to the gallery situation, as both of you thought probable, but was reacting to the limits set upon independence.</td><td>鲁柏不是像你们俩想的那样，把其他的难题投射到画廊的情况中，他只是对独立自主受到限制作出反应。</td></tr><tr><td>He would, perhaps, stick to a respect for small details if they were part of a creative concept, even perhaps the creative concept of another, as details are extremely respected by him in his poetry, where he transforms them into creative concept.</td><td>如果小细节是创作概念的一部分，他或许就会看重它们，即使是别人的创意概念，因为在他的诗作中，他就极度看重细节，他把细节转化为有创意的概念。</td></tr><tr><td>The new director does indeed have a fussy, almost womanish love of detail for detail’s sake, and this sort of mind is one with which Ruburt finds it difficult to attune when closely involved.And here is a pretty point: Ruburts insistence upon the term gallery secretary left room for a certain independence and impersonality and leeway, that the term Mr. Soandso’s secretary does not leave room for.</td><td>新主管确实有一种挑剔的、近乎女人似的、为细节而细节的热爱，在近距离相处的时候，鲁柏觉得和这样的一种心智难以调和。还有一点很糟糕：鲁柏坚持的条件是，为画廊秘书保留某种独立自主、非个人性和留有余地的空间，但某某先生的秘书这个词，却没有为这条件留下余地。</td></tr><tr><td>The form without the spirit will always leave Ruburt cold.I myself am a stickler for both.</td><td>缺乏灵(spirit)的形式，向来被鲁柏冷落。我自己倒是两者兼备。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane pounded upon the table for Seth.)</td><td>(珍为赛斯敲了一下桌子。)</td></tr><tr><td>This is then the reason for our fuss, and since Ruburt did enjoy a certain independence in which he functioned well, he now feels deprived and angry.It will be difficult for me to say more, though this much should be a great help.Also, close or even fairly close supervision bothers Ruburt because of the constant closeness of his mother in space, during youth.</td><td>因为鲁伯确实享有一定的独立自主，在这种独立自主中，他的功能发挥得很好，现在他感到被剥夺了，而且很生气。我很难再多说了，但所说的这些，应该会有很大的帮助。另外，由于在年幼的时候，和他母亲在空间上一直很紧密，所以近距离，甚至相当近的监督，让鲁伯感到烦扰。</td></tr><tr><td>A panic reaction could be set off without the reasons for it known.This leads to ego confusion since the personality, trying hard to act in what it thinks is a reasonable manner, cannot understand the vehemence of its rebellion.</td><td>恐慌的反应会在不知道原因的情况下被引发。这导致了自我的困惑，因为人格努力地以它认为合理的方式行事，不能理解其反抗的激愤。</td></tr><tr><td>The money actually has little to do with it here, as far as the basic problem is concerned.Ruburt subconsciously wanted more money to make up for the lack of independence, or rather the taking away of independence.More pay will of course help generally but will not begin to make up for the basic situation, if it is not changed.</td><td>就基本的问题而言，这和金钱其实没什么关系。鲁柏的潜意识里想要更多的钱来补偿他独立自主的缺失，或者说独立自主的被剥夺。更多的收入，一般而言当然会有帮助，但如果基本情况没有改变，并不会开始弥补基本情况的不足。</td></tr><tr><td>As far as blocking is concerned, understand that this is a nearly automatic reaction, built up through the years.And if your positions were reversed, Joseph, you would be blocking me more.I suggest your break.</td><td>就阻挡资料来说，要明白这几乎是一种自动的反应，是经过多年积累的。如果换作是你，约瑟，你会把我挡掉更多。我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:26.Jane was dissociated as usual.She finished this delivery with a good deal of spirit and humor, particularly the final paragraphs.My writing hand felt little fatigue.</td><td>(10:26休息。珍解离如常。她精神高昂、幽默地完成了这次传述，尤其是在最后几段。我写字的手感觉不到累。</td></tr><tr><td>(Because she had been upset by the gallery situation, Jane at this point wished aloud that Seth could help her out as to what the future held; this is something we have scrupulously refrained from doing in any serious way, yet this time we sincerely felt we could use all the help we could get.Even so, we made no formal requests of Seth during break.Jane resumed as before at 10:31.)</td><td>(因为画廊的情况让她很沮丧，珍这时大声说出，希望赛斯能帮助她了解未来的情况会如何；我们一直小心避免认真要求这种事，但这次我们真心觉得，我们能用上所有能得到的帮助。即便如此，我们在休息期间也没有向赛斯提出正式的要求。在10:31前，珍恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>I do not see any serious difficulty ahead for you.Regardless of knowledge, no life is without problems, but if these problems are considered as challenges the way will be much easier.</td><td>我看不出在你们前面有什么严重的难题。无论知识如何，人生没有不存在问题的，但如果把这些问题当作挑战，路就会容易一些。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, Joseph, the fact that your intimate life is on an even keel has helped both of you lately, and your understanding has been most rewarding as far as Ruburt is concerned.I cannot say this too strongly.</td><td>再说一次，约瑟，你们的亲密生活处于平稳状态，这对你们两个人最近都有帮助，就鲁柏而言，你的理解是他最大的回报。这一点我再怎么强调都不为过。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not believe that you have, that either of you have, progressed far enough to take on faith my contention that it is safe to buy your house.I can tell you that it is, but it is best that I do not push you in any direction, and that you act naturally in your own speed.</td><td>我不相信你们中的任何一人，已经进展到足以相信我的论点，亦即放心去买你们的房子。我可以告诉你们那是安全的，但我最好在各方面都不要逼你们，你们)可以按照自己的步调行事。</td></tr><tr><td>Consideration of the house did enter into Ruburt’s situation, adversely however, because of both of your fears over finances, so it was well for this reason that the move be temporarily suspended, though it does not have to be this way.</td><td>对房子的考虑确实进入了鲁伯的状况中，然而，却是不利的，因为你们俩对财务的担心，所以为此暂时搁置行动是好的，虽然不一定要这样。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt’s remark to you was indeed unfortunate, because it aroused your own fears.Independence is extremely important for both of you.You merely show it in different ways.</td><td>鲁柏对你说的话，确实很不幸，因为它引起了你自己的恐惧。独立自主对你们两人都极为重要。你们只是以不同的方式表现出来。</td></tr><tr><td>("Which remark?"</td><td>("什么话？"</td></tr><tr><td>(I thought I knew, but wanted to make sure, and it turned out I was correct.)</td><td>(我认为我知道，但想确定一下，结果证明我是对的。)</td></tr><tr><td>The remark concerning, I believe, settling for less for a while at the gallery while looking for another position, so that the house could be purchased without strain.</td><td>我相信那番话是关于，在寻找另一个工作的时候，先得过且过地待在画廊一段时间，这样买房子才不会吃力。</td></tr><tr><td>I repeat: generally speaking, I see no important difficulties immediately ahead, despite this gallery situation, and I see no financial difficulties.</td><td>我再说一遍：总的来说，尽管有这个画廊的情况，但我认为眼前没有重大的困难，也没有看到财务上的困难。</td></tr><tr><td>On another occasion I will go into the benefits and dangers of expectations, for these are the result of subconscious feelings, which are not only projected outward but also sensed by others.</td><td>在另一个时机，我将谈及期待(expectations)的好处和危险，因为这些是潜意识感受的结果，它不仅向外投射，而且也被他人感知。</td></tr><tr><td>All of our material should be of great practical value.Remember that the subconscious is at the outer end of the inner senses, and the inner senses create physical constructions.Once you learn how to handle and communicate with your subconscious, then you will be able to create more constructive constructions—</td><td>我们所有的资料都应该具有很大的实用价值。请记住，潜意识处于内在感官的外端，而内在感官创造物质建构。一旦你们学会如何处理和沟通你们的潜意识，你们就能创造更富有建设性的建构——</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane smiled.)</td><td>(此处珍笑了。)</td></tr><tr><td>—because you will understand that fearful expectations greatly color your perception of reality, and your construction of it.</td><td>——因为你们会明白，害怕的期待，严重影响你们对实相的感知，以及你们对实相的建构。</td></tr><tr><td>(To my way of thinking, this is one of the most significant bits of information to come out of the Seth material.)</td><td>(在我看来，这是赛斯资料中最重要的信息之一。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am going to end the session early.I consider it a most fruitful one.However, much of it was given to personal situations, and there is not time in any case for me to launch into other data on material this evening.</td><td>我打算早点结束这一节。我认为这是最有成果的一节。不过，内容大部分都是关于个人情况，无论如何今晚我都没有时间再谈其他有关物质的资料了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane laughed.)I very cleverly lulled Ruburt’s ego into a false sense of security, from its standpoint, and then it did not block me nearly as much as I thought it might.Ruburt will definitely benefit, and so will you if after reading this material you give him your idea concerning the situation.I have given you both an understanding of the basic situation, so that you will have it at hand to form your own decision.</td><td>(珍笑出声。)我很聪明地把鲁柏的自我哄进一个，从自我的立场看来很有安全感的错觉里，然后它就没有像我想像的那样阻拦我。鲁柏绝对会受益，你也会受益，如果读完这份资料后，你把你关于这情况的想法告诉他。我已经让你们俩对基本状况有所了解，这样你们就能随手掌握，做出你们自己的决定。</td></tr><tr><td>I bid you both a fond good evening, and Ruburt knows now how tricky I can be when the situation requires it.</td><td>祝你们两位有个美好的夜晚，鲁柏现在知道了，当情况需要时，我可以多么狡猾。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth.

yet the change was great, and I wondered if it might be even more dramatic.The presence of witnesses usually calls forth a little extra on Seth/Jane’s part as far as voice phenomenon is concerned.The 63rd session, when John Bradley had last been a witness, had also seen some voice changes; but they had been mild compared to this.)</td><td>(现在珍的声音比一分钟前更加低沉有力。这变化已经比很多其他节课的变化来得大。她的声音不是轰雷般，仍然可以听得出是她自己的声音；但变化很大，我在想是否会有更戏剧性的变化。就声音现象而言，见证人的在场，通常会引起赛斯/珍那边的额外作)用。在第63节课，约翰·布拉德利最近一次的见证课上，也有一些声音的变化；但和这次相比，那个变化是比较轻微的。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now Mark, you cannot see Josephs glass, nor can he see your glass.This can be proven mathematically, and scientists are already working with the problem, though they do not understand the principles behind it.</td><td>现在，马克，你看不到约瑟的玻璃杯，他也看不到你的玻璃杯。这可以用数学方法证明，科学家们已经在研究这个问题，虽然他们不明白背后的原理。</td></tr><tr><td>However there is a point, an infinitesimal point, where Mark’s perspective, and yours, and Ruburt's, overlap.Again, theoretically, if you could perceive that point, you could actually each see the other two physical glasses.</td><td>然而，有一个点，一个无穷小的点，在那个点上，马克的视角，你的视角，还有鲁伯的视角是重叠的。同样，从理论上讲，如果你们能感知到这一点，你们实际上可以各自看到另外两个实质的玻璃杯。</td></tr><tr><td>Physical objects simply cannot exist unless they exist in a definite perspective and space continuum.But each individual creates his own space continuum.</td><td>实质的物体根本不可能存在，除非它们存在于一个确定的视角和空间连续区中。不过每个个体都创造他自己的空间连续区。</td></tr><tr><td>These continuums exist in a positive manner.They are not illusion.They exist spontaneously and simultaneously, but no man can walk in another man’s space perspective.</td><td>这些连续区以积极的方式存在。它们不是幻觉。它们自发地同时存在，但没有人能够在另一个人的视角空间内行走。</td></tr><tr><td>I am going to tie this in with material dealing with the differences that you seem to see in one particular object.This difference is deeper than you imagine.It is not to be explained by saying that one man sees a given object differently than another because of a particular mood that may assail him.</td><td>我要把这一点与论及你们似乎在一个特定对象上看到的差异的资料联系起来。这种差异比你想像的要深。它不能被解释为，因为某种可能困扰他的心情，所以对某一特定对象的看法与另一个人不同。</td></tr><tr><td>He creates an entirely different object, which his own outer senses then perceive.Since we have here this evening such an elegant and welcome guest, let us then perceive him in terms of a slight discussion of matter, in which he shall be our guinea pig.</td><td>他创造了一个完全不同的客体，然后由他自己的外在感官来感知。既然今晚我们有这么一位优雅又受欢迎的客人，那么就让我们从对物质的略微讨论中来感知他，他将成为我们的小豚鼠(实验对象)。</td></tr><tr><td>(By referring to the floor plan of our living room at the end of this session, the placement of the three of us can be quickly determined.Seth, making the above statement, gave no suggestions as to what might transpire.Jane's delivery was unbroken as she paced about the room at a rather fast rate.Her voice was also quite strong and deep, much deeper than usual, yet she spoke without apparent effort or surprise.</td><td>(参照本节课结尾的客厅平面图，可以迅速确定我们三个人的位置。赛斯做了上面的陈述，对可能发生的情况，没有给出任何暗示。珍以相当快的速度在房间里踱步，她的传述没有间断。她的声音也相当有力和低沉，比平时要低沉得多，但她说话时却没有明显的努力和惊讶。</td></tr><tr><td>(From my writing table, to my right of the entrance to our bath, I could look easily at Bill as he sat in our Kennedy rocker, facing the bath entrance itself from the other side of the same door.As Jane continued her delivery I noticed that Bill was staring quite consistently into the open bath doorway; yet I did not pay great attention to this, taking it somewhat for granted that Seth would use Bill/Mark only as a talking point relating to whatever subject he discussed.)</td><td>(从我的写字台，在我们浴室入口的右边，我可以很容易地看到比尔，因为他坐在我们的甘迺迪摇椅上，从同一扇门的另一边，面对着浴室入口。珍继续她的传讯，我注意到比尔一直盯着敞开的浴室门口；但我并没有太关注这件事，我理所当然地认为，赛斯只是要把比尔/马克作为与他所讨论的话题有关的一个谈话点。)</td></tr><tr><td>You perceive Mark, Joseph, sitting in your chair.He sits in his own chair, which he has constructed in his own space continuum and personal perspective.</td><td>约瑟，你感知马克坐在你们的椅子上。其实他是坐在他自己的椅子上，这是他在他自己的空间连续区和个人视角中建构的。</td></tr><tr><td>You and Ruburt perceive Mark, and yet neither of you sees Mark’s Mark.As he sits in his chair, constantly he creates his own image physically, using his own psychic energy, and using particular atoms and molecules for the construction of his body.</td><td>你和鲁柏感知着马克，但你们谁也没有看见马克的马克。当他坐在椅子上时，他不断地用他自己的灵性能)量创造他自己的身体形象，用特定的原子和分子来建构他的身体。</td></tr><tr><td>We have here then so far one Mark, constructed by himself; and before the evening is through you will be amazed at how many Marks we end up with.</td><td>那么到目前为止，我们在这里有一个马克，是由他自己建构的，在今晚结束之前，你们会对最终有多少马克大吃一惊。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your first break, and mark my words, Mark: You are more than you know.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下，马克，记住我的话：你比你知道的还要多。</td></tr><tr><td>Incidentally, I would like particular attention for the session, as the material will be of particular value.</td><td>顺便说一句，我希望大家特别关注这节课，因为这些资料将具有特殊的价值。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26.Jane was dissociated as usual.</td><td>(9:26分休息。珍解离如常。</td></tr><tr><td>(As soon as break arrived Bill announced that he had seen an image in the doorway of the bath; it was this that had drawn his attention as Jane dictated.Bill asked for a sheet of paper and immediately set to work on a sketch of what he had seen.He is an artist and schoolteacher.</td><td>(一到休息时间，比尔就说，他在浴室门口看到了一个影像；在珍传述期间，就是这个影像引起了他的注意。比尔要了一张纸，马上开始为他所看到的画了一张速写。他是一位艺术家兼教师。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane and I of course looked into the doorway but saw nothing.Bill has seen many images and apparitions during his life, and Seth has in past sessions discussed some of them, and their origin, briefly; so Jane and I were not surprised when Bill said he had another sighting.</td><td>(珍和我当然也往浴室门口看去，但什么也没看见。比尔在他的一生中见过很多影像和幽灵，赛斯在过去的课程中，也曾简单地讨论过其中的一些，以及它们的来源；所以当比尔说他有一个目击事件时，珍和我并不感到惊讶。</td></tr><tr><td>(For one who felt poorly at the start of the session, Jane now said she felt fine.Seth had "knocked her out quickly." Our cat, Willy, now became active as break wore on, and as he has done for most recent sessions.Willy began to stalk through the apartment, crying out; it was a cool night and no bugs were to be seen.Willy behaved in quite a scary fashion, looking all about him.</td><td>(对于一个在课程开始时感觉很差的人，珍现在说她感觉很好。赛斯"很快就把她敲昏了"。我们的猫，威利，休息时开始变得活跃起来，就像牠最近几节课所做的那样。牠开始在公寓里到处出没，大声嘶叫；这是一个凉爽的夜晚，看不到任何飞虫。威利的表现相当吓人，四处张望。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane began dictating again in the same strong and very deep voice.Bill continued working on his sketch, saying he was not satisfied with it and would try another.Resume at 9:32.)</td><td>(珍以同样有力且低沉的声音再次开始传述。比尔继续画他的草图，他说他不满意，要再划一张。9:32继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will have something to say about William's apparition shortly.</td><td>关于威廉的幽灵，我很快就会谈到。</td></tr><tr><td>First of all, I would like you to notice that Ruburt’s voice is somewhat lower; and then with your permission I will continue.</td><td>首先，我希望大家注意到，鲁伯的声音低沉了一些；然后在大家的允许下，我将继续。</td></tr><tr><td>While Mark creates his own image, you seem to see his image, but you do not see it.At this particular time there are three entirely different Marks in this room, although I use the term "this room" very loosely.</td><td>当马克创造他自己的形象时，你们似乎看到了他的形象，但你们并没有看到它。就在这个特定的时间，这个房间里有三个完全不同的马克，不过我是以很宽松的方式用"这个房间"这个词。</td></tr><tr><td>(First Jane pointed at Bill as he sat in the Kennedy rocker, working on his sketch of the apparition; then she pointed at me.Bill in the meantime kept staring into the open bath doorway, and as before I could see nothing from my position at the table.)</td><td>(珍先是指着比尔，因为他坐在甘迺迪的摇椅上，正在画他的幽灵草图；然后她指着我。与此同时，比尔一直盯着敞开的浴室门口，我则像先前一样，从我桌)子的位置什么也看不到。)</td></tr><tr><td>There is the Mark which Mark has created, an actual physical construction.There is another Mark does not see, and this Mark is an actual physical construction created by you.There are at this time still two more physical Marks, one created by Ruburt, and one created by your cat.</td><td>有一个马克是马克所创造的，一个真实的物质建构。有另一个是没有看见的马克，这个马克是你创造的一个真实的物质建构。此时还有两个实质的马克，一个是鲁柏创造的马克，另一个是你们的猫威利创造的马克。</td></tr><tr><td>If another person entered the room, there would still be another physical Mark.</td><td>如果有另一个人进入这个房间，仍然会有另一个实质的马克。</td></tr><tr><td>In this room, so to speak, there are four physical Ruburts, there are four physical Josephs, and there are four physical cats.There are indeed four rooms.</td><td>在这个房间里，可以说，有四个实质的鲁柏，有四个实质的约瑟，还有四个实质的猫。确实有四个房间。</td></tr><tr><td>(From my studio at the back of the apartment came Willies cry.He was still stalking about.)</td><td>(从我公寓后面的工作室传来威利的叫声。他还在四处走动观察。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your friend Mark, to digress, is an excellent witness in one way, because he is sensitive to appearances and constructions that appear within the physical realm from other planes.</td><td>说个题外话，你们的朋友马克，他在某方面是个极佳的见证人，因为他对来自其他层面，而出现在物质领域的显像和建构很敏感。</td></tr><tr><td>His span of attention in one respect is short.As far as his psychic energy is concerned he is very gifted.I did, indeed, stand momentarily in the doorway; though if I may say so—</td><td>他在一个方面的注意力跨度很短。就他的灵性能量而言，他很有天赋。我的确是在门口站了一会儿，不过，如果我可以这样说的话——</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane paused beside Bill and picked up the first pen drawing he had made of his sighting of the apparition of Seth.)</td><td>(这时，珍在比尔身边停了下来，拿起了比尔为所看到的赛斯幽灵而画的第一张铅笔画。)</td></tr><tr><td>—I am a much more cheerful-looking fellow than here portrayed.You missed a certain cast along what you may call the cheekbones; and if you watch the image closer, I may be able to make it clearer.</td><td>——我是一个比这里所画的要更欢快的家伙。你在你们称之为颧骨的那里少画了些阴影；如果你靠近一点看那个影像，我也许能让它变得更清晰。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane handed the sketch back to Bill, who continued to stare into the dark bath doorway.)</td><td>(珍把草图递还给比尔，比尔继续盯着黑暗的浴室门口。)</td></tr><tr><td>This is the first time that I have attempted to approach in this manner during a session.I am pleased that I have been perceived, and I have been observing you from my own vantage point.</td><td>这是我第一次尝试在课中用这种方法。我很高兴我被感知到，我一直在从我自己有利的位置观察你们。</td></tr><tr><td>The image in the doorway is indeed my own, though there is bound to be a distortion in Mark’s perception of me.It is through the inner senses that he perceives me, and this data he then attempts to transform into information that can be perceived by the outer senses.</td><td>门口的影像的确是我自己的影像，然而马克感知到的我必然有扭曲之处。他是透过内在感官来感知我，然后他试图把这个资料转换成外在感官可以感知的信息。</td></tr><tr><td>The construction is one of those that I have said is usually unperceived, and therefore does not exist as a rule in terms of physical time or space.</td><td>这种建构是我说过的通常不被感知的建构之一，因此就物理时间或空间的规则而言，它不存在。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane stood in back of Bill, looking over his shoulder as he sketched.)</td><td>(现在，珍站在比尔身后，从他的肩膀上方看他画着草图。)</td></tr><tr><td>There is a smugness about the lips—very good—that I am indeed rather pleased with.You will find that this construction is being created by myself.Just to appear on your plane, any construction, whether perceived by you or not, must be composed of atoms and molecules.</td><td>嘴上有一股自鸣得意——非常好——我确实相当满意。你会发现这个建构是由我自己创造的。只是为了显现在你们的层面上，任何建构，无论是否被你们感知到，都一定是由原子和分子组成。</td></tr><tr><td>The motion and the speed varies from regular constructions.I am in this particular instance speaking through Ruburt while I have also stood by in a construction and watched him speak.At a later date I may be able, briefly, to speak from my own construction.But this will take training and I will need the use of much cooperation.</td><td>动态和速度与一般的建构不同。在这个特定的例子中，我通过鲁伯说话，同时我也站在一个建构中看着他说话。日后，我也许能够，从我自己的建构中简短地说几句。但这需要训练，我需要用到很多合作。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane picked the second sketch from Bill’s hand and paced about the room, talking as she examined it.I caught a glimpse of the drawing as she waved it briefly in my direction.)</td><td>(珍从比尔手中接过第二张草图，在房间里踱来踱去，边看边说。当她朝我的方向挥了挥那张画时，我瞥见了那幅画。)</td></tr><tr><td>I also intend to speak briefly on Ruburt’s Tom Roberts.</td><td>我还打算简单地谈一谈鲁伯的汤姆-罗伯茨。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true I am in some ways no beauty on your terms, and yet you will attest I am not altogether ugly.I will let you take your break.And I wish to thank Mark.When I said that Mark would join me in a demonstration, I meant that Mark would join me in a demonstration.</td><td>在你们看来，我在某方面确实不算好看，然而你们也能证明，我并不算太难看。我让你们休息一下。我想要谢谢马克。当我说马克会和我一起示范时，我的意)思就是，马克会和我一起示范。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:56.Jane was dissociated as usual.She ended the dialogue with a laugh at Bill.</td><td>(9:56休息。珍解离如常。她对着比尔笑着，结束了对话。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill Macdonnel said that the dark bath doorway turned into a foggy white; he then saw the form of Seth's apparition stand out against this lighter background.The form was mainly a silhouette, he said, without much detail; yet during the first monologue he obtained a strong look or glimpse of the face.The effect was rather like that of a reversed negative.Bill said the face of the apparition was about six feet above floor level.</td><td>(比尔·麦克唐纳说，黑暗的浴室门口变成了雾状的白色；然后他看到赛斯的幽灵的形状，在这一浅色的背景下，显得格外突出。他说，那形式主要是一个轮廓，没有太多细节；然而在第一段独白中，他清楚看到或瞥见那张脸。这种效果颇像反转的底片。比尔说，幽灵的脸离地面大约六英呎高。</td></tr><tr><td>(It was while we were discussing dimensions that the second part of Seth’s demonstration took place; and again it was without suggestion upon his part, or indeed warning of any kind.</td><td>(当我们正在讨论尺寸时，赛斯示范的第二部分发生了；同样的，赛斯没有给出任何暗示或警示。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane by now felt very good, fully recovered from her below-par feeling preceding the session.Clowning around, she moved into the doorway, into the exact spot in which, Bill said, Seth 's apparition was appearing.At this time, this moment, Bill said he could not see the image.I was standing beside the rocker Bill occupied, and both of us were watching Jane as she stood smiling and laughing in the bath doorway.</td><td>(珍现在感觉非常好，完全从课前的低迷状态中恢复过来。她闹着玩地走着，走到浴室门口，走到比尔说的赛斯的幽灵出现的那个确切的位置。在这个时候，这个时刻，比尔说他看不到那个影像了。我就站在比尔坐的那张摇椅旁边，我们俩都在看着珍，她正笑盈盈地站在浴室门口。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill Macdonnel and I then noticed at the same time that Jane's animated features were changing.As she spoke to us, her jaw became more square in outline against her long black hair; her nose enlarged, her mouth acquired heavier and wider lips as they moved with her speech, and her neck thickened.The whole cast of feature became heavier and male.Neither Bill or myself noted any change in her eyes or forehead.</td><td>(接着，比尔和我同时注意到，珍动态的容貌发生了变化。当她对我们说话时，她的下巴在长长的黑发的衬托下变得更加方正；她的鼻子变大了，她的嘴在说话的同时，变得更大、更宽，脖子也变粗了。整个容貌特征变得厚重且男性化。比尔和我都没有注意到她的眼睛或额头有任何变化。</td></tr><tr><td>(At our request Jane remained standing where she was; she said that she "tingled" as she stood in the proper spot.She was not frightened, although uneasy when Bill and I first told her of what we saw.There was no doubt of what we did see.The effect lasted for perhaps a minute or two, the room was sufficiently well lighted [although not blazing with light; during her deliveries Jane usually has one 60W light on, but at break we turn more lights on; and if this bothers Jane while talking she automatically snaps them off as she paces about.] and Bill and I had plenty of chance to make sure of what we were looking at.</td><td>(应我们的要求，珍继续站在原地；她说当她站在那个位置时，她感觉"刺刺的"。她并不害怕，尽管在我和比尔第一次告诉她我们看到的情况时，她很不安。我们确实看到了什么，这是毫无疑问的。这个效果，持续了或许一两分钟，房间里光线充足，[虽然不是灯火通明；在珍传讯时，她通常开着一盏60瓦的灯，但在休息时，我们会打开更多的灯；如果这让珍在说话时感到刺眼，她就会在踱步时自动把灯关掉]，比尔和我有足够的机会确定我们看到的是什么。</td></tr><tr><td>(I then asked Jane to move a few inches forward.She did, and the effect diminished then disappeared.For me, the change in feature appeared to take place on a plane an inch or so in front of Jane's actual physical features.This new set of features might have been suspended on a clear screen of some kind; and as I watched them, at the same time I saw or sensed behind them or through them Jane's real features as I knew them.Bill Macdonnel did not dispute my interpretation of the effect, although I have the feeling he did not see the effect just that way.</td><td>(然后我要求珍往前移几寸。她照做了，效果减弱，然后消失了。对我来说，特征的变化似乎发生在珍的实际身体特征前面一英寸左右的层面上。这组新的特征可能是悬挂在某种透明的屏幕上；当我看着它们时，同时我也能看到或感觉到，在它们背后，或穿过它们，看到我知道的珍的真正面貌特征。比尔没有反驳我对这个效果的解读，不过我感觉他看到的效果并不只是那样。</td></tr><tr><td>(This "hanging before" appearance, it will be remembered, is remarkably similar to the effect I observed when the same three of us experimented with our first and only seance.See the 11th session, page 56.In this one, as Bill, Jane and I stared into a mirror, the reflection of Jane’s head changed in size and shape, and finally appeared to hang in space just forward of the rest of her reflection.That appearance had taken place in much poorer light than tonight’s event, however.This time I could see in detail the changes taking place, and their end. [Session 11 is in Vol. 1.]</td><td>(关于这个"悬挂在前的"外形，它让我们想起，这和我们第一次，也是唯一的一次降神会看到的效果非常相似。请参见第11节课。那一次，比尔，珍和我凝视着一面镜子，珍的头部大小和形状在镜中起了变化，最后，看起来好像悬挂在她其余部分的正前方。不过那天晚上的光线比今晚的微弱得多。这一次我可以很清楚看见那些变化与结果。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill told Jane and me that the "feeling" of the apparitions form lingered in the doorway even during break, though in a weaker state.He said that the image would at intervals become quite a bit stronger, so that he could then glimpse details.His drawings of Seth revealed a set of rather chiseled features, with the obvious difference of a very large and high cranium.He said he felt the cranium was gigantic.</td><td>(比尔告诉珍和我，即使在休息的时候，那幽灵形式的"感觉"仍在门口徘徊，只是在比较弱的状态。他说，这个影象，每隔一段时间就会变强一些，所以他就能看到细节。他画的赛斯，显示了一组轮廓分明的特征，明显的区别是头盖骨很大很高。他说他觉得这个头颅很巨大。</td></tr><tr><td>(I will have photocopies of the two drawings made for insertion into the carbon copies of this record.My personal feeling is that Seth’s enormous cranium in the drawings is a symbolic one—perhaps one pertaining to Bill’s feeling that Seth possesses greater or different knowledge than we do.</td><td>(我会把这两幅画复印下来，当作这份记录的插图。我个人的感觉是，画中赛斯巨大的头颅是一种象征——也许是一个与比尔的感觉有关的象征，即赛斯拥有比我们更伟大或不同的知识。</td></tr><tr><td>(Still not satisfied with his second sketch, Bill set to work to make a few small changes.Willy had quieted down by now.My writing hand felt no fatigue to speak of.Jane began dictating in the same strong and very deep voice.Indeed, she kept up with the voice phenomenon for the whole session, with no apparent discomfort of any kind, and no ill effects afterward.Resume at 10:08.)</td><td>(比尔对他的第二张草图仍不满意，着手修改了几个小地方。威利现在已经安静下来。我写字的手没有感到任何疲惫。珍以同样有力和非常低沉的声音传述。事实上，她整节课都一直保持着这种声音的现象，没有任何明显的不适，而且之后也没有任何不适的影响。10:08继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>There is no good reason why you could not see me also, Joseph, nor is there any reason why Ruburt could not see me.You are both quite fussy about what you will see and what you will not see.This we will go into later in some detail.</td><td>约瑟，你没有什么充分的理由看不到我，鲁伯也没有任何理由看不到我。你们对什么会看到，什么不会看到，都是相当挑剔的。这一点我们稍后再详谈。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again Jane picked up Bill 's second sketch.Pacing around the room at a rather fast rate, she studied it and pointed to it frequently as she spoke.)</td><td>(珍又拿起比尔的第二张草图。用相当快的速度在房间里踱步，一边研究，一边频频指着它说话。)</td></tr><tr><td>The chin is shaped somewhat differently than the second sketch.It is not so pointed, though it is as long.I am, nevertheless, pleased with the overall representation.It is simply that for many reasons Mark's abilities have been developed along these lines.</td><td>下巴的形状和第二张草图的有点不太一样。虽然下巴一样长，但没那么尖。不过，我对整体的呈现还是很满意的。反正基于各种原因，马克的能力是沿着这方面发展的。</td></tr><tr><td>It is a natural talent, although it is as yet untrained.With training his ability here could be spectacular.I will however make this statement:The picture—</td><td>这是一种天赋，但它还没有经过训练。经过训练，他在这里的能力可能会很惊人。不过，我还是要做这样的声明。这幅画...</td></tr><tr><td>(Holding the sketch up, Jane waved it in my direction.)</td><td>(举起那张草图，珍朝我的方向挥了挥。)</td></tr><tr><td>—represents an outward transformation as Mark attempted to construct an accurate replica of material that he sensed with the inner senses, and as such it is the reconstruction of what I am.It represents the appearance that these abilities of mine take when at all closely connected with the physical plane.This does not necessarily mean that in all planes I have the same image.</td><td>——代表着一种往外的转换，因为马克试图用他从内在感官知觉到的资料，向外建构出一个准确的复制品，因此它是对我的重建。它代表了我的这些能力在与物质层面紧密相连时的外观。这并不一定意味着在)所有的层面上我都有相同的形象。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane gestured toward Bill. She was pacing very fast and her deep voice was booming out.)</td><td>(珍向比尔打了个手势。她踱步的速度很快，低沉的声音轰隆而出。)</td></tr><tr><td>It is the first such representation of me, and I am quite fond of it.</td><td>这是第一张代表我的画作，我很喜欢它。</td></tr><tr><td>I would not be surprised if you wondered about the part that suggestion might play in such a demonstration.I spoke of a demonstration without mentioning what sort of a demonstration.Before the fact, I mentioned no apparitions.</td><td>如果你们想知道在这样的示范中，暗示可能扮演的角色，我不会感到惊讶。我提到了示范，但没有提到是什么样的示范。事前我没有提到幽灵。</td></tr><tr><td>Generally speaking however, no physical object can be constructed, and no action can occur, without what you are pleased to call suggestion.No action and no material object can be perceived without inner consent and willingness.Behind every action and every construction there is indeed what you are pleased to call suggestion.</td><td>然而，一般来说，如果没有你们乐意称之为的暗示(suggestion)，任何实物都无法被建构，任何行动都无法发生。如果没有内在的同意和意愿，任何行动和任何物质客体都无法被感知。在每一个行动和每一个建构背后，确实存在着你们喜称的暗示。</td></tr><tr><td>Suggestion is no more and no less than an inner willingness and consent, to allow a particular action to occur; and this consent is the trigger which sets off the subconscious mechanisms that allow you to construct inner data into physical reality.</td><td>暗示不外乎是一种内在的意愿和同意，它让特定的行动发生；而这种同意是触发器，它启动了潜意识机制，让你们把内在的资料建构成物质实相。</td></tr><tr><td>There is no more truth, and no more falsehood, in saying that my appearance in the doorway was caused by suggestion, than to say that this room and everything within it is caused by suggestion.</td><td>说我出现在门口是暗示的结果，跟说这个房间与房间内的所有东西是暗示的结果一样，没有更多的真实，也没有更多的虚假。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill Macdonnel was again staring into the doorway to the bath, making additions to his second drawing of Seth's apparition.)</td><td>(比尔再次盯着浴室门口，在他的第二张赛斯幽灵画上添了几笔。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your emotional feelings are, as you know, the inner senses as they appear close to the physical plane.These are the directives.You form in your own personal perspective the data that exists within the inner self, but you do this on an individual basis in line with your own expectations, suggestions and attitudes.</td><td>你们的情绪感受，如你们所知，是靠近物质层面的内在感官。这些是指令。你们以个人的视角形成存在于内在自己之内的资料，但你们是在个人的基础上，按照自己的期待、暗示和态度来做的。</td></tr><tr><td>These very often distort inner data so that unreliable and even loathsome constructions are formed.This is of great importance.</td><td>这些往往会扭曲内在的资料，从而形成不可靠，甚至令人厌恶的建构。这一点非常重要。</td></tr><tr><td>I would also suggest before the session ends that you ask Mark once more what he saw, for the record, as well as including the excellent representation of me in the record.I also suggest that you notice the change once again in Ruburt’s voice; and if I perhaps sound severe, it is only the result of the transition.I can do best along this line in the presence of particular individuals who cooperate with me in the effort.</td><td>我还建议在课程结束前，你们再问一次马克他看到了什么，以备记录，同时把我这幅绝佳的画像放在记录中。我还建议你们再次注意到鲁伯声音的变化；如果我听起来很严厉，那只是转换造成的结果。在有特定的个人努力配合的情况下，我可以在这方面表现得最)好。</td></tr><tr><td>Also a brief notice: Your doctor across the way even now looked up and saw me, as he has done upon various occasions.And yet this time he knew that something was different, and sensed the proximity.</td><td>另外，简短的通知一下：你们对面的医生甚至现在还在抬着头看，并看到我，他有几次这么做。但这一次他知道有什么不一样，他感受到我在附近。</td></tr><tr><td>(I had heard a door slam next door, since it was a nice night and our living room windows were open.In the summer Jane likes the windows open, sessions or no, although I find traffic noises bothersome at times.</td><td>(我听到隔壁有关门声，因为那是一个美好的夜晚，我们客厅的窗户是打开的。夏天的时候，珍喜欢开着窗户，不管有没有上课，虽然我觉得交通噪音有时很扰人。</td></tr><tr><td>(We live on the second floor.The offices of Dr. Levine, our friend and physician, are perhaps forty feet away, on the ground floor of a house that he owns.The side entrance to his suite is directly opposite our windows, and we often see Sam Levine coming and going.He does much night work, and his office lights have many times been burning while a session was in progress.</td><td>(我们住在二楼。莱文医生(Dr.Levine)是我们的朋友和医生，他的办公室离我们大概有40英呎远，就在他拥有的一栋房子的底层。他的套房的侧门正对着我们的窗户，我们经常看到山姆·莱文(SamLevine)进进出出。他常常在晚上工作，我们上课时，他的办公室时常灯火通明。</td></tr><tr><td>(Sam Levine knows about Seth but has never attended a session.He has been invited to.He has expressed neither belief nor disbelief, he has also listened to part of the tape recording we made of Jane when delivering the 25th session.Someday Jane and I intend to put the pressure on Sam and make him attend a session, no matter how busy he is.

and with the abilities that you are developing, you brought psychic mass force, which is valid mass force, even in your physical world, against the door and opened it.</td><td>有很多事情需要解释。恰好在同一时刻，你们都强烈地希望那扇门能打开；而你们正在开发的能力，带来了灵性的聚力(massforce)，即使在你们的物质世界，那也是有效的聚力，对着门，打开了它。</td></tr><tr><td>(This was a surprise.Jane and I finally got around to going on a drive to look at the house, about which we had known for several weeks without bothering to investigate.Going up a very steep dirt road just outside Elmira, by luck we took the correct fork in the road and pulled into the front yard of the right house.We liked it at first sight.</td><td>(这是个惊喜。珍和我终于有机会开车去看那栋房子，我们知道这栋房子已经好几个星期，却一直没有去查看。开往艾尔米拉郊外的一条非常陡峭的土路上，我们很幸运选择了正确的岔道，把车开进了那栋房子的前院。我们第一眼就喜欢上了它。</td></tr><tr><td>(We found the front door locked and bolted, then spent a few minutes looking around the front half of the place, and admiring the view.It then occurred to me to walk around back to see if the back door was also locked.Jane had the same idea, though we thought little of it at the time.And we did find the back porch door open.It had no outside lock, but was locked from the inside by a bolt arrangement.</td><td>(我们发现前门锁住并上了闩，然后花了几分钟环顾这地方的前半部分，欣赏了一下这里的风景。然后我突然想绕到后面，去看看后门是否也锁着。珍也有同样的想法，不过当时我们也没多想。我们真的发现后阳台的门开着。它的外面没有锁，而是从里面上了门)闩。</td></tr><tr><td>(According to Seth then, Jane and I used our combined psychic strength or force to pull the bolt back.I remember finding the door, which was very heavy and thick, slightly ajar.This was accounted for to our satisfaction at the time of our second visit; trying to shoot the bolt from inside the porch, Jane and I found we had to exert considerable pressure against the door in order to line the bolt up with the door frame; and once shut the door was exceedingly sturdy.If Jane and I used psychic strength to open this door, it can be safely stated that the force required and exerted was considerable.)</td><td>(那么，按照赛斯的说法，珍和我用我们聚合的灵性力道或力量，合力把门栓拉了起来。我记得发现那扇又厚又重的门时，它是微开着的。这一点在我们第二次来的时候就得到了满意的交代；试着从门廊内拉上门栓，珍和我发现，我们必须对门施加相当大的压力，才能使门栓与门框对准；而一旦关上，门就极其牢固。如果我和珍用灵性力量打开这扇门，可以肯定地说，所需的力量和施加的力量是相当大的。)</td></tr><tr><td>All of your friends sensed that this house was good for you both.I am no banker.Nevertheless, I can tell you that you will have no financial difficulties; nor should Ruburt feel any fear concerning his own job at the gallery, in terms of the house and finances.</td><td>你们所有的朋友都感觉到，这栋房子对你们俩都好。我不是银行家。不过，我可以告诉你们，你们不会有财务困难；鲁柏也不应为了房子和经济问题，而对自己在画廊的工作感到任何担忧。</td></tr><tr><td>("Were Jane and I on the property when we used this psychic force to open the door?")</td><td>("我们用这股灵力开门的时候，珍和我当时在房子那里吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>At the actual property?</td><td>在实际的那栋房子那里？</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes, did we use this ability while we were there in front of the house?"</td><td>("是的，我们是在房子前面使用了这个能力吗？"</td></tr><tr><td>(I was wondering whether perhaps we had opened the door while on the way to the house, maybe as we climbed the dirt road.)</td><td>(我在想，也许我们是在去房子的路上开的门，或许是在开上土路的时候。)</td></tr><tr><td>You were in front of the house.There is a short bit here.I will say it while Ruburt is not blocking me.You have both built up psychic reserves which you have not even glimpsed.The change in inner attitude, on your part particularly, toward the outside world, has in turn created a different sort of outside world, and a more beneficial one than you knew earlier.</td><td>你们在房子的前面。这里有一小段补充。趁着鲁伯没阻拦我，我就说吧。你们都积累了自己甚至都未曾瞥见过的灵性储备。尤其是你们的内在对外界态度的改变，反倒创造了一种不同的外在世界，而且是比你们先前认识的更有利的外在世界。</td></tr><tr><td>This is a direct result of the results of inner expectations, and begins to yield its fruits.Changes in your living rhythm will no longer confront you in terms of either bitterness, anger or regret, for you are creating a more constructive material and psychic environment.</td><td>这是内在期待之结果的直接结果，并开始产生成果。你们生活节奏的变化，将不再让你们面临苦涩、愤怒或懊悔，因为你们正在创造一个更具建设性的物质与灵性环境。</td></tr><tr><td>You have nothing to fear financially as far as Ruburt’s position at the gallery; his outside condition in the world will improve; again, because of inner expectation.Whether this improvement takes place in connection with the gallery, or whether it takes place in another working area makes no difference, and need not worry nor concern you.</td><td>你们完全不用担心鲁柏在画廊的工作会影响你们的财务状况；他在世间的外在条件将得到改善；再次地，这是由于内在的期待。无论这种改善的发生是与画廊)有关，还是发生在另一个工作领域，都没有区别，你们不用担心跟在意。</td></tr><tr><td>There will be no long period when he is not employed.I have been doing so well this evening;

but the gestalt could not operate consistently or endure for any amount of physical time, in your field, because of the absence here of the greater data which is the property of the whole self, in its construction of a completed human form.This will take some reading over.Certain conditions, which we will discuss at length later, are necessary for a completely valid or effective materialization into human form.</td><td>它是由真实物质组成的。你们应该知道，和其他所有的原子和分子一样，幽灵的原子和分子也有囊括性的理解力，广泛性的意识。它们在马克的敦促下，形成了一个物质建构的完形；但在你们的场域里，这个完形无法在任何物理时间内持续地运作或维持，因为这里缺少建构一个完整人类形态的更多资料，这些资料是整体自己的属性。这得花些时间读取。要物质化为完整有效的人类形态，某些条件是必需的，我们将在后面详细讨论。</td></tr><tr><td>The discussion on matter will still involve us in many more sessions.Such an apparition however is composed of legitimate matter, and involves value fulfillment on the part of the atoms and molecules that compose it.</td><td>有关物质的讨论还需要用上我们很多节课。无论如何，这样一个幽灵是由实实在在的物质组成，并涉及组成它的原子与分子的值的充盈。</td></tr><tr><td>("Are apparitions very common?")</td><td>("幽灵是很常见的吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>The question confuses me.They are more common than people suppose—</td><td>我不太清楚这个问题。它们比人们想象的更为常见—</td></tr><tr><td>("That’s what I meant.")</td><td>("我就是这个意思"。)</td></tr><tr><td>—and the more complete they are, the less they are realized as apparitions.Other reasons are found to rationalize away their existence.</td><td>——它们建构得越完整，就越是不被人意识到是幽灵。还可找到其他原因来合理化它们的不存在。</td></tr><tr><td>I am pleased about the house as you know, and you will both benefit in unknown ways.I am, as I mentioned and as Ruburt surmised, going to keep you but briefly.</td><td>你们也知道，我对房子的事很高兴，你们都会以不明的方式受益。正如我提到的，也如鲁伯所猜测的，我要再耽搁你们一下，但就一下子。</td></tr><tr><td>I am enthusiastic still, over the accomplishments of our previous session.</td><td>我对我们上节课的成就仍然兴高采烈。</td></tr><tr><td>("Have you ever materialized to such an extent before?")</td><td>("你以前有过这样程度的具体化吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>Not on your plane.</td><td>不在你们的层面上。</td></tr><tr><td>("What about those fragments you said Jane and I created at York Beach, Maine, last August?Were they apparitions?"</td><td>("那么你说珍和我去年八月在缅因州约克海滨创造的那些片段呢？他们是幽灵吗？"</td></tr><tr><td>(See the 9th session, December 18/63, page 43, in Volume 1.)</td><td>(见第9课，1963年12月18日。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have told you they were fragments, and if you will reread the material in the light of the newer material on matter, then the whole incident will become more plain to you.I also will tie these discussions in with their strong connection with expectation, as the involvement here is extremely practical in everyday terms;

the pressure of one ankle upon the other being unmistakable.</td><td>(7月14日，星期二，晚上8:45：这次经历显然可以提供一些不同的东西。当我达到理想的状态时，我开)始感觉到我的腿在脚踝处是交叉的，但理智上，我很确定腿并没有交叉着。这感觉很不一样，而且很明确；一边的脚踝压在另一边的感觉不可能会错的。</td></tr><tr><td>(While this sensation was developing, I heard many scattered indefinite sounds, music and voices, and had some exceedingly brief flashes of people in various postures, all too vague to identify.</td><td>(在这种感觉正在发展的同时，我听到许多零星而不确定的声音，音乐和说话声，还有一些非常短暂的各种姿势的人的画面闪现，所有的画面都模糊得无法识别。</td></tr><tr><td>(Then, the feeling of crossed limbs developed in my hands.Although as I lay on my back with my hands at my sides, and knew my hands were so positioned, I began to have the feeling that they were crossed at the wrist and lying upon my waist.This feeling became most definite and unmistakable, and indeed stronger than it was in my ankles.Finally it became so definite that it required a formal act of will on my part to prevent myself from definitely moving my hands to make sure they were not crossed upon my waist.</td><td>(接着，肢体交叉的感觉出现在我的两只手上。虽然我仰面躺在床上，双手放在两侧，知道自己的双手是在这样的位置，却开始觉得它们是放在我的腰上且手腕交叉。这感觉变得非常明确，不可能有错，甚至变得比脚踝交叉的感觉更强烈。最后，它变得如此明确，以至于我需要动用我的意志力，来阻止自己一定要移动我的手，来确保它们没有在我的腰部交叉。</td></tr><tr><td>(I did verify that they lay at my sides, however, simply by exerting a slight enough pressure downward, against the bed, to be able to feel the bed.The sensation lasted for some few minutes, much long enough to be sure of verification.It became quite diversified then, and once again I had the peculiar sensation of being in existence upon two levels at once.I have experienced this sensation a few times before, but not in just this manner.This may be a significant experience; I have the intuitive feeling it represents a definite attempt at psychic travel on my part.</td><td>(我还是确认了一下，它们的确在我身体的两侧，我只是稍微用力向下压了一下床。那感觉持续了几分钟，时间长到足以确认。然后，它变得相当多样化，我又再次感觉到同时在两个不同的高度上。这种感觉我之前也曾经历过几次，但不是以这种方式。这可能是个很重要的经验；我的直觉是，它代表了我对灵性旅行的一种明确的尝试。</td></tr><tr><td>(Wed. 7/15, 8:15 PM:A few results;

that is, consciousness can never fully construct itself in matter, and to do so would indeed imprison such a consciousness so that it could not escape the transient nature of matter itself.</td><td>这样的主建构使意识能够在物质世界中运作、操纵和被感知。就实现内在目的而言，意识的物质建构永远不可能是完整的；也就是说，意识永远无法将自己完全建构成物质，如果这样做，确实会禁锢这样的意识，使它无法摆脱物质自身本质上的短暂性。</td></tr><tr><td>Even a primary construction, therefore, is but a partial appearance of inner nature into matter.The term consciousness, as I am here using it, may need some explanation, although you should by now understand my meaning.</td><td>所以，即使是主建构，也只是内在本质转化成物质的部分显现。我在这里使用的"意识"一词，可能需要一些解释，尽管你们现在应该明白我的意思。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's delivery had by now slowed up considerably; she began to take long pauses between phrases.It appeared that this session would be another of the kind wherein Seth tries very hard to make accurate points; they usually leave Jane quite tired.While delivering the material she appears to search very carefully for just the right word.)</td><td>(珍的传述现在已经大大放慢了速度，她开始在字句之间做长长的停顿。这似乎又是一节赛斯极力想表达精准陈述的课；这通常让珍相当疲惫。在传述资料)时，珍似乎在非常小心地搜寻正确的用字。)</td></tr><tr><td>What you consider your consciousness, or your self, or your thinking ego, represents of course only one portion of your entire consciousness, that part which you are using at this time.It is as if, for example, consciousness of any whole self were compared to a huge, and indeed almost infinite light, with the ability inherent in the light to focus in many directions; to be diffused, as if the light had many switches that would turn it to greater or lesser intensities and directions.</td><td>你们所认为的，你的意识，或你的自己，或你的思维自我，当然只代表你整个意识的一部分，即你们此时正在使用的那一部分。这就好比，例如，任何整体自己的意识被比作一束巨大的、事实上几乎是无限的光，这束光固有的能力，可以在许多方向上聚焦；可以扩散，就好比这束光有许多开关，可以把它转为较大或较小的强度和方向。</td></tr><tr><td>Some conditions, some roads and countries, would require different beams to meet different circumstances, as even in automobiles you use high beams or low beams according to necessity or utility; and in some cases the high beams would not only be ineffective but dangerous, and so low beams are used.</td><td>有些情况，有些道路和乡村，需要不同强弱的光线以应对不同的环境，即使是你们在开车的时候，也会依照实际需要，使用远光或近光；在某些情况下，远光不仅没有效果，而且还很危险，所以你们使用近光。</td></tr><tr><td>So the whole self turns various portions of its whole consciousness on or off, according to the field in which the whole self is endeavoring to make contact, manipulations, and according to the field in which he is endeavoring to project himself.</td><td>所以，整体自己根据自己努力接触、操纵的场域，根据自己努力投射的场域，将自己整体意识的各个部分打开或关闭。</td></tr><tr><td>To use full consciousness would be most distracting in many instances.When I speak, therefore, of primary constructions in the physical field, other fields of course have their own primary constructions also, though they would not be composed of matter in your terms.</td><td>在很多情况下，要利用全部的意识将是最令人分心的。因此，当我说到在物质场域的主建构时，其他场域当然也有它们自己的主建构，尽管它们不是由你们所说的物质组成。</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary physical constructions are those created by a consciousness of its conception of other consciousnesses, from data received through telepathy and other means.</td><td>次要的物质建构是指，由一个意识对其对意识的概念，从通过心灵感应和其他方式接收的资料创造出来的。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your first break.</td><td>我建议你们第一次的休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26. Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed in the same deliberate manner at 9:32.)</td><td>(9:26休息，珍解离如常，她以同样慎重的态度，在)9:32继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Consciousness therefore forms the primary construction about itself, not to protect itself from matter but in order to become allied with matter, the consciousness obviously being diffused through the whole physical construction.</td><td>因此，意识形成关乎自身的主建构，不是为了保护自己不受物质的影响，而是为了与物质结盟，意识显然是通过整体物质的建构来扩散的。</td></tr><tr><td>It hovers about and within the construction.It is not imprisoned by the construction.The apparent imprisoning of consciousness within the primary construction is the result of ignorance, and also an inability that has arisen for various reasons.</td><td>它盘旋在建构的周围和内部。它不被建构所禁锢。意识表面上被禁锢在主建构内，是无知的结果，也是由于各种原因所产生之无能为力的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>As far as using all the powers of consciousness, this is strictly cultural, and has nothing to do with the inherent properties of either consciousness or matter.</td><td>至于使用所有意识的力量，这严格来说是文化上的，与意识或物质的固有属性无关。</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary constructions, being composed of atoms and molecules, contain generalized consciousness and innate capsule comprehension.They do not contain the unifying, integrating, organizing, personal direction of a whole self.</td><td>次建构，同样是由原子与分子组成，也包含广泛性的意识及先天的囊括性理解力。它们不包含整体自己的统一、整合、组织和个人方向。</td></tr><tr><td>They do achieve value fulfillment, however, and within the limits set by their own abilities they also perform the duties of construction.This should be obvious.Here we run into something of which I have sometimes mentioned, concerning afterimages; since in actuality all constructions are simultaneous, realize that I use the term alter for its simplicity to your way of thought.</td><td>不过它们也确实实现了值的充盈，在自身能力设定的范围内，他们也履行了建构的职责。这应该是很明显的。在这里，我们遇到了我提过几次的关于后影像(afterimages)的东西；因为实际上，所有的建构都是同时进行的，要知道，我使用"后"这个字，是因为它的简易性适合你们的思维方式。</td></tr><tr><td>These afterimages could be imagined as rippling outward from any primary construction.Theoretically there would be no end to these.They vary of course in intensity.</td><td>这些后影像可以想像成从任何一个主建构向外扩散的涟漪。理论上，这是没有尽头的。当然它们的强度也各自不同。</td></tr><tr><td>The intertwining of consciousness and matter is most intricate and highly complicated.In all cases consciousness is first, and it forms its physical constructions according to its abilities, first of all forming its own primary construction, and then branching outward, constructing secondary images of other consciousnesses with whom it comes in contact.</td><td>意识与物质的交织是最错综复杂的。在所有的情况下，意识都是在先的，它根据自己的能力形成它的物质建构，首先形成自己的主建构，然后向外分支，建构与之接触的其他意识的次要形象。</td></tr><tr><td>The cooperative aspects of consciousness construction forms the whole fabric of your material universe.A subdivision of primary construction can be called the distortive mirror construction, which would include of course the physical construction of another physical being in birth.</td><td>意识建构的合作方面，构成了你们物质宇宙的整体建构。主建构的一个分支可被称为扭曲的镜像建构，它当然会包括另一个生成的物质存在的物质建构。</td></tr><tr><td>This distortive attempt to recreate the self once more on the physical plane, and to insure self-continuity within that plane, is the basis for the divergence of physical types and characteristics.Such a creation, or recreation, is obviously impossible.</td><td>这种在物质层面再次重新创造自己，并在该层面上确保自身连续性(self-continuity)的这种扭曲尝试(distortiveattempt)，是物质类型和特性分化的基础。这样的创造或再创造，显然是不可能的。</td></tr><tr><td>The distortions are so great that the attempt is foredoomed.It is, nevertheless, attempted, and is a necessary physical adjunct to constructions in your field.I have explained birth, at least briefly.The new human being is obviously not either the father or the mother, and yet is obviously a construction formed by each from physical matter belonging to each.</td><td>扭曲如此之大，以至于尝试是注定失败的。而且是在你们领域中建构的必要物理辅助。我已经解释了出生，至少是简单的解释。这新的人(Thenewhumanbeing)，显然既不是父亲，也不是母亲，但很明显是来自父母各自的实质物质所形成的建构。</td></tr><tr><td>Yet the physical matter of the born infant contains none of the same physical matter which was received initially from the parents.The original matter has completely disappeared, to be replaced by other matter as the consciousness of the infant slowly constructs about itself its growing awareness of itself into physical matter.</td><td>但新生婴儿的这个实质物质，与一开始自父母亲双方接收到的物质，没有一个是相同的。婴儿的意识，它日益增长的对自身的意识，慢慢地把自己构建成了实质物质。</td></tr><tr><td>The parents, therefore, give definite parts of their own physical matter to initiate the infant’s construction, and yet it is not this particular matter which grows.</td><td>因此，父母从自己的身体物质中，提供了确切的部分物质，以开启婴儿的建构，然而成长的，却不是这给出的特定物质。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again, Jane was delivering this material very slowly, with many pauses.)</td><td>(再一次，珍慢慢地传述这些资料，停顿了很多次。)</td></tr><tr><td>Call the particular matter given by the parents x and y.When the child is born, it does not contain anywhere within it these particular portions of matter called x and y.It would appear that the matter had changed.Instead, the matter has vanished, in ways that I have explained earlier.

hence our seed.As the consciousness attains its foothold it projects more effectively.It dispenses with its atoms and molecules, or matter, almost instantaneously, as you know.</td><td>它必须依据自己的能力来这样做。它必须首先取得一个立足点，可以这么说；于是，有了我们的种子。当意识达到它的立足点时，它就会更有效地投射。如你所知，它几乎在瞬间就摒弃了它的原子和分子，或物质。</td></tr><tr><td>The atoms and molecules appear and disappear.Their place is taken by others, so quickly that you do not notice the constant coming and going.</td><td>原子和分子出现又消失。它们的位置被其他原子和分子取代，取代的速度如此之快，以至于你们没有注意到那不断的来来去去。</td></tr><tr><td>The form that consciousness takes in the field of matter is determined by its own strength and capacity.Consciousness forces its way into matter.You should see, then, that though you call a particular portion of grass one blade of grass, the matter that composes it is not static or permanent, and it is not a particular physical object growing, since the matter that composes it is neither static or permanent.</td><td>意识在物质场域采取的形态，是由其自身的力量和能力决定的。意识是强行进入物质的。那么，你们应该明白，虽然你们称草的某个部分为草的叶片，但组成它的物质并不是静态或永久的，它不是一个特定的实物在生长，因为组成它的物质既非静态的，也不是永久的。</td></tr><tr><td>You say that the matter that composes it steadily changes, but this is not the case.The apparent continuity is a result of your inability to perceive the actual atoms that compose matter as they appear and disappear.Because grass appears where seeds have been sown, you have leaped to the conclusion that the matter of the seeds grows from the matter of which they are composed, and that grass grows from the actual matter of the seeds.</td><td>你们说，构成它的物质在稳定地变化，但事实并非如此。表面上的连续性，是由于你们无法感知构成物质的实际原子出现和消失的结果。因为草出现在播种的地方，所以你们就骤然得出结论，种子的物质是从由它们所组成的物质中生长出来的，而草是从种子的实际物质中生长出来的。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, there is absolutely no continuity in the matter that composes the seeds, and the matter that composes the grass.What you have instead is the value fulfillment of the consciousness behind matter, as it expands and expresses itself in various forms.</td><td>同样，组成种子的物质和组成草的物质绝对没有连续性。你们有的，其实是物质背后的意识之值的展现，因为它以各种形态扩张和表达自己。</td></tr><tr><td>Since you can more or less count upon the appearance of grass seed, preceding grass, all this may seem making much over nothing, but it is very important, as you will see later.It is not matter that has continuity, and it is not matter that dictates the form.</td><td>由于你们多少可以料想到草籽出现在草之前，这一切看起来似乎是小题大作，但它非常重要，你们将在后)面看到。有连续性的不是物质，决定形态的也不是物质。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:36.Jane was dissociated as usual.My writing hand felt no fatigue.Jane resumed in the same very deliberate and searching fashion at 10:38.)</td><td>(10:36休息。珍像往常一样解离。我写字的手没有感到疲劳。10:38，珍用同样非常慎重和搜寻的方式继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now that we have gone into the nature of matter as it pertains to grass, you will understand my next analogy more clearly.</td><td>现在我们要进入和草有关的物质本质的话题，你们会更清楚地理解我接下来的比喻。</td></tr><tr><td>Consider a lawn.Obviously this is an arbitrary designation for utility’s sake.Of itself, the matter of grass does not form itself into a lawn.You merely designate certain portions of grass and call it lawn.</td><td>考虑一下草坪。很明显，这是一个为了实用而任意指定的名称。它本身，草的物质本身并没有形成一个草坪。你们只是指定了某些部分的草，并称其为草坪。</td></tr><tr><td>This is the same sort of thing you do when you designate certain portions of matter as blades of grass.Lawns do not come from grass.

"It’s only when strangers are coming that I get really nervous."</td><td>(这是个非常炎热又潮湿的夜晚。到了8:55，派珀医生没有现身，从我的公寓后面的工作室，我可以看到后院的对面，他诊所的灯还亮着。珍在课前只是有点紧张。她说："我们认识的人来参加课程，我一点都不受干扰，""只有陌生人来时，我才会真正紧张。"</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane began dictating on time, and in a quiet and normal voice.Her pacing was at a comfortable rate, her eyes dark as usual.She maintained these attitudes for the whole session, although where indicated she took rather long pauses while delivering the material.)</td><td>(珍准时开始传述，声音轻而正常。她踱步速度适中，眼睛漆黑如往常一样，她整节课都维持这样的状态，不过有几次，在传述当中停顿了很久。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯。")</td></tr><tr><td>I am please that we will now enter into the secondary stage of your education.You can be said to have completed the kindergarten level of achievement and training.</td><td>我很高兴，现在我们将进入你们教育的第二阶段。可以说，你们已经完成了幼儿园水平的成果和培训。</td></tr><tr><td>I say this not to minimize your efforts so far, but only to give you a hint of how much is still to come.We will still be involved for a while in the discussion of matter, and the discussions will be very important from many viewpoints.</td><td>我这么说并不是要贬低你们迄今为止所做的努力，而只是要给你们一个暗示，让你们知道，未来还有很多要学的。我们仍会涉入有关物质的话题一阵子，而这些讨论，从很多角度来看，都是非常重要的。</td></tr><tr><td>Form is not a characteristic of matter, despite appearances.Matter in itself does not possess durability.It is in itself therefore incapable of either growth or deterioration in your terms.</td><td>形态并不是物质的特征，尽管它有外观。物质本身并不具有持久性。因此，用你们的说法，它本身既不能增长，也不能衰败。</td></tr><tr><td>We may as well carry this further right now, in spite of certain dangers of misinterpretation that could, but I hope will not, result.Matter is, as you know, formed.Matter is the result of molecular composition.An object is composed of matter, this is true.Your outer senses then perceive the matter as particular, differentiated, separate objects.</td><td>我们现在不妨就进一步探讨这个问题，尽管可能会有某些误解的风险，但我希望不会。如你们所知，物质是组成的。物质是分子组成的结果。一个物体是由物质组成的，这是确实的。然后，你们的外在感官将物质感知为特定的、有区别的、独立的物体。</td></tr><tr><td>(By now, Jane was speaking at a slower rate, with quite a few rather long pauses between phrases and/or sentences.)</td><td>(现在，珍说话的速度变慢了，在字与句子之间有相当长的停顿。)</td></tr><tr><td>Objects exist, and yet objects in another sense do not exist.I have told you, for example, how you and others construct say, a television set, a chair, an image or a table.Using energy, you manipulate existing atoms and molecules into a certain pattern which you then, and others like you, recognize as one particular object.</td><td>物体是存在的，但在另一种意义上，物体并不存在。例如，我已经告诉过你们，你们和其他人是如何建构比如说一台电视机、一把椅子、一个影象或一张桌子的。运用能量，你将现有的原子和分子操控成某种模式，然后你，以及其他像你一样的人，将其识别为一个特定的物体。</td></tr><tr><td>The object then does, in this sense, exist.The fact is, however, that it exists as a particular object because of your intimate construction of it into a particular pattern, and because of the recognition you give it.</td><td>那么，在这个意义上，这个物体确实存在。但事实是，它作为一个特定的客体存在，是因为你把它私密地建构成一个特定的模式，也因为你给予它的认可。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane walked back and forth in the couple of feet of space between our long narrow coffee table and the divan, gesturing as she talked.)</td><td>(现在，珍在我们狭长的茶几和沙发之间的几英呎空间处来回走动，边说边比划着。)</td></tr><tr><td>The space between this couch and table is as filled with molecular structure as either the space taken up by the couch, or the space taken up by the table.The matter contained within the space taken up by the distance between them, is all the same.You simply have not constructed of the atoms and molecules any pattern which you call an object, and which you recognize.</td><td>这张沙发和桌子之间的空间，与沙发所占的空间，或桌子所占的空间，一样充满了分子结构。在二者之间的距离空间内，所包含的物质都是一样的。你们只是没有把这些原子和分子建构成任何你们称之为物体的模式，而且是你们认可的模式。</td></tr><tr><td>Objects then are really arbitrary designations given to certain arbitrary divisions of atoms and molecules as a whole.There is no objective universe, and yet there is an objective universe.</td><td>那么，物体实际上是对作为一个整体的原子和分子的某些任意划分的武断的称呼。没有客观的宇宙，然而又有一个客观的宇宙。</td></tr><tr><td>This is not hedging the matter, if you will excuse a pun, and the subject will take much further study on your parts.You must act as if there were an objective universe.The world, or field, that you presently inhabit is real, definite on your level.The fact that its reality is only limited to your level, and does not extend to other fields, must not tempt you to discount it; and yet while you must behave in a large manner as if your universe were inherently and basically objective, you must still retain the knowledge that this apparent objectivity has great limits, even practically speaking; and a too-great dependence in a world of objectivity can lead to a psychic imprisonment which is unnecessary.</td><td>请包涵这双关语，这不是在对冲问题，这个议题需要你们做更深一层的思考探究。你们必须像真有一个客观的宇宙一样行事。你们目前所居住的世界或场域，在你们的层次上是确切且真实的。它的实相只限于在你们的层次，而不延伸到其他场域，但绝不能因这一事实而倾向于不认真行事；然而，虽然你们必须在很大程度上，表现得好像你们的宇宙是天生且基本上是客观的，但你们仍然必须保留这样的认识，明白这种表面上的客观有很大的局限性，甚至从实际情况来看也是如此；对客观世界的过度依赖，可能导致一种灵性上禁锢，而这大可不必。</td></tr><tr><td>In a distant future, even in your field, the limits of the so-called objective world will clearly be known and demonstrated, and a great freedom for mankind will result.</td><td>在遥远的未来，即使是在你们的场域，所谓客观世界的局限性，也会被清楚地认识和证明，人类将因此获得极大的自由。</td></tr><tr><td>Study and practice with psychological time will show you the validity and strength of that inner self, so that you will clearly see that it is not completely bound to the so-called objective universe by any means.Matter is not an imprisoning form. It is a means by which consciousness expresses itself within the limits of the physical field.</td><td>心理时间的学习和实践，会为你们展示内在自己的有效性和力量，让你们清楚地看到，它无论如何都不会)完全被所谓的客观宇宙所束缚。物质并不是一个禁锢的形态，它是意识在物质场域的限制范围内表达自己的一种方式。</td></tr><tr><td>I now suggest your first break.</td><td>我现在建议你们第一次的休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27. Jane was dissociated as usual.It might be interesting to note that while Jane was delivering this material, she strolled about the room without a sign of discomfort on this very hot and stuffy, humid night.Her skin was dry and fresh looking.On the other hand, sitting with my clothes stuck to my body, I had to place a cardboard under my right hand in order to avoid soaking my notepaper.</td><td>(9:27休息，珍解离如常。值得注意的是：当珍在传送这份资料时，在这闷热潮湿的夜晚，她在房间里走来走去，没有任何一点不舒服的迹象。她的皮肤看起来很干爽。相对的，我坐在这里，汗湿的衣服贴在身上，我不得不拿一块纸板垫在右手下，以免汗水浸湿了我的笔记本。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same quiet manner, with some rather long pauses, at 9:35.)</td><td>(9:35，珍以同样平静的方式继续传述，并有一些相当长的停顿。)</td></tr><tr><td>Objects therefore, are arbitrary designations, divisions that you set up.You perceive portions of the endless sea of molecular constructions.You form portions into separate objects that are actually no more separate or different from the whole sea than is one burst of sea spray from another.That is, one burst of sea spray, while separate for a moment, is like all other sea spray in its basic components and construction.</td><td>因此，物体是任意指定的，是你们设定的区分。你们感知到分子建构的无尽之海的某一部分。你们把这些部分组成独立的物体，这些物体实际上与整个分子建构的无尽之海没有什么区别，就好像激起的浪花与另一朵浪花一样，并未与大海分离或不同。也就是说，激起的浪花虽然暂时与大海分开，但在其基本成分和建构上，仍是与所有其它的浪花一样。</td></tr><tr><td>It can be shown, and we will go into this, that form is not a characteristic of matter.You will have to look elsewhere for durability and form.Your cause and effect theory, again, is responsible here for many distortions, such as the idea that the matter of say, a flower, grows from matter of a seed directly.Such is not the case.</td><td>可以证实，而且我们也会探讨，形态不是物质的特征。你们必须在别的地方去找持久性和形态。再一次，你们的因果理论，在这里要为很多的扭曲负责，比如说，一朵花的物质是直接从种子的物质中生长出来的观念。事实并非如此。</td></tr><tr><td>Matter in your field is undifferentiated by nature, so to speak, and it is the complicated human abilities that give it form and meaning.I have mentioned that expectation has much to do with individual constructions, and indeed this cannot be stressed too strongly.</td><td>在你们的场域里，物质在本质上可以说是无差别的，是人类复杂的能力，赋予了它形态和意义。我提到过，期待与个人建构有很大的关联，这一点再怎么强调都不为过。</td></tr><tr><td>The mechanisms involved in the actual construction of matter are all intertwined and closely connected.You give constructions their appearance of continuity by continually creating them in line with your expectations, based upon among other things, previous constructions in the apparent past; and these expectations are the result of psychic communication between yourselves and others, particularly from parents, who give the child his first conceptions of the environment which, indeed, his parents have created.</td><td>在物质的实际建构中，所涉及的机制都是相互交织、紧密相连的。你们通过不断创造符合你们期待的结构，使其具有连续性的外观，除其他事项外，还基于过去明显的建构；而这些期待，是你们自己和别人之间灵性交流的结果，特别是来自父母，他们给孩子提供了对于环境的最初概念，而这的确是他的父母创造的。</td></tr><tr><td>In all cases constructions will follow the line of expectation, and often a vicious circle is initiated, where the environment created by an individual will then reinforce the very distortive conceptions that caused it to begin with.</td><td>在所有的情况下，建构都会遵循期待的路线，这往往会引发一个恶性循环，由个人创造的环境，随后将强)化那非常扭曲的概念，而正是这扭曲的概念，导致了恶性循环的开始。</td></tr><tr><td>On a practical level, later, we will go into steps that can be taken to offset such an unfortunate liability.Indeed, you have both yourselves begun to operate much more efficiently in these important areas of expectation and construction.</td><td>在实践层次上，稍后，我们将讨论可以采取的步骤，以抵消这种不幸的责任。事实上，你们自己在期待和建构的重要领域上，已经开始更有效地运作。</td></tr><tr><td>Recognition of many of the facts that we are discussing this evening will be of benefit in your psychological time experiences.</td><td>认识到我们今晚所讨论的许多事实，对你们的心理时间实验将是有益的。</td></tr><tr><td>Since you construct objects, you can therefore construct them more to your convenience when you realize that matter can thusly be manipulated.There are of course different methods of construction suitable for various fields, and in some instances the same atoms and molecules can be utilized by inhabitants of more than one field.</td><td>由于你们建构了客体，因此，当你们意识到物质可以这样被操纵时，你们更可以按自己的方便去建构它们。当然，有适合不同场域的不同建构方法，在某些情况下，相同的原子和分子可以被多个场域的居民利用。</td></tr><tr><td>In this case of course the inhabitants of the different fields remain unaware of each other, and only see, or recognize, the particular pattern that they have imposed upon the atoms and molecules in question.</td><td>在这种情况下，当然，不同场域的居民仍然不知道彼此的存在，他们只看到或认识到自己强加给有关原子和分子的特定模式。</td></tr><tr><td>This is not contradictory. I suggest your break.</td><td>这并不矛盾，我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:58.Jane was dissociated as usual.And again, she was unbothered by the heavy heat while delivering the material.My writing hand was by now somewhat tired, though I hadn’t been overworked this evening by any means.</td><td>(9:58休息。珍解离如常。再次地，她在传送资料期间，并没有被酷热所干扰。我写字的手此时已经有些疲惫，虽然今晚并没有工作过度。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same quiet and deliberate manner at 10:06.)</td><td>(10:06，珍以同样安静和慎重的方式恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>Matter, atoms and molecules, represent but one aspect and one single dimension of a far greater reality.You can manipulate only the portion of this reality which you can perceive.</td><td>物质、原子和分子，只代表了一个更大实相的一个面向和单一的维度。你们只能操纵这个实相中你们能感知到的部分。</td></tr><tr><td>Therefore your manipulations are extremely superficial, as far as their effect on the larger reality is concerned.This is the first time, I believe, that this particular subject has come into our discussions.Yet our fifth-dimensional early session hinted in this direction.</td><td>因此，就其对更大实相的影响而言，你们的操纵是极其粗浅而表面的。我相信这是我们第一次讨论这个特定的主题。但是在我们早期课程中提过的第五维度，暗示了这一方向。</td></tr><tr><td>(Although Seth has given us relatively little on the fifth dimension, he has made many references to this one session.See the 12th session, of January 2, 1964, page 60.Notice also that this material was obtained 60 sessions ago; and as far as my memory serves, Seth has not contradicted himself on this fifth dimensional material in any sessions that have taken place since then.)</td><td>(虽然赛斯给我们关于第五维度的资料相对较少，但他多次提到这一课程。见1964年1月2日第12节。请注意，这份资料是60节之前得到的；就我记忆所及，赛斯在此后的任何一次课程中，都没有在这个第五维度的资料上自相矛盾过。)</td></tr><tr><td>You are playing with the very outmost skin of a reality whose true thickness and depth is presently beyond your comprehension.I am using the terms depth and thickness to aid you.They are meant for their intuitional value, and not to be necessarily taken literally.</td><td>你们是在与实相的最表层游戏，而这个实相的真正厚度和深度是你们目前无法理解的。我使用深度和厚度这两个词只是来帮助你们理解。它们指的是直觉上的值，而不必然是字面上的意思。</td></tr><tr><td>Nor is this material itself in any way meant to suggest that the attempt for knowledge is futile.By no means.Only that your own conceptions must first enlarge and not be imprisoned by the limitations.</td><td>这份资料本身也不意味着对求知的尝试是徒劳的。绝非如此。只是你们自己的概念首先必须扩大，而不能被局限性所禁锢。</td></tr><tr><td>Value fulfillment represents an extension of the inner self in its journey into this reality.The reality can be manipulated only after its existence is known.</td><td>内在自己进入这个实相的历程中，值的充盈代表着内在自己的延伸。只有知道实相的存在后，才能操纵实相。</td></tr><tr><td>We are not going to have a long session this evening.I am certainly not giving you any summer vacation.Nevertheless I do go easy on you now and then, merely because I like to vary the intensities of our sessions, as this is a most effective teaching method, and various portions of subject matter cause different energy expenditures.</td><td>今晚的课不会太长。我当然不会给你们任何暑假。不过我偶尔也会对你们放松一下，只是因为我喜欢改变我们课程的强度，因为这是最有效的教学方法，而且主题的各个部份导致不同的能量消耗。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane had, again, been taking some rather long pauses as she delivered this material)</td><td>(珍在传递这段资料时，又有相当长的停顿。)</td></tr><tr><td>I always like to have much energy on your part as reserve.It is true that in almost all cases our winter sessions will be most intensive, for various reasons.The matter of this reality, of which you know so little, will be the basis for future discussions, and indeed your inner senses will aid you in the perception of some of its facets.</td><td>我总是喜欢你们有很多能量作为储备。的确，由于各种原因，几乎在所有的情况下，我们的冬季课程将是最密集的。你们所知甚少的实相问题，将会成为未来讨论的基础，事实上，你们的内在感官将协助你们感知它的某些面。</td></tr><tr><td>Energy constantly changes.Form is not a characteristic of energy, any more than it is a characteristic of matter.As a rule no form imposed upon energy can long endure.The form cannot long endure.The consciousness behind the form, that imposes the form, does endure; because while energy continually changes and does not retain imposed form, it is in itself conscious, and its consciousness endures.</td><td>能量不断变化。形态不是能量的特征，就像它不是物质的特征一样。照例，没有一个强加于能量上的形态能长期存在。形态无法长存。形态背后的，那个强加形态的意识，确实是持久的；因为虽然能量不断变化，并且不保留强加的形态，但它本身是有意识的，它的意识是持久的。</td></tr><tr><td>I have explained that even consciousness does not always use its full potentiality, in the light analogy of the other evening.The entity represents that part of consciousness which is aware of the other compartments of itself.</td><td>在另一个晚上用光来做的比喻中，我已经解释过，即使是意识，也并不总是使用其全部的潜能。存有代表着知悉自身其他单独部分的那份意识。</td></tr><tr><td>This is enough on this, this evening.We have gone quite far into some new material, and I wish you a most fond good evening.</td><td>今晚有这些就够了。我们已经深入了不少新的资料，我祝你们有一个最美好的夜晚。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 10:25.Jane was dissociated as usual. She said she could feel Seth abruptly leave when he reached the end of the session."He’s gone, "she said.She is of the opinion that Seth likes to deliver his material in batches, whether they be long or short.</td><td>(10:25结束。珍像往常一样解离，她说她能感觉到，当赛斯到了课程结束时，突然离去。"他走了。"她说。她认为，赛斯喜欢分批地传递他的资料，不管是长还是短。</td></tr><tr><td>(My writing hand felt no fatigue now.Nor did we get to ask about the Hubbell Roberts material included at the beginning of this session.Jane said Seth chose not to bother with it tonight.)</td><td>(我写字的手现在并不觉得累。我们也没有机会问到收录在这节课开始前的，有关哈贝尔·罗伯茨的资料。珍说，赛斯今晚选择了不去理会它。)</td></tr><tr><td>(Trying psychological time, I had the following experiences:</td><td>(在做心理时间练习时，我有以下经历：</td></tr><tr><td>(Tues. 7/21, 8:30 PM: No results.</td><td>(7月21日，星期二，晚上8:30：一无所获。</td></tr><tr><td>(Wed. 7/22, 8:00 PM: I experienced a generalized feeling of enlargement once again in my hands.

She was quite surprised, and has never had the experience before, although it has been some months since either of us watched others working the board— indeed, since the Seth material began to flow.Perhaps Jane's abilities have improved in that field also.</td><td>(当到了派珀夫妇向显灵板提出第三个问题时，那个问题是关于沟通者的名字，珍已经在精神上接收到，弗雷德·雷克(FredLake)，这个名字。她没有告诉派珀夫妇，但当指针移动到字母F时，她脑海中已经有了这个全名。她相当惊讶，以前从未有过这样的经验，虽然我们好几个月没有看别人操作显灵板了——真的，自从赛斯资料开始流过来之后。也许珍在这方面的能力也提高了。</td></tr><tr><td>(The next question the Pipers asked for was a date from Fred Lake.Jane received an answer for this question too, and noted it down on her own.The pointer however, hesitated over several numbers in giving the Pipers an answer, so the results here are inconclusive.</td><td>(派珀夫妇问弗雷德·雷克的下一个问题，是一个日期。珍同样收到了这个问题的答案，并且自己记了下来。但是，指针在给派珀的答案中，对几个数字犹豫不决，所以这里的结果是不确定的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Being tired from the session, Jane did not pursue the thing any further, and we let the Pipers alone while they received several more answers.But Jane and I plan to repeat this experiment with other couples, while we observe and see if either of us can pick up, in some fashion, answers the pointer will give.)</td><td>(上了一节课，累了，珍没有再追问下去，我们让派珀夫妇自己继续。而他们又得到了几个答案。但珍和我打算和其他夫妇重复这个实验，同时观察并看看，我们中的任何一人能否以某种方式收到指针会给出的答案。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 73</td><td>第73节物质本质,派珀夫妇,实相的深度(用画作比喻)</td></tr><tr><td>JULY 22, 1964 9 PM WEDNESDAY AS SCHEDULED</td><td>1964年7月22日星期三晚上9点定期课</td></tr><tr><td>(This morning Jane invited Dr. and Mary Piper to witness the session tonight.The doctor and his wife accepted the invitation, contingent upon whether his office was still busy at session time, and whether they could get a baby sitter.</td><td>(今天早上，珍邀请派珀医生和玛丽·派珀(MaryPiper)来见证今晚的课。医生和他的妻子接受了邀)请，不过这得看到了晚上上课时，他的诊所还忙不忙，以及他们是否能找到一个临时的保姆。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again, it was a very hot and humid evening.A light rain was falling by 8:55 PM, and the Pipers had not appeared.Although Jane did not seem nervous, I knew she was nervous to some degree because of the prospect of new witnesses.</td><td>(又是个非常炎热潮湿的夜晚。到了8:55，开始飘起了小雨，派珀夫妇没有出现。虽然珍看起来并不紧张，但我知道，因为可能会有新的见证人，她还是有一点紧张的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Willy dozed in his favorite chair.Jane began dictating in an altogether normal voice, pacing leisurely, her eyes dark as usual.)</td><td>(威利在牠最喜欢的椅子上打盹。珍以完全正常的声音开始传述，步履悠闲，她的眼睛像往常一样黑。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am going to give you some more material concerning our discussion of matter, but first I would like to make one comment.</td><td>关于物质的讨论，我打算再给你们一些资料，但首先我想做一个评论。</td></tr><tr><td>After eight o’clock on the night of a session, Ruburt should take steps so that he is not concerned over the question of whether or not particular visitors will arrive.I cannot get through to him as well when he is so concerned; nor, when he is so concerned, can I let him know ahead of time whether or not witnesses will arrive.</td><td>在上课的当晚8点之后，鲁柏应该采取步骤，使他不为特定的来访者是否会到来的问题而挂心。当他太关心时，我无法透过来；当他如此关心时，我也无法让他提前知道证人是否会来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Before the session, Jane had remarked that she wished Seth could, or would, let her know whether witnesses were coming.If she is able to let Seth so inform her in advance, it would be very convenient, to say the least.)</td><td>(上课之前，珍曾说，她希望赛斯可以让她知道证人是否会来。如果她能让赛斯提前通知她，至少可以说，会很方便。)</td></tr><tr><td>The whole thing should be handled on a subconscious level, so that he seems to automatically prepare himself in advance in response to an inner knowledge as to whether or not witnesses will arrive.That is, I can let him know; but overly conscious preoccupation blocks him from knowing.</td><td>整个事情应该在潜意识的层次上进行处理，这样他似乎就会根据内心对证人是否会到来的认识，自动提前做好准备。也就是说，我可以让他知道；但过于关注在那件事上，反而阻挡了他的知情。</td></tr><tr><td>(From my seat at the living room table next to the windows, I happened to look out in time to see the Pipers turn the corner and move down the street toward our house.I pointed toward the window, and Jane caught my meaning)</td><td>(从我坐的位置，靠窗的桌前，我碰巧擡头看到了对面派珀夫妇转过街角，向我们的房子走来。我向窗口指了指，珍会意了我的意思。)</td></tr><tr><td>Close friends obviously no longer bother him.It is only strangers, or those with whom you are not closely familiar.</td><td>亲近的朋友显然不再困扰他。只有陌生人，或那些还不是很熟识的人，才会对他造成困扰。</td></tr><tr><td>Now that your guests are indeed arriving, you may let them enter, or I myself will open the door.I suggest that this time you open the door, and bid that they be seated.</td><td>现在你们的客人的确要到了，你可以让他们进来，或者我自己开门。我建议，这一次你来开门，并招呼他们坐下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused by the windows, looking down the rather large room to the door.I lay my board aside. As I did the door opened and the Pipers entered quietly.Neither of them had attended a session before, but Jane had made arrangements that they were to enter without knocking if they arrived after 9 PM.</td><td>(珍在窗前停了下来，看着这个相当大的房间，向门口望去。当我把写字板放在一边时，门开了，派拍夫妇安静地走进来。他们俩之前都没有参加过课程，但珍告诉过他们，如果九点以后他们才到，就不用敲门，直接进来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane remained standing mutely by the windows while I showed the guests to seats.I gave them copies of the last few sessions, to familiarize them with the material in case they would rather read than listen at first.</td><td>(当我请客人就座时，珍一言不发地站在窗边。我给了他们最后几节课的副本，如果他们一开始想先用读的方式熟悉这些资料，而非用听的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane then resumed; but now her voice was much stronger and somewhat deeper, quite different from the easygoing tone and volume she had used to open the session.)</td><td>(珍接着继续传述；不过现在，她的声音更强，更低沉有力，和这节一开始时，那种安逸的语调和音量截然不同。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have never been much of a host.I hope, however, that you have explained your name and the circumstances surrounding it.</td><td>我向来不怎么会做主人。不过，我希望你已经交代了你的名字和相关情况。</td></tr><tr><td>We will now continue with a discussion that we have begun concerning the nature of matter, and bringing up in particular one point I wish to make clear.</td><td>现在我们将继续进行，我们已经开始的，关于物质本质的讨论，并特别提出我希望明确阐明的一点。</td></tr><tr><td>As I have told you, form is not a characteristic of matter.I have said, for example, that grass does not grow from seed.You observe that grass often appears where seed has been sown, and you conclude erroneously that the seed grows from matter within it, and that grass grows from the seed.</td><td>我告诉过你们，形态不是物质的一个特征。例如，我已经说过，草不是从种子长出来的。你们观察到，草通常出现在播种的地方，你们就错误地得出结论，种子从它内部的物质中生长出来，而草从种子中生长出来。</td></tr><tr><td>The atoms and molecules, energy in matter, appear and disappear instantaneously.Energy constantly is constructed into the guise of matter, but matter is the simultaneous expression of energy under certain conditions.</td><td>原子与分子，物质中的能量，瞬间出现，瞬间消逝。能量不断地被构建成物质的伪装外衣，但物质是能量在一定条件下的同时表现。</td></tr><tr><td>(By now, Jane's delivery was much more vigorous, her voice quite loud and strong.Now she walked over to a cane chair that was unoccupied.)</td><td>(现在，珍的传讯更加强而有力，声音很洪亮。现在她走到一张空着的藤椅旁边。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will again use this chair, this time to explain our point.The chair is being constantly constructed.Now the chair represents a subdivision in matter, being what you term dead matter, though we know that consciousness is everywhere.</td><td>我们再次用这把椅子，这一次是来解释我们的论点。椅子是一直不断地被建构的。现在，这张椅子代表了物质)中的一个分支，是你们所称为的死物质，但我们知道，意识无处不在。</td></tr><tr><td>The chair is being fully constructed simultaneously and instantaneously.Now take the blade of grass, and the seed.Energy and the consciousness within continually constructs itself into completely new constructions; because of the various speeds I have spoken of, and because you do not perceive the full reality, you do not notice the simultaneous constructions, and think them continuous, rather than separate and ever new.</td><td>椅子是同时、瞬间被完整地构建出来的。现在拿叶片和种子来说。在它之内的能量和意识，不断地把自己建构成全新的结构；由于我说过的各种速度，也由于你们没有感知到完整的实相，你们没有注意到那同时的建构，认为它们是连续的，而不是分开且一直更新的。</td></tr><tr><td>When energy in its performance brings about a complete change of form, as it does when a seed seems to grow into a blade of grass, what you have here is merely such a complete difference between the gradations which you are able to perceive, that finally you are forced to admit that the thing you take to be continuous matter has somehow or other become something entirely different.</td><td>当能量在其表现中带来形态的完全改变时，就像一粒种子似乎长成一片叶子一样，你在这里所看到的，只是你能够感知到的渐层变化中那截然的不同，所以你最后不得不承认，你认为是连续性物质的东西，已经不知何故，成为了完全不同的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>You know that you cannot perceive with the outer senses the pulsations of energy as they form this chair; because you cannot perceive these pulsations, the chair appears durable, a part of your time and space, and continuous in time and space.</td><td>你知道，当能量形成这张椅子时，你无法用外在感官感知能量的脉动；因为你无法感知这些脉动，所以这张椅子看起来是持久的，是你们时间与空间的一部分，而且在时间与空间中是连续的。</td></tr><tr><td>The chair is neither durable nor continuous, and its reality is limited to the recognition which you give it as an object.</td><td>椅子既不持久，也不连续，它的实相仅限于你对它作为一个物体的认可。</td></tr><tr><td>Before we have our first break, I will now welcome our guests, although I regret that so much of the material will not be clear, since so much of it rests upon previous discussions with which they are not familiar.</td><td>现在，在我们第一次休息之前，我要欢迎我们的客人，尽管我很遗憾，有很多资料将会不清楚，因为其中有很多是基于他们不熟悉的先前所讨论的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>The woman's entity name is Aeiada, Ae-ia-da, and the man’s is Norman.I suggest your first break, and again may I say that I enjoy your rainy evening.I have been preparing your house for you.Please take your break.、</td><td>这位女士的存有名字叫艾达A-e-i-a-d-e，而这位男士的存有的名字叫诺曼。我建议你们第一次的休息，让我再说一次，我喜欢你们的雨夜。我一直在为你们筹备你们的房子。请休息一下吧。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:23.Jane was dissociated as usual.Seth has yet to explain what he means by "preparing" our new house for us.During break we tried to give the Pipers a brief resume of what the Seth material involves.Jane resumed in the same vigorous and strong-voiced manner at 9:32.)</td><td>(9:23休息。珍解离如常。赛斯还没有解释他所谓的帮我们"筹备"新宅是什么意思。休息期间，我们试图给派珀夫妇一些简短的摘要，说明赛斯资料所涉及的内容。珍在9:32以同样铿锵有力的方式继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have not known either of your guests before, but then I do not have to.</td><td>我以前不认识你这两位客人，但我也不需要认识。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not the nervous one.It is Ruburt who constantly, and oftentimes bullheadedly, blocks what I have to say.</td><td>紧张的那个人并不是我。鲁柏才是那个常常顽固地把我要说的话挡掉的人。</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless, Norman has twice before been a man, and the time immediately preceding this existence he was a woman.There were two children then, and he is in this life closely acquainted with three individuals who were close to him in the past existence.</td><td>不过，诺曼曾经两世是男人，而在这一世之前，他是女人。那时他有两个孩子，在这一世，有三位熟人在过去世中与他的关系密切。</td></tr><tr><td>("Can you tell us something about them?"</td><td>("你能告诉我们一些关于他们的事吗？"</td></tr><tr><td>(I thought this a good question, since we knew nothing of the Piper's personal history.I interrupted Jane’s delivery somewhat to ask it, and it will be noted that Seth did not answer it.As the session wore on I neglected to repeat it.I have the feeling that the question did not really penetrate enough to make itself felt.)</td><td>(我认为这是一个很好的问题，因为我们对派珀这个人的过往一无所知。我多少打断了珍的传讯来问这个问题，可以注意到，赛斯没有回答这个问题。随着课程进行，我忘了再问一次。我觉得这个问题并没有真的深入到让它被感觉到的程度。)</td></tr><tr><td>He once, and not purposely, broke a mans back in an accident involving horses. There was no deep guilt involved.Nevertheless in the woman's existence he passed by a feeling of guilt.This time he mends peoples backs, but this is not the only connection.</td><td>他曾经，不是故意的，在一次涉及马匹的意外中，撞断了一个男人的背，其中并未涉及什么深刻的内疚感。但是在他身为女人的那一世，他却带着罪恶感而活。这一世，他治疗人们的背部，但这不是唯一的关联。</td></tr><tr><td>He was an alchemist.He has been in past existences concerned with matters that lie beneath matter, if you will excuse a pun; and for this reason the interest has grown.One life was in a country close to what you now call Palestine, I believe approximately 832 A.D., and in this life the accident occurred.</td><td>他曾是一位炼金术士。他在过去的存在中，一直关注着隐藏在物质之下的事情，如果你能原谅这个双关语；由于这个原因，他在这方面的兴趣越来越大。他有一世是)生活在靠近你们现在称为巴勒斯坦的一个国家，我相信时间大约是在公元832年，意外就是发生在那一世。</td></tr><tr><td>Germany also, 1732, in what is now Cologne; an alchemist.1872, a very brief life as a woman, dying at age 33 in childbirth.Sweden.</td><td>还有在1732年的德国，现在的科隆；他是一个炼金术士。1872年，作为一个女人，生命非常短暂，33岁死于难产。瑞典。</td></tr><tr><td>There has been a need for discipline, which is now somewhat being achieved, and past interests which have this time solidified into a more coherent purpose.We will at another time go more further into these particular matters.</td><td>一直以来，他都需要有纪律，这一点现在已经在某种程度上达到了，过去的兴趣，在这一世凝聚成了一个更加一致的目的。我们将在别的时间进一步探讨这些具体事情。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, we find that the woman has been twice a male.This has given an open mindedness that is this time combined with a more feminine intuition.The nearest I can come now is that one life was concerned with the occupation of a boats man, of rather small craft, skirting near the shores of the Mediterranean.</td><td>再来，我们发现这女人有两世是男性。这赋予了她开明的思想，而这一次则与更多的女性直觉相结合。我现在能得出的最近的一世与担任船员有关，那艘船很小，沿着地中海岸航行。</td></tr><tr><td>The craft carried merchandise but not spices, rather perhaps cotton.There was also a soldier’s rather superstitious existence, in an involvement during the Crusade period, where if I may say so, men were driven like fools, and sometimes brainless idiots, in fine pursuit of an idea of God which they could neither conceive or construct.</td><td>那艘船运载商品，但不是香料，而可能是棉花。还有一世是个很迷信的士兵，在十字军东征期间卷入其中。恕我直言，那个时期，人们像傻瓜一样被驱策着，有时又像个无脑的白痴，为了追求一种他们既无法想像也无法构建的上帝的理念。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane pointed at Bob Piper.By now her voice was quieting down.)</td><td>(珍指着鲍勃·派珀。现在她的声音轻了一些。)</td></tr><tr><td>He was indeed at that time as superstitious as the rest.In a battle, he was killed by a Moor.The looting carried on in the name of the Christian God would indeed make the pagans blush.</td><td>当时，他确实和其他人一样迷信。在一场战役中，他被一个摩尔人杀死。以基督教上帝的名义进行的劫掠，真的连异教徒的脸都红了。</td></tr><tr><td>There is still a tendency here to depend perhaps overmuch on intuitions which are basically sound; but such a dependence must go hand in hand with the discipline of which I have spoken.The death occurred in desert.It happened very close to Lepanto.He was then in his late fifties, and left two women.Not one.Also one son and four daughters.</td><td>这里仍有一种倾向，即也许过分依赖基本上是可靠的直觉；但这种依赖必须与我所说的纪律携手并进。死亡发生在沙漠。它发生在离勒庞托(Lepanto)非常近的地方。当时他已经将近六十岁了，留下了两个女人。不是一个。还有一个儿子和四个女儿。</td></tr><tr><td>There is much more along these lines.I believe he sent a message to one woman by a young man, and the message was not delivered.This will not mean much to his present personality on a conscious level, but the fact that the message was not delivered will mean much to the inner self, for that previous personality had set store by it.</td><td>这方面还有很多可以说的。我相信他通过一个年轻人给一名女子送了一条信息，而信息没有送达。这对他这一世的人格来说，在意识层面上没有多大的意义，但信息没被送达的事实，对内在自己来说会有很大的意义，因为那一世的人格对这件事非常在意。</td></tr><tr><td>I will suggest a short break.And incidentally, I have not forgotten the party, of which I have said already too much.I feel that after so many dry and studious sessions I owe you a night to remember, but I shall keep my dignity, and you may worry about your own.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。顺带一提，我并没有忘记那个派对，对此我已经说得太多了。我觉得在这么多枯燥的学)习课程之后，我欠你们一个值得回忆的夜晚，但我还是会维持我的尊严，而你就担心你们自己的吧。</td></tr><tr><td>Take your break, by all means.</td><td>好好休息一下吧。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:56.Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed in her quieter voice at 10:06.)</td><td>(9:56休息。珍解离如常。10:06，她以较轻细的声音恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>There was no communication between the four of you in the past, and no linkage of your lives.There has been however, a telepathic sort of communication between you in the present, and it is no coincidence that you became acquainted.On a subconscious level you realized that many of your interests were the same.</td><td>过去你们四个人之间没有交流，在生活中也没有联系。不过在这一世，你们有一种心灵感应式的交流，你们的相识并非巧合。在潜意识层次上，你们意识到，你们的许多兴趣是相同的。</td></tr><tr><td>The child of the man and the woman has existed as a personality four times before, which makes him older than his parents, in a manner of speaking.He died as a young child upon one occasion, a girl with musical abilities.During another existence in, I believe Babylonia, he was what passed for a scribe.</td><td>这位男士和女士的孩子，过去曾有四次做为一个人格存在，可以这么说，这使他比他的父母还要老。有一次，他死的时候还是个孩子，是一个有音乐才能的女孩。在另一个存在期间，我相信是在巴比伦，他是一个抄写员。</td></tr><tr><td>He worked on tablets of stone, and was given social position because of this ability, though he did not come from well-to-do parents.</td><td>他将经文刻在石板上，并因为这个能力而被赋予了社会地位，虽然他不是来自富裕家庭。</td></tr><tr><td>("What is the child’s entity name?")</td><td>("这个孩子的存有名字是什么？")</td></tr><tr><td>His entity name is Waldoon.The musical ability was picked up again in the 16th century in England, where we find him as a minor composer for organ, where he used the scribe’s ability as well.</td><td>他的存有名字是沃尔顿(Waldoon)。音乐才能在16世纪的英国再次被拾起，在那里我们发现他是一个风琴的小作曲家，在那里他也使用了文书的能力。</td></tr><tr><td>There is a mechanical talent, early developed, though strangely in a woman’s life, when he was a girl caring for a father's shop.The shop was concerned with the forerunner, or a forerunner, of balloons, an early invention that never became popular, for the distribution of letters in medieval France.</td><td>还有一种机械方面的天赋，很早就被开发出来了，虽然这在一个女人的生命中很不寻常，当他还是一个在帮父亲看店的女孩时。那家商店涉及的是与轻气球有关的前身，或者说是一个先驱，在中世纪的法国，气球是一项从未普及的早期发明，用于分发信件。</td></tr><tr><td>I will now, with your kind permission, say a few words in reference to the reality of which I spoke briefly last session.</td><td>现在，如果你们没有意见，我要提几句上一节略微讨论到的实相。</td></tr><tr><td>You can come close to understanding this reality if you will once more consider an analogy that we made much earlier.Do you remember our imaginary painting that hung upon the wall?</td><td>如果你们再仔细想想我们更早之前做的一个比喻，就会对这个实相有更深一层的理解。你还记得我们挂在墙上的假想画吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes."</td><td>("记得"。</td></tr><tr><td>(See the 43rd session, page 4.Jane now pointed to a painting I had finished a couple of years ago; it hung over our divan, above the couch.I had used Jane as a model, and in the painting she stood by a river, beneath trees; across the river could be glimpsed a village.)</td><td>(见第43节课。现在，珍指着我几年前完成的一幅)画；它挂在我们长沙发上方的墙上。我以珍作为模特，在画中，她站在一条河边的树下；河对面可以瞥见一个)村庄。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will take that painting for an example.In our analogy, the painting while framed within a given space, expanded.It did not spill out into the room and yet the trees can be imagined to grow taller, the background to add in distance and perspective, the water to flow; and yet there would be no impression made on the back of the painting.</td><td>我们将以那幅画为例。在我们的比喻中，这幅画虽然被框在一个既定的空间内，但却扩展了。它没有溢出到房间里，但可以想像树木长高了，画的背景增加了距离和视角，水流动了；但在画的背面不会有任何印象。</td></tr><tr><td>Examination of the back of the painting would show nothing.The elements of the painting would expand in the same way that I have told you the universe expands, in a way that has nothing to do with space but of value fulfillment, which has its own kind of depth and perspective, and which exists not only behind but within the construction of matter.</td><td>检查画的背面不会显示任何东西。这幅画的元素会以我曾告诉你们的宇宙扩展的方式扩展，以一种与空间无关但与值的充盈有关的方式，它有自己的深度和视角，不仅仅存在于物质建构的背后，而且也存在于物质建构之内。</td></tr><tr><td>The depth of this reality cannot be plunged into in the same manner that one plunges into a river or a stream.The depth of this reality can, again, be compared to the depth of a sleep or a trance, or the depth of any common psychological experience.</td><td>这个实相的深度不能像人们跳入河川或溪流那样地跃入其中。这个实相的深度，再次地，可以与睡眠或出神的深度，或任何一般的心灵体验的深度相比拟。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt I believe once wrote a poem in which he stated, much more poetically indeed, that pain was deeper than a lake or a river; and this type of depth is that to which I refer here.There are perspectives of which you know relatively little, and they in turn are frameworks, forming physical constructions, actual physical constructions, which you do not perceive.</td><td>我相信鲁柏曾经写过一首诗，诗里说的，那的确更有诗意：痛楚比一片湖泊或河流更深；我在这里所指的就是这种类型的深度。有一些你们知之甚少的视角，而它们)又是那框架，组成物质结构，真实的物质建构，而你们并没有感知到。</td></tr><tr><td>There are multitudinous physical constructions in the space between these two chairs, of which you are not aware, because you cannot perceive the perspective in which they occur.</td><td>在这两把椅子之间的空间里，有无数的物质建构，你们没有意识到，因为你无法感知到它们发生的视角。</td></tr><tr><td>I am going to suggest your break.I would first of all suggest, and only suggest, that the four of you continue an association, as I believe you will all benefit.There are abilities on your visitor's parts which are not being utilized, and which certainly should be.</td><td>我将建议你们休息。我首先建议，也只是建议，你们四个人继续交往，因为我相信你们都会受益。你们的客人有ㄧ些尚未使用到的能力，而这些能力当然应该要善加利用。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:28.Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed in the same manner, somewhat more strong and forceful than usual, at 10:35.)</td><td>(10:28休息。珍解离如常。10:35她以比平时较为有力的方式继续传述，)</td></tr><tr><td>I certainly do appreciate, and indeed do enjoy, your lively discussions.And I do indeed recall Ruburt’s rather daring, but more nearly stupid, blunderings into his first deep trance.</td><td>我当然欣赏，而且确实喜欢你们的热烈讨论。我确实记得鲁伯那相当大胆，但更多的是愚蠢，第一次陷入深度出神时的莽撞。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's Jan. 10/64 trance is described in Session 14, Vol. 1.)</td><td>(这里指的是，珍1964年1月10日的出神状态，整个)事件记录在第14节课。)</td></tr><tr><td>I would suggest that your visitors be allowed to borrow a copy of the material, as they are both capable of comprehending and benefiting.</td><td>我建议让你们的客人借阅一份资料的复印本，因为他们都有能力理解并从中受益。</td></tr><tr><td>The material should be read from the beginning, with the exception of personal material which has been delivered this evening.There is no doubt that the development of matter, and an understanding of it, will enable you to manipulate it and also at times to discard it almost entirely.</td><td>除了今晚那些已经给出的个人资料外，这份资料应该从头开始读起。毫无疑问，物质的发展和对它的理解，将使你能够操纵它，有时也能几乎完全丢弃它。</td></tr><tr><td>Since the individual constructs matter, and indeed constructs his own physical universe, he can improve these constructions; and his expectations are intimately connected with the subconscious mechanism of construction itself.</td><td>既然个人建构了物质，并且确实建构了自己的物质宇宙，他可以改进这些构建；他的期待与建构本身的潜意识机制密切相关。</td></tr><tr><td>The thyroid gland operates strongly in regard to expectations, hormonal balances being maintained at rather normal levels normally.It is sensitive however to panic and fear, and, affecting other glands working with inner subconscious mechanisms, it becomes overly stimulated and causes subconscious mechanisms to actually create, in matter, the object of the fears which have themselves caused the initial over action.</td><td>甲状腺在期待方面的运作很强，荷尔蒙的平衡通常维持在相当正常的水平。然而，它对恐慌和恐惧很敏感，并且影响到与内在潜意识机制合作的其他腺体，它变得过度刺激，导致潜意识机制真的在实质上创造了恐惧的对象，而这些恐惧本身引起了最初的过度行动。</td></tr><tr><td>In the same manner, other constructions are affected.It is true that what becomes matter must be dealt with as matter, and yet the inner vitality and the inner self have their own ability to heal.The trouble is, these abilities are little utilized and seldom appreciated.</td><td>以同样的方式，其他建构也受到影响。的确，成为物质的东西必须作为物质来处理，然而内在的活力和内在的自己有它们自己的能力来疗愈。问题是，这些能力很少被利用、也很少被重视。</td></tr><tr><td>The mind constructs into matter its own idea of reality, and this is where personal expectation comes into play.You do not only create your own environment, generally speaking, you create it concretely, in forms of mass and matter.</td><td>心智将自己对实相的理念建构成物质，而这正是个人的期待发挥作用的地方。一般来说，你们不仅创造你们自己的环境，你们还以质量和物质的形态，具体地创造它。</td></tr><tr><td>You knock your head against walls that you yourselves have made.We will go into a long discussion concerning the actual physical and subconscious mechanisms involved in the construction of idea into material reality at a later session.</td><td>你用你的头去撞你自己制造的墙。我们将在以后的课程中，对实际的身体和潜意识机制进行长时间的讨论，这些机制涉及到将理念构建成物质的实相。</td></tr><tr><td>In line with this, please consider the material already given, concerning the ways in which atoms and molecules form a simple object, such as a chair.</td><td>本着这些说法，请斟酌已经给出的资料，涉及原子和分子组成一个简单物体的方式，例如一把椅子。</td></tr><tr><td>I will now close the session, somewhat early by a few moments or so, and again I would suggest that your visitors read as much material as possible.They are of course welcome to any session, but a familiarity with the material will add to the benefit that can be received by witnessing a live session; and indeed, I can be a lively one.I have been in my time quite reprobate.Ruburt does not allow me much leeway at present.I will now bid you all a fond good evening.Your psychological time experiments should go better next week.</td><td>我现在要结束这节课了，有点提前，我再次建议你们的客人，尽可能多地阅读这些资料。当然，我们也欢迎他们参加任何一堂课，但熟悉资料会增加亲自上课以外的额外好处；的确，我可以是一个活生生的人。在我的时代，我一直是个相当堕落的人。鲁柏现在不给我太多发)挥的空间。我现在要向大家道一声晚安。你们的心理时间实验下周应该会更顺利。</td></tr><tr><td>("How come?")</td><td>("为什么这样说？")</td></tr><tr><td>It has to do simply with the ebb and flow of your own energies; and we will have a session soon, dealing with the experiments which you have listed.</td><td>这与你们自身能量的起伏有关；我们很快就会有一节来讨论你们列出的那些实验。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth.

her eyes darkened as usual.She maintained these qualities all through the session.)</td><td>(珍开始轻声传述，对我的速记能力来讲，速度适中。她以均匀的速度在房间里踱步；她的眼睛像往常一样变黑。整节课都保持这种状态。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>I see that we are going to have a quiet session.</td><td>看得出我们将会有一节安静的课。</td></tr><tr><td>In all likelihood our sessions in this house are drawing to a close, but the house itself will be healthier for future inhabitants than it was before you came.</td><td>很有可能，我们在这栋房子里的课将接近尾声，但这栋房子对以后的住户而言，会比你们当初住进来之前更健全。</td></tr><tr><td>I was glad to see that Ruburt began the back exercises once more.The quietude and relaxation derived from them is excellent.Also a certain training in concentration is achieved.</td><td>我很高兴看到鲁柏又开始在做背部运动。从这些运动中得到的平静和放松是非常棒的。同时也达到了一定的专注训练。</td></tr><tr><td>This is going to be in some respects a relaxed session.I want to point out that the back exercises, because of the quietude and training in concentration, represent excellent practices for both of you, and for Ruburt in particular.His old thyroid condition has cleared up.What remains is again merely habit, although it was once closely connected to a physical disorder.</td><td>今天这节在某些方面会很轻松。我想指出的是，背部运动，因为宁静和专注力的训炼，对你们两个都是很棒的练习，特别是对鲁柏来说。他在甲状腺方面的老毛病已经解决。剩下的只是习惯问题，虽然它曾经与生理失调密切相关。</td></tr><tr><td>He is learning presently, and very well, to control this sometime condition; and it dwindles, to appear only occasionally in times of stress.Daily use of those particular back exercises, with their mental discipline, will further aid in his development, until he will find indeed that he can not only relax at will, but even when he does not have time to will relaxation, that is, relaxation will be the builtin conditioned reflex that panic used to be.</td><td>他目前正在学习，而且学得很好，控制这种时常出现的状况；这状况逐渐减少，只是在压力大的时候偶尔出现。每天做那些特定的背部运动，加上精神上的纪律，将进一步改善他的状况，直到他发现他不仅可以随意放松，甚至在他没有时间有意放松的时候也可以做到，也就是说，放松将成为内置的条件反射，取代曾经是的恐慌。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not mean, of course, that he will automatically turn into a jellyfish when a good fight may be called for.The use of psychological time, to some large degree, also performs this function.If he had set out, and he didn’t, to plan a process that would enable him to use his abilities to the fullest in his writing and other fields in which he is interested, and yet to discipline himself so that he did not scatter his abilities, if he had set out on a plan toward maturity, and to set definite controls upon his sometimes too fast, out-of-proportion responses, he could not have found a better path than the one which he is now following.</td><td>当然，我的意思不是说，当可能需要他去奋战的时候，他就自动变成一个软弱无能的人。心理时间的运用，在某种程度上，也发挥了这种功能。如果他已经着手——而他并没有——计划一个程序，使他能够在写作和他感兴趣的其他领域充分发挥他的能力，同时又能约束自己，使他的能力不至于分散，如果他已经着手计划走向成熟，并对他有时过快、不相称的反应设定明确的控制，他不可能找到一条比他现在所走的更好的路。</td></tr><tr><td>The use of full intuition with discipline and control, and a daily schedule that includes Contemplation and a temporary relaxation and slowing down of bodily process, [means] he will live longer because of this, and his work will be deeper and of greater import.</td><td>用纪律和控制来运用充分的直觉，以及包含冥想与暂时放松和放慢身体过程的日常作息，[意味着]他将因此而活得更久，他的工作将更深入，更有意义。</td></tr><tr><td>I mention this particularly because of his panic reactions last week at the gallery.You may include this material or not in the records, as you choose.He fears authority.This fear of authority is one of the reasons for his admirable independence of mind and spirit.</td><td>我特别提到这一点是因为他上周在画廊的惊慌反应。你可以自己决定是否把这个资料放进记录中。他害怕权威。对权威的恐惧，是他令人钦佩的心智与心灵得以独立的原因之一。</td></tr><tr><td>It is also the reason for many of his problems in the past, and to a much lesser degree in the present.His mother, representing authority to him as a child, was frightening, threatening, sometimes cruel, and capricious.The child took literally the mothers statements that though a cripple, she could walk at night, would turn on the gas jets, and so forth.</td><td>这也是在过去造成他许多问题的原因，现在的程度要小得多。作为孩子，他的母亲代表着权威，是可怕的、威胁的、有时是残酷的、任性妄为的。孩子一字一句地听进了母亲的话，即虽然腿脚不好，但她在晚上能走路，能打开煤气之类的，等等。</td></tr><tr><td>The child emotionally was almost paralyzed with terror, hence the thyroid condition, hence also the child’s quick motions, fast, frightened responses that were desperate defense mechanisms.The new director is a figure of authority, and insists in fact upon being considered in such a light.</td><td>这孩子在恐惧中几乎被吓呆了，因此有了甲状腺的病症，也因此产生那个孩子快速而恐慌的反应，那是处于绝望的防卫机制。这个新主管是一个权威人物，事)实上，他也坚持要从这样的角度来看待他。</td></tr><tr><td>At once our Ruburt is like a porcupine, feeling trapped and prickling all over, eyes glaring, and attitude more prickly than a porcupine’s quills.The fact that Ruburt considers the man an ass, helped, because Ruburt could then justify his own conditioned reflex toward authority; and keep in mind other material I have given you concerning Ruburt and the gallery.</td><td>我们的鲁柏立刻就像一只豪猪那样，感觉自己被困住了，浑身是刺，双眼喷火，态度比豪猪的毛刺还刺人。事实上，鲁柏认为这个人是个浑蛋，这有助于鲁柏证明自己对权威的条件反射是合理的；记住我给你的关于鲁伯和画廊的其他资料。</td></tr><tr><td>It is also true that during certain periods of the month his hormones are more active, since he inhabits, and is, a woman this time.He also turned down rather coldly the mans innocent enough invitation that you visit his home.You were indeed busy that evening, but this was not the reason for Ruburt’s refusal.</td><td>在每个月的某些时期，他的荷尔蒙也确实比较活跃，因为他这一世是个女人。他还相当冷淡地拒绝了那个男人够天真地邀你去他家做客的邀约。那天晚上你确实很忙，但这并不是鲁伯拒绝的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>He is bound to set himself up as aloof and superior to the man in charge.He may be superior in many ways, but certainly not in all respects, and his disdainful reactions would naturally affect the poor new director.About him I will have something to say.Nevertheless you were right, Joseph, and certainly Ruburt’s attitude is at least partially to blame.</td><td>他必然会对那上司摆出一副既冷漠又优越的模样。他可能在很多方面都高人一等，但肯定不是在所有方面，他的不屑反应，自然会影响到那可怜的新主管。关于他，我将有话要说。尽管如此，你是对的，约瑟，当然，鲁柏的态度至少也要负一部分的责任。</td></tr><tr><td>This indeed can be remedied, since Ruburt now is wise to it.The exercises and all the other measures which he has learned will stand him in good stead.The brooding, resentful inner mulling over of gallery problems is a tipoff that the panic bomb has been set off.But in this case he has thrown it out the window.</td><td>这件事确实可以补救，因为鲁柏现在对这种事已经变得聪明了。他所学到的练习和所有其他措施将使他保)持良好的状态。对画廊问题的耿耿于怀和怨气，是恐慌炸弹被引爆的一个提示。但这一次，他已经把它扔出了窗外。</td></tr><tr><td>In earlier years such a situation was faced by Ruburt in a blind panic run from one end of the continent to another.So we may say that he has improved.</td><td>在早些年，面对这样的情况，鲁柏是在盲目的恐慌中从大陆的一端跑到另一端。所以我们可以说，他已经进步了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane laughed.)</td><td>(珍笑出声。)</td></tr><tr><td>Again, your help was extremely beneficial.Relaxation, and in particular occasional whole days away, that is, an occasional whole day away, is excellent, and well worth any inconvenience it might cause.</td><td>同样，你的帮助是非常有益的。放松，尤其是偶尔的整日外出，就是说，偶尔的整日外出，是非常好的，这也许会造成某些不便，但值得。</td></tr><tr><td>It is extremely difficult for Ruburt not to throw himself wholeheartedly and completely into whatever it is he is doing; and so it is no wonder that now and again he loses his fairly adequate detachment on a job.But then he feels himself engulfed.</td><td>对鲁柏来说，不全心全意地、完全地投入到他所从事的任何事中是极其困难的；因此，难怪他时不时地在工作中失去了足够的超然性。然后他又觉得自己被吞噬了。</td></tr><tr><td>Do take your break.</td><td>休息一下吧。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:35.Jane was dissociated as usual.As in recent sessions during this heat wave, she was bothered not at all by heat and humidity while dictating, while I had to use a cardboard beneath my writing hand to avoid soaking the paper.Jane resumed in the same quiet, and at times much amused manner at 9:43.)</td><td>(9:35休息。珍解离如常。最近这几节课都在热浪中度过，她在传述的过程中，完全不受炎热和潮湿影响，而我却不得不用纸板垫在写字的手下方，以免浸)湿纸张。9:43，珍以同样安静的方式继续传述，有时还很开心。)</td></tr><tr><td>At the gallery, Ruburt interprets everything now between himself and the new director in terms of implied superiority or inferiority.</td><td>在画廊里，鲁柏现在把和他上司之间的每件事情，都当作一种暗示尊卑的对待关系。</td></tr><tr><td>He can’t crack a smile without fearing that this will be taken as a sign of apple polishing, because apple polishing of course implies a feeling of inferiority on the part of the apple polisher.To make sure that no such impression can be given by him, he resorts to sarcasm, and upon a few occasions downright rudeness, that is bound to make the receiver less than happy.</td><td>他甚至怕连他的一个笑容都会被对方当作一种拍马屁的行为，因为拍马屁这件事，当然就意味着拍马屁的人有一种自卑感。为了确保他不会给人留下这样的印象，他采用了讽刺的方式，在某些情况下，还会采用直接无礼的方式，这势必会使对方不太高兴。</td></tr><tr><td>He, your director, has gamely held his ground.His insistence upon detail Ruburt takes as personal offense.The man is simply a stickler for detail.He is not rubbing Ruburt’s nose in every misspelled word, nor is he suggesting, as Ruburt suspects, that Ruburt is a mental numbskull because he is a poor speller.</td><td>他，你们那位主管，毫不退让地坚持自己的立场。他对细节的坚持，被鲁伯认为是对他的冒犯。这个男人只不过是个拘泥细节的人。他并没有因为一个拼错的字，就指着鲁柏的鼻子大骂，也没有像鲁柏以为的那样，暗指鲁柏是个拼写能力差的笨蛋。</td></tr><tr><td>Privately, your director can see no reason why anyone who is educated cannot spell properly, but he has bent over backward not to give this impression.Out of pure perversity Ruburt has refused to learn how to spell.If authority says spell a word one way, Ruburt defiantly spells it another.</td><td>私下里，你们的主管看不出有什么理由，一个受过教育的人不能正确地拼写，而他已经放低身段，不给人这种印象。鲁柏拒绝去学怎么拼那个字，纯粹出于任性。如果权威说，这个字要用一种方式拼写，鲁柏绝对会挑衅地用另一种方式拼写它。</td></tr><tr><td>At the same time he chooses words as the basis for his art.Here he gets back at authority.He communicates to the authoritative world at large original, excellent, sharp and concessive ideas, through words that are consistently misspelled.</td><td>同时，他选择文字作为他艺术的基础。在这里，他对权威进行了反击。他透过一贯拼写错误的字词，向广大的权威世界传达了原创的、优秀的，犀利的，有说服力的想法。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not suggesting that he throw bouquets or roses at his rather flowery- attired male director, but he can at least hold back the daggers.You may find that the man can be most enjoyable in the future.He is extremely insecure, hiding behind compulsive attention to details.</td><td>我并不是在建议他，向那身着花衣的男主管抛出花束或玫瑰，但他至少可以收起他的敌意。未来你们可能会发现，这个人可以是最令人愉快的。他极度缺乏安全感，只好躲在对细节的强迫性关注背后。</td></tr><tr><td>He tends them so that they will guard him.They protect him from inner impulses.They are the pickets of his fence.They hide the inner extravagance which he fears, gives in to in partially accepted ways.He thrives on praise; so, true to form, the giant killer Ruburt insults him to his face.</td><td>他专注于那些细节，好让它们能保护他。它们保护他免于内在的冲动。它们是他围篱上的尖柱。它们掩盖了他所担心的、以部分接受的方式让步的内在放纵。他喜欢被追捧、被赞美；所以，不出所料，巨人杀手鲁柏就当面给他难堪。</td></tr><tr><td>He could be vindictive if treated in this manner for long, as rejection of the type that Ruburt is handing out frightens and confuses him.Ruburt is usually at least fair.The man has rather glaring faults, it is true, but they are not deadly ones. Nor would a bit of kindness be demeaning Ruburt.</td><td>鲁柏表现出来的排斥，让他既害怕又困惑，如果一直用这种态度对待他，他很可能会心怀报复。鲁伯通常至少是公平的。这个人有相当明显的缺点，这是事实，但它们不是致命的缺点，而且表现出一点点的善意也不会贬低鲁伯。</td></tr><tr><td>He, Ruburt, definitely thinks it would be.He can be extremely unbending, but I believe that this session will help matters considerably.I am speaking now of the situation as it exists in the present.Ruburt was jealous for his own authority at the gallery.He did not want to accept full responsibility for the gallery, and yet he wanted definite responsibility along definite, limited lines.</td><td>他，鲁柏，却认为会是这样。他可以是非常倔强的，但我相信这节课将对事情有很大的帮助。我现在说的是目前的情况。鲁柏对他自己在画廊的职权很在意。他不想扛起对画廊的全部责任，但又想明确地承担某些特定的责任。</td></tr><tr><td>When he has not sold any stories or books for a while, then he looks around for other ego satisfactions in the outside world, in other fields, for which he is actually not willing to pay the price.He is just not that interested in any career outside of writing.Had the ESP book been instantly grabbed up, nothing at the gallery would have bothered him.</td><td>当他有一段时间没卖出任何小说或书的时候，那么他就会在外界、在其他领域寻找其他的自我满足，其实他并不愿意在那些方面有所付出。他对写作之外的任何职业都不那么感兴趣。如果超感知觉(ESP)的书一下子就被抢购一空，那画廊里的一切都不会让他感到心烦。</td></tr><tr><td>He looks for satisfaction for his ego in the outside world when it has been bruised because of a rejection slip.Torrents of energy, both constructive and aggressive, suddenly are let loose where he works, and woe to all around.</td><td>当他的自我因一次退稿的事件而感到受伤时，他就会向外寻求补偿。能量的狂潮，极具建设性和侵略性，突然在他工作的地方被释放出来，哀鸿遍野。</td></tr><tr><td>He starts fighting for position and authority, for which under ordinary circumstances he couldn’t care less.This is confusing to those who work with him.This is not to say that he does not have grievances, or that he is not worth more money, but he wants more money for prestige reasons, rather than practical ones.</td><td>他开始争夺地位和权力，而这些，在通常情况下是他毫不在意的。这让那些和他一起工作的人感到不解。这并不是说他不曾发过牢骚，或他不值得更多的薪资，但他想要更多钱的理由是想证明他的身价，而不)是实际的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>If he is not able to see himself at all times as a successful, earning writer, then he feels like a fool in other areas also, and is suddenly enraged over situations at the gallery which, while not the best, hardly bother him at all when he is selling his writing.</td><td>如果他不能在任何时候都把自己看作是一个成功的、赚钱的作家，那么他在其他方面也会觉得自己是个傻瓜，并突然为画廊里的情况感到愤怒，但在他卖出自己的作品时，即使情况不是最好，画廊的事也几乎不会打扰到他。</td></tr><tr><td>I have forgotten. Take your break.</td><td>我忘了你们的休息时间，休息吧。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:11.Jane was dissociated as usual. Again, she had not been bothered by the heat while dictating. She said that even when Seth is talking about her, when she is balling herself out so to speak, she has no urge to interrupt him in her own behalf or defense.</td><td>(10:11休息。珍像往常一样解离，她还是一样，在传述期间，没有被炎热困扰，她说，即使是赛斯在谈论她的时候，也可以说，是当她在斥责自己的时候，她也没有为了自己，或为了辩护而中断他的传递。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same manner at 10:20.)</td><td>(10:20，珍以相同的方式恢复。)</td></tr><tr><td>This session should certainly help clear the situation generally, and certainly help Ruburt distinguish real grievances from projected ones.Ruburt can at least be pleasant.It should also help to still his frequent tirades at home against the gallery; but when his emotions do overflow or have overflown into speech, it has been beneficial, very much more so than if he had let them build up into a storm of frightening proportions.</td><td>这节课当然应该有助于大致理清状况，当然也有助于鲁柏区分真正的嫌怨与投射出的不满。鲁柏至少可以友善一点。这也应该有助于平息他在家里老是对画廊的事咆哮谩骂；但当他的情绪真的满溢出来，或已经泛滥成言语时，这也是有益的，比他让这些情绪积聚成一场可怕的风暴要好得多。</td></tr><tr><td>This, however, should begin to fade out.It would do no harm to invite the man for a drink in your home, though I admit that to either of you the suggestion amounts to a treason of sorts.It would do you, Joseph, no harm to allow him in your house, where you could size him up for yourself.One simple well- meant invitation might be in order—and this was hell to get through, with Ruburt’s blocks.</td><td>不过，这件事应该会开始慢慢消退了。邀请这个人到你家喝酒不会有什么坏处，尽管我承认，对你们中的任何一个人来说，这个建议都相当于一种叛逆。对你来说，约瑟，让他到你家里来并没有什么坏处，而且在这里，你可以自己观察他。一个单纯善意的邀请可能是有必要的——在鲁柏的阻挡下，要把这个传递过来还真难。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane ended the above sentence most vigorously.Shaking her finger at me, she voiced the words in an amused and forceful way.</td><td>(珍以一种最激烈的口吻说完了上述句子。一边说一边冲着我摇手指，她用一种顽皮而有力的方式说出了这些话。</td></tr><tr><td>("Then how did you do it?")</td><td>("那你是怎么做到的？")</td></tr><tr><td>Sheer bullheadedness on my part.The gesture would be well taken.One sign of plain friendliness on your parts would not open you up in any way.I couldn’t even get my full meaning through on that sentence.</td><td>纯粹靠我的牛脾气。这个姿态很能被接受。在你这一方，一个平淡友好的表现，不会以任何方式让你敞开。我甚至没能把我完整的意思表达在那句话上。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again came Jane’s wagging finger.)</td><td>(珍又摇了摇手。)</td></tr><tr><td>It might even help Ruburt to see the director when he was not in a position of authority that he felt honor bound to uphold.I did not mean to take the whole session up with private matter.Nevertheless it is well that this material came through.</td><td>这甚至可能有助于鲁伯看见那位主管卸下自己觉得当一个上司该有的架势时的样子。我并不是想用私人的事情来占用整节课。不过能把这资料传过来也是一件好事。</td></tr><tr><td>There is more that I would say, but I have aroused Ruburt enough for one night.He will get tense from blocking me if we continue along these lines.</td><td>我还有很多想说的，但是我在这一个晚上给鲁柏的刺激已经够多了。如果我们再继续谈这方面的事情，他会因阻挡我而变得紧绷。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane told me after the session that as she delivered these words, she abruptly realized that both her hands, thrust into the pockets of her slacks, were clenched tight.Indeed she was tensing, she knew.)</td><td>(珍在课程结束后告诉我，当她说出这些话时，她突然意识到她插在裤子口袋里的双手紧紧地握着。她确实在紧绷着，她知道。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will resume full blast on matter and its nature at our next session.I did want to make one point.The back exercises and the subsequent calmness will hasten the time when Ruburt is able to dispense with a dependence upon cigarettes.</td><td>我们将在下一节马力全开地继续讨论物质及其本质。我确实想说一点。背部运动和它带来的平静，将加速鲁伯得以摆脱对香烟的依赖。</td></tr><tr><td>In good seasons, the natural surroundings in which your house is located will help you both.And as you learn relaxation and mental discipline you will find more energy available for your work, for the sessions, and for the enjoyment of life in general.</td><td>在良好的季节里，你们的房子所处的自然环境，将对你俩大有助益。当你们学会放松与心灵修养时，你们会发现，有更多的能量可供你们用于你们的工作、用于上课，以及用于享受一般的生活。</td></tr><tr><td>I have been preparing your house for you.Do not forget my suggestion that you air out the cellar.</td><td>我一直在帮你们把房子准备妥当。不要忘了我的建议：你要把地下室通通风。</td></tr><tr><td>("How have you been preparing the house?"</td><td>("你是怎么筹备房子的啊？"</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth has mentioned this before; this time I was ready with my question when he mentioned this preparation again.But all I got for my pains was a smile from Jane.)</td><td>(赛斯之前也提过这件事，这一次我已经准备好等他再说到"筹备"这回事。但我的煞费苦心只换来珍的一个微笑。)</td></tr><tr><td>In my own way.</td><td>以我自己的方式。</td></tr><tr><td>("Oh.")</td><td>("哦"。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will not go into that at this time, as it involves matters which we have not discussed.If you have any other questions you may ask them.</td><td>我现在不谈这个，因为它涉及我们还没讨论过的事项。如果你有任何其他问题，你可以提出来。</td></tr><tr><td>A small note.I mentioned before that Ruburt will definitely benefit from a vacation, and you should travel someplace.I suggest near or to a large body of water, most preferably the ocean.</td><td>一个小小的说明。我之前提到，度假对鲁柏将大有助益，你们应该去某个地方旅行。我建议靠近或去一个有大片水域的地方，最好是海边。</td></tr><tr><td>The trip to your glen helped Ruburt to an amazing degree, and such small trips are excellent psychic refreshers, and also good for your work.Much of this material is not startling this evening, but it is necessary, and you will gain by taking it to heart.</td><td>到你们的溪谷那里走动一下对鲁柏的帮助会不可思议，这样的短程旅行是极好的精神振奋剂，对你的工作也有好处。今晚大部分的资料都不惊人，但它是必要的，把它放在心上，你们会有所收获。</td></tr><tr><td>You know how fond I am of you both, and you have no idea of how many unfortunate, possible circumstances you have avoided already by heeding my sometimes prosaic-sounding advice.I try to give you sound advice without pushing you in any direction, and this is often difficult.You will be using the possibility for good, for you, in this locality;

and all joking aside, the session did take quite a bit out of him, simply because he was inclined to block the material, though he did not in most instances.</td><td>首先，周一的课程击中了他的要害，可以这么说；撇开所有的玩笑不谈，那次课程确实让他消耗了不少精力，就是因为他想挡掉资料，尽管在多数情况下他没有阻挡。</td></tr><tr><td>His initial attempt at kindliness at the gallery the following day took more out of him, although he quickly saw that my diagnosis of the situation there was correct.</td><td>第二天，他在画廊里首次尝试的善意，更把他累翻了，不过他很快就看出，我对整件事的判断是正确的。</td></tr><tr><td>I would like to suggest that he begin reading again the body of the sessions.Not necessarily the Frank Watts material, but the later ones.There is much more of course to be said concerning matter, and allied subjects.</td><td>我想建议他重新开始阅读这些课的内容。不必是法兰克·沃茨那部分的资料，而是在那之后的内容。当然，关于物质，还有很多东西要讲，以及相关的主题。</td></tr><tr><td>I want to mention that while form is not a characteristic of matter, it is one of the characteristics of consciousness.The form which consciousness takes is usually composed of matter on your plane.The form perceived by your outer senses is always composed of matter, of course.There are also however forms or structures that are what you may call psychological forms or structures, even within your own field, which you do not perceive with your outer senses, but which are nevertheless frameworks that underlie form as it appears in matter.</td><td>我想说，虽然形态不是物质的特征，但它却是意识的特征之一。意识在你们的层面采用的形态，通常是由物质组成。当然，你们的外在感官所感知的形态，总是由物质组成。然而，即使在你们自己的场域内，也有一些形态或结构是你们可以称之为心理的形态或结构，你们用你们的外在感官并没有感知到，但它们却是显现为物质形态所据以建立的架构。</td></tr><tr><td>These psychological forms or structures have a reality and validity, composed of gestalts that exist in perspectives that you do not recognize.</td><td>这些心理形态或结构具有现实性和有效性，由完形们组成，这些完形们存在于你们不认得的视角内。</td></tr><tr><td>I have spoken in the past of depths that have nothing to do with space as you conceive space to be;

She still felt tired at break, she said, but all right while delivering the material.She resumed in the same manner at 9:35.)</td><td>(9:29休息。珍解离如常，她说她在休息时仍然感到疲惫，但在传讯资料时却还好。9:35以相同的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have been meaning to get into these subjects.We will only cover them rather superficially, I’m afraid, now; and go into them more deeply in connection with other topics.Nevertheless these psychological structures, again, are forms adopted by consciousness in a perspective not physically perceived.</td><td>我一直想着手讨论这些议题。现在，恐怕我们只能点到为止；在其它有关联的话题中再深入地讨论它们。然而，再说一次，这些心理结构是由意识在不被实质地感知到的视角中所采取的形态。</td></tr><tr><td>The individual attempts to project these psychological structures into physical reality, where they will then be known, realized, manipulated, and to some extent mastered as matter.</td><td>个体试图投射这些心理结构到物质实相中，好使它们能被认知、领会、操纵，并且可在一定程度上像物质一样被掌控。</td></tr><tr><td>To some extent then, physical structures are symbols of psychological structures; and psychological structures are adopted by consciousness and will be projected in many fields, differing in appearance and outward structure, but always following faithfully the inner psychological structure.</td><td>那么，在某种程度上，物质结构是心理结构的象征；心理结构被意识采用，并将被投射到许多领域，在外观和外在结构上有所不同，但总是忠实地遵循内在的心理结构。</td></tr><tr><td>I will make an analogy, though not perhaps an excellent one.Take any idea.Imagine portraying the idea in various ways.First however imagine that the particular idea itself has the psychological structure of a triangle.</td><td>我会打个比方，但或许不是一个很好的比喻。以任何理念为例。想像一下以各种方式描绘这个理念。然)而，首先想像一下，这个特定的理念本身具有三角形的心理结构。</td></tr><tr><td>Now imagine the idea, not of triangle, but the idea which has the shape of a triangle, being then expressed in architecture, in a philosophical dissertation, in color, in a sculpture, in a poem, in a painting, in music, and also in so-called natural phenomena such as the shape of a rock, the angle of a shadow, a portion of a crystal, a tree branch.</td><td>现在想像一下这个理念，不是三角形，而是具有三角形的形状的理念，然后在建筑、哲学论文、颜色、雕塑、诗歌、绘画、音乐以及所谓的自然现像中得到表达，比如岩石的形状、阴影的角度、水晶的一部分、树枝。</td></tr><tr><td>You will see that in the first mentioned examples the effect would be created by man in line with his abilities, and in the latter examples the effects would be created in some instances by what is sometimes called dead matter, but what we know as other forms of consciousness, according to their ability.</td><td>你会看到，在前面提到的例子中，效果是由人按照他的能力创造的，而在后面的例子中，效果在某些情况下，是由有时被称为死物质(deadmatter)的东西创造的，但我们知道，是其它形态的意识，根据它们的能力而创造出来的。</td></tr><tr><td>In all cases however, we would have material structure of one sort or another, created by consciousness according to its ability to perceive, manipulate and construct an inner psychological structure, in this case an idea, into material form.</td><td>然而，在所有情况下，我们都会有这样或那样的物质结构，由意识根据其感知、操纵和构建内在心理结构的能力创造成物质形态，在这个例子里，是一个理念。</td></tr><tr><td>There is no limitation upon the variety of inner psychological structure per se.Nevertheless, for various reasons having to do with the development of individual consciousness, as a rule only a small portion of the theoretically possible psychological structures can be utilized at any given point.</td><td>就内在心理结构的种类本身来说，没有限制。然而，基于与个人意识的发展有关的各种原因，通常只有理论上可能的心理结构的一小部分，可以在任一特定的点上被利用。</td></tr><tr><td>Therefore you have a certain similarity in the forms in which matter appears.Matter could therefore, even in your field, appear in many forms which are presently unknown to you.The psychological structure existing in a perspective which you cannot physically perceive, must be first put together by individual consciousness before it can then be constructed materially.</td><td>因此，在物质出现的形态上，你们有一定的相似性。因此，即使在你们的场域里，物质也可能以许多你们目前不知道的形态出现。心理结构存在于你们无法实质感知到的视角之内，必须先由个体意识将其组合起来，然后才能进行物质性的建构。</td></tr><tr><td>I have been speaking rather quickly and the material is new, so please take your break.</td><td>我说得比较快，资料也是新的，所以请大家休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:56.Jane was dissociated as usual.She had delivered the last breaks material while not wearing her glasses; she had paced as usual around the room, deftly avoiding furniture and other obstacles, in a way that ordinarily she would have had difficulty doing.She said being without glasses seemed to be no handicap.</td><td>(9:56休息。珍解离如常。她在传讯上述最后一段资料时没有戴眼镜；她像往常一样在房间里踱步，巧妙地避开家具和其他障碍物，这在平时是很难做到的。她说，不戴眼镜似乎并没有什么障碍。</td></tr><tr><td>(My writing hand felt no fatigue.During break I mentioned that I wondered whether Seth could tell us what Bill Macdonnel was doing on his vacation on Cape Cod., since we’d had but one card from him some time ago.The three of us had made plans to try some telepathic communication at certain times, but not hearing from Bill had sent these plans awry.See the 68th session, page 219.</td><td>(我写字的手没有感到疲劳。休息时我提到，我想知道赛斯是否能告诉我们，比尔-麦克唐纳在科德角度假时在做什么，因为我们前段时间只收到他的一张卡片。我们三个人曾计划在某些时候尝试一些心灵感应的交流，但没有比尔的消息，使这些计划搁浅了。见第68节课。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again without her glasses, Jane resumed at 10:02.)</td><td>(10:02珍继续传述，仍然没戴眼镜。)</td></tr><tr><td>There is therefore a process of psychological construction where basic psychological structures are manipulated and formed in a perspective which, physically, you do not perceive.</td><td>因此，有一个心理建构的过程，在这个过程中，基本的心理结构被操纵，并在一个实质上，你没有感知到的视角中形成。</td></tr><tr><td>This psychological construction takes place in what you call the subconscious.I have earlier explained that no real division exists between consciousness and sub-consciousness, both equally being conscious, and both being part of the same consciousness of the whole self.</td><td>这种心理建构发生在你们所说的潜意识中。我先前解释过，意识和潜意识之间不存在真正的划分，两者都同样是有意识的，都是整体自己之同一意识的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>The subconscious merely is aware of, and operates within, a very valid psychological perspective, with which the so-called conscious self is not familiar.Before physical construction can occur therefore, psychological perception, manipulation and construction of inner data or inner structures must be performed.</td><td>只不过，潜意识是在一个非常有效的心理视角之内运作，并能觉察那个视角，而所谓有意识的自己对此并不孰悉。因次，在物质建构得以产生之前，必须对内在资料或内在结构进行心理感知、操纵与建构。</td></tr><tr><td>These psychological structures and constructions are the basis for material construction, and therefore this inner manipulation of psychological structures is extremely important.</td><td>这些心理结构和建构是物质建构的基础，因此这种对心理结构的内在操纵是极其重要的。</td></tr><tr><td>We will take as an example hatred.Hatred does not exist as a basic psychological structure.It is, however, the result of psychological manipulation of fear; and fear is not a basic psychological structure.Survival is a basic psychological structure.</td><td>我们将以"恨"为例子。恨并不作为一种基本的心理结构而存在。然而，它是对恐惧的心理操纵之结果，而恐惧不是一种基本的心理结构。存活(Survival)是一种基本的心理结构。</td></tr><tr><td>Consciousness survival: construction of this basic psychological structure of consciousness survival must be interpreted, or projected or constructed, in terms of physical survival within your physical field.</td><td>意识存活(Consciousnesssurvival)：意识存活的这种基本心理结构之建构，必须以你们的物质场域内之实质的存活方式来诠释，或投射或建构。</td></tr><tr><td>Inadequate perception, manipulation, or construction in the psychological structure of consciousness survival leads to the psychological creation of fear and hatred.</td><td>意识存活之心理结构的感知、操纵或构建不足，导致恐惧和恨的心理产生。</td></tr><tr><td>The individual then constructs fear and hatred into physical construction, giving fear and hatred definite physical form.The error is in the original inability to perceive the correct inner data, the basic underlying psychological structure of consciousness survival.</td><td>然后个体把恐惧和恨构建成物质建构，赋予了恐惧和恨明确的物质形态。错误在于，最初没有能力感知正确的内在资料，即意识存活之基本的底层心理结构。</td></tr><tr><td>This error may become habitual, coloring all other psychological structures, and resulting in unfortunate and dangerous physical constructions.They are extremely destructive errors, and have many causes.The physical construction is then perceived by the outer senses as threatening and fearful, and influences through the outer senses the inner individual, so that he begins a vicious circle in an attempt to form further, more threatening physical constructions to combat the earlier ones.And the greater the number of such destructive physical constructions, the greater his expectation of further fear.</td><td>这个错误可能成为惯性，渲染其他的心理结构，造成不幸又危险的物质建构。它们是极具破坏性的错误，形成的原因很多。然后，这物质建构就被外在感官视为威胁和令人害怕，并通过外在感官影响内在个体，他因此开始了一个恶性循环，试图形成更多、更有威胁的物质建构来对抗先前的建构。这种破坏性的物质建构越多，他对有更多的恐惧之预期就越大。</td></tr><tr><td>I have hinted at the reasons for such errors.Habitual errors become part of the psychological perspective.Communication between individuals in the psychological perspective is almost exclusively telepathic, and is picked up early by the young from their parents. In the beginning, children actually begin their physical construction along lines telepathically received from their parents, at the same time that they learn their own manipulation in the psychological perspective.</td><td>我已经暗示了这种错误的原因。习惯性的错误变成心理视角的一部分。在心理视角中，个体之间的交流几乎完全是心灵感应的，一开始，孩子们实际上是按照从父母那里得到的心灵感应开始他们的物质建构，与此同时，他们在心理的视角内学习自己的操纵。</td></tr><tr><td>Using the analogy of consciousness survival and its distortion into fear and hatred, I have given you but one example of the ways in which basic psychological structures are misinterpreted with unfortunate results.</td><td>用意识存活及其扭曲为恐惧和恨的类比，我只是给你们举了一个例子，说明基本的心理结构被曲解，并导致不幸结果的方式。</td></tr><tr><td>I am leading up to the part that expectation plays in the construction of your physical environment, but you can see now why it was necessary that I explain the psychological perspective to you beforehand.</td><td>我正在引出，期待，在构建你们的物质环境中所扮演的角色，但现在你可以看出来，为什么我有必要事先)向你们解释心理视角了。</td></tr><tr><td>I now suggest your break.</td><td>我现在建议你们休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:28.Jane was dissociated as usual.She said she felt much better than when the session began.Again without her glasses, she resumed in the same manner at 10:33.)</td><td>(10:28休息。珍解离如常。她说，她感觉比课开始时要好得多。再一次，她没有戴眼镜，以同样的方式在10:33恢复。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will tonight or in a following session outline for you the basic psychological structures, as they are extremely important, for they form the basis for your physical constructions, and knowledge of them will let you know what you have to work with.</td><td>我会在今晚或下一节，为你们大纲一下基本的心理结构，因为它们极其重要，因为它们形成你们物质建构的基础，认知它们，会让你们知道，你们需要处理的是什么。</td></tr><tr><td>I will outline the basic ones with which you need be concerned, at any rate, since there are many others which do not concern you at this time.</td><td>我至少会把你们需要注意的那些基本心理结构作一个概述，因为还有许多其他的结构目前你们还不需要知道。</td></tr><tr><td>Understand that awareness is the criteria, however.There is no law limiting the number of psychological structures available to you, but because of your present development, and because of this alone, you are hampered.Experience or lack of it on various fields has not yet been possible, so practically speaking you have a limited number of basic psychological structures to deal with; and your perception, clear psychological understanding, intuitive comprehension of, and manipulation and psychological constructions of these basic structures, will determine the validity of your material constructions that will then form your environment.</td><td>然而要明白，觉知才是准则。没有任何规则，限制你们可用的心理结构的数量，但由于你们目前的发展状态，也仅只是因为这个原因，你们受到了阻碍。在各个领域的经验，或者缺乏经验，还没有可能，所以实际上，你们要处理的基本心理结构的数量有限；而你们的感知、清晰的心理认知，对这些基本结构的直觉)理解和操纵以及心理建构，将决定你们物质建构的有效性，然后形成你们的环境。</td></tr><tr><td>You can see that we have merely begun to scratch the surface here.You may, perhaps, glimpse what I mean in one way intuitively by considering what is meant when I say that your physical constructions form, or become the shape of, your environment in terms of what I have said about psychological form, period.</td><td>你可以看到，我们现在只是刚开始接触了一点皮毛。你可以，或许，以一种直观的方式瞥见我的意思，就我所说过的心理形态，想一想，当我说你们的物质构建组成，或成为你们环境的形状是什么意思，就是这样。</td></tr><tr><td>The shape of the physical environment, for example, is not static; though it is made of material it is not one thing at one place and within one time, and not something else.That is, the quality that you call environment, and speak of as if it were one thing with one shape and form always, is indeed at various times many things in many places, with you at the focal point.</td><td>例如，物质环境的形状并不是静止的；尽管它是由物质构成的，但它不是在一个地方和一个时间内的一个东西，而且不是其他东西。也就是说，你们所称的环境的品质，说得好像它是一样东西，总是有一个形状和形态，但实际上，它是随着你的焦点，在不同时间不同地点的许多事情。</td></tr><tr><td>You therefore at any time, physically, can change what you call your environment physically merely by changing your location.Environment therefore involves not a thing but a perspective that exists in relation to the individual.</td><td>因此，只要通过改变你的位置，你在任何时候都可以实际地改变你所谓的环境。所以，环境涉及的不是一个东西，而是一个与个人有关的视角。</td></tr><tr><td>Since physical environment of itself is not one thing that can be taken with you, but a relationship within a personal perspective, where then does the feeling of consistency of environment originate?</td><td>既然物质环境本身不是一件可以让你带走的东西，而是在个人视角内的一种关系，那么，环境之一致性的感觉源自哪里呢？</td></tr><tr><td>A man, for example, at various stages of his life may always be surrounded by books or fishing tackle, or a city or a countryside.They will not always be the same books or tackle, or city or countryside.But an individual's environment will nevertheless be seen to have a consistency of elements, a pattern of appearances, that can be called characteristic of him.</td><td>例如，一个人在他生命的不同阶段，可能总是被书籍或钓具、或城市或乡村所围绕。它们不会总是相同的书籍或钓具，或城市或乡村。但在一个人的环境方面，还是会被视为有一些元素的一致性，一种外观上的模式，这可以说是他的特征。</td></tr><tr><td>This sense of continuity in individual environment is a result of the individual’s characteristic way of constructing basic psychological structures into physical structures.</td><td>个人环境的这种持续感，是个人将基本心理结构建构成物质构建的特有方式的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>The basic psychological structures available have definite solidity, depth, mass, et cetera, in the psychological perspective, and they may be formed into numberless gestalt patterns, which are then constructed physically.The variations of construction are endless.There is nothing to force an individual for example to form psychological gestalts of hate and fear from the basic structure of consciousness survival.</td><td>在心理视角中，现有的基本心理结构具有明确的稳固性、深度、质量等等，它们可以形成无数的完形模式，然后再进行物质建构。建构的变化是无止境的。没有什么可以迫使一个人从意识存活的基本结构中，比如说，形成恨和恐惧的心理完形。</td></tr><tr><td>To do so represents an inability to perceive clearly the nature of the basic structure, and such an inability often carries over into habit so that other basic structures are also misinterpreted.</td><td>这么做，代表了没有能力清楚地感知基本结构的本质，这种能力不足，往往会延续到习惯中，从而使其它基本结构也被曲解了。</td></tr><tr><td>A setting—right in one small area of psychological perspective can, therefore, result in a beneficial turnabout in the manipulation of other basic structures, even though they seem unrelated.After one small note I would end the session.Happily, since the session has been an excellent one.</td><td>因此，在心理视角的一个小领域中的设置正确，可以导致在操纵其他基本结构方面的有益转变，即使它们似乎不相关。在一个小小的说明之后，我将结束这一节。开心地结束，因为这是非常棒的一节。</td></tr><tr><td>Your friend has made two friends, one older and one approximately his own age, both male.He is of course, or has been, near water.He has been at a bar with a large keg in it.There are two houses nearby, and a front room across from a beach.There is a boat and dock.I also believe he was in a group with four men, maybe something to do with a string of shells, also.</td><td>你们的朋友交了两位朋友，一位年纪较大，一位大约与他同龄，都是男性。他当然是，或一直是靠近有水的地方。他去过一间酒吧，里面有一个大酒桶。附近有两栋房子，还有一间前厅，对面是一片海滩。有一艘船和码头。我还相信他和四个人在一起，也许和一串贝壳也有关系。</td></tr><tr><td>Good night most fondly.</td><td>最深情的晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth."</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 11:03.Jane was dissociated as usual, although she said she was coming out of the state by the

errors.</td><td>(11:03结束。珍像往常一样解离，不过她说，在她提供关于比尔·麦克唐纳的最后一段资料时，她就脱离了出神状态。我注意到，她说话很谨慎，几乎是小心翼翼的，她证实了这一点，因为她不希望出错。</td></tr><tr><td>(It will be recalled that in the 68th session, page 221, in relation to Bill's projected trip, Seth had stated that he saw Bill meeting an older man "with prickly hair, "and that he saw a rowboat with a symbol on it.An older man and a boat both are mentioned above, and when Bill returns from Provincetown, Cape Cod, which is indeed on the ocean, it will be interesting to compare Seth’s material with what Bill actually saw and/or did.</td><td>(可以回顾一下，在第68节课上，关于比尔的计划旅行，赛斯曾说他看到比尔遇到了一位"头发像刺"的长者，他还看到一艘划船，上面有一个符号。长者和船都在第68节课上提到过，等比尔从普罗温斯敦，科德角回来时，那里确实是在海上，把赛斯所说的资料和比尔实际看到／或做的事对照一下将很有趣。</td></tr><tr><td>(My writing hand felt little

had good duration; at one time I felt as though I was turned to lie upon my right side, so that my left side was raised up.The feeling varied in intensity at times, and along with it I had the thrilling sensation in various limbs.</td><td>(8月1日，星期六，晚上9:00点，在躺下之前和躺下之后，我经历了我熟悉的震颤感，轻微但明确。一会儿之后，我注意到，现在已熟悉的升高感觉又出现了。首先，是我的左脚感觉有些上升，然后是我的左)手，最后是整个身体的左侧。这种相当愉快又明确的感觉持续了好久；有一次我感觉自己仿佛转过身来躺在右侧，所以我的左侧被抬高了。这种感觉的强度有时会有变化，而且伴随着这种感觉，我的各个肢体都有刺激感。</td></tr><tr><td>(Toward the end of the experiment, I saw Jane enter my field of vision from the right side.

We thought briefly of asking for a special session to deal with the rather surprising turn of events, but decided against it, not wanting to cultivate any such dependent habits. My personal thought was that our expectations concerning the house had been in the process of change, the loss of the loan being the natural culmination of this.</td><td>(贷款申请被驳回这件事引起了许多问题，因为赛斯没说过任何这样的事；从另一方面来说，他的预测都是以"如果"或类似的话作为开头。我们也略想过要求上一节特别课，来处理这个相当意外的转折，但后来决定不这么做，因为我们不想养成任何这样的依赖习惯。我个人的想法是，我们对这所房子的期待一直在改变过程中，贷款的失败是这一过程的自然结果。</td></tr><tr><td>(Of course we could still have obtained the house through a bank loan, which was offered to us, but we declined, feeling our ideas had changed in some way as yet unclear to us;yet we felt it was tied up with the material, meager as yet, that Seth has been giving us concerning the power of expectation.</td><td>(当然，我们仍然可以通过银行贷款买到这栋房子，银行也向我们提供了贷款，但我们谢绝了，觉得我们的想法已经以某种方式改变了，但我们尚不清楚；然而，我们觉得这与赛斯一直在给我们的资料有关，虽然这资料还很少，就是关于期待的力量。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again, Jane was not nervous before the session began. She did not feel very energetic, and as happened in the 75th session, 9 PM came and passed.She did begin dictating at 9:02, in a natural voice and in a deliberate, comfortable manner. Her eyes darkened as usual.)</td><td>(再次，珍在课开始前并不紧张，她并不觉得很有活力，就像第75节那样，晚上9点到了，又过了。她确)实在9:02分开始传述，声音自然，态度从容自在。眼睛变黑如常。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth. ")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will now begin the session.</td><td>我要开始这一节了。</td></tr><tr><td>I will explain in due time the circumstances surrounding your house, or if you prefer I will go into them this evening.</td><td>我将在适当的时候，解释与你们的房子有关的情况，或者如果你愿意，我会在今晚谈谈它们。</td></tr><tr><td>("It doesn’t matter."</td><td>("随便都可以。")</td></tr><tr><td>(I thought any additional material on expectations might help explain the house situation.)</td><td>(我想，任何关于期待的补充资料，都可能有助于解释房子的情况。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will, then, begin with a short treatise concerning the importance of expectation, not only in the construction of physical objects from inner data, but also in the importance played by expectation in the actual sifting of inner data that is received, and in the importance of expectation in the interpretation of inner data after the sifting process has been carried about.</td><td>那我就从关于期待的重要性的简短论述开始吧，它的重要性，不仅在把内在资料建构为实质物体这方面，而且在实际筛选所收到的内在资料时，期待所发挥的重要性，还有在筛选过程进行后，对内在资料的诠释，期待也有着重要的作用。</td></tr><tr><td>("Do you mean carried out?")</td><td>("你的意思是执行(carriedout)吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>Carried about.Expectation, perhaps more than any other quality, characterizes the individual, and represents the innermost aspects of his personality.It is the framework for his physical constructions, and more than atoms and molecules it represents the psychic building blocks from which his constructions will be erected.</td><td>所携带的(Carriedabout)。期待，也许比其他任何品质都更能体现个人的特征，并反映出他人格内在最深处的面向。它是他的物质建构的框架，比起原子和分子，它代表了灵性的构建模块(psychicbuildingblocks)，而他的建构将从中建立起来。</td></tr><tr><td>We have already spoken of psychic constructions, and we have said that physical shapes are built upon inner psychic frameworks.Emotions then, in their own realm unperceived by the outer senses, have their own solidity, shape, and it is from these that your expectations are formed.</td><td>我们已经说过灵性建构，也说过物质的形状是建立在内在的灵性架构上。那么，情绪，在不被外在感官所感知的自己的领域里，则有它们自己的实度(solidity)，形状，而你们的期待正是由这些形成的。</td></tr><tr><td>The emotions indeed do form the expectations, and it is not the other way around.</td><td>情绪的确形成了期待，而不是反过来。</td></tr><tr><td>As physical objects can be manipulated, so can the emotions be manipulated, so can they be combined into various shapes and psychic constructions.A mans expectations are the result of his emotional heritage, and his own ability to understand and manipulate that heritage.</td><td>正如实质的物体可以被操纵，情绪也可以被操纵，它们可以被组合成各种形状和灵性构建。一个人的期待是继承了他的情绪的结果，以及他自己理解和操纵那份继承的能力。</td></tr><tr><td>If he manipulates that heritage well, then his expectations will work for him.The emotions are to be used and enjoyed as psychic building blocks.There is no law, however, stating that a man cannot instead throw these blocks to the winds and hope that when they fall down they might possibly fall into a castle.</td><td>如果他很好地操纵那份继承，那么他的期待就会为他效力。情绪要作为灵性构建模块来使用和享受。然)而，没有任何一条法则表示过，一个人不能把这些构建模块抛向风中，并希望当它们落下时，可能会堆成一座城堡。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, expectations are not only vital in the formation of physical constructions, but they also determine what inner data of all available, will be received by the individual; and then the individual interprets the data in terms of the same expectations.</td><td>话说回来，期待不仅对物质构建的形成至关重要，它们还决定了所有可用的内在资料哪些会被个人接收；然后个人再根据同样的期待来诠释所收到的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>The core of individuality, then, is the individual’s expectations, for he will truly get what he wants, individually and collectively.</td><td>那么，个体性的核心就是这个个体的期待，因为他真的会得到他想要的，无论是逐一获得还是整体实现。</td></tr><tr><td>If a man wants to change his fate, desire is not enough, but expectation is.Desire may grow into expectation, but alone it is not enough.Expectation is actually the main trigger that switches inner data into the realm of physical construction.Without it, no physical construction results.</td><td>如果一个人想要改变他的命运，仅有欲望是不够的，期待才是。欲望可能会发展成期待，但仅有欲望并不够。期待实际上是将内在资料切换到物质建构领域的主要触发因素。没有它，就不会有物质建构的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>This is extremely valuable information, particularly concerning the part played by expectation in the sifting of available data.Expectation is somewhat influenced also by past existences, and yet not enough to be binding upon the present personality.</td><td>这是非常有价值的信息，特别是关于期待在筛选可用资料上所扮演的角色。期待也有点受到过去存在的影响，但还不足以对现在的人格产生约束力。</td></tr><tr><td>An expectation of danger will indeed create danger.An expectation of success will create success.This is put very simply and yet there is nothing, in practical terms, more valid, since expectation has behind it the motivating force of the personality, and utilizes on a subconscious level strong abilities and comprehensions.</td><td>对危险的期待确实会缔造危险。对成功的期待将创造成功。这句话说得很简单，但以实际的角度来说，没有什么比这更有效的说法了，因为期待的背后有这个)人格的推动力，并在潜意识层面利用强大的能力和理解力。</td></tr><tr><td>Expectation is the force, then, that triggers psychic realities into physical construction.</td><td>所以，期待是触发灵性实相成为物质建构的那股力量。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your first break.</td><td>我建议你们的第一次休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26.Jane was dissociated as usual.She delivered the above material with quite a few pauses, and appeared to be choosing her words carefully.She resumed in the same manner at 9:32.)</td><td>(9:26休息。珍解离如常。她传递上述资料时，停顿了好几次，似乎在小心翼翼地选择她的词语。9:32她以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>In your physical field, and this limitation is important, in your physical field, truths are often caused by, or are the result of, expectations worked out.Therefore, if you believe for example that excellent artists must be poverty stricken, then this will be a part of your overall expectation framework; and for you it will indeed be, and exist as, a truth.</td><td>在你们的物质场域中，这个限制是重要的，在你们的物质场域中，事实往往是期待造成的，或者是期待成真的结果。所以，如果你们相信，比方说，杰出的艺术家必定是穷困的，那么，这就会是你整体期待架构的一部分；对你来说，它将真的会是一个事实，一个存在的事实。</td></tr><tr><td>If you became wealthy, you would then be in danger of losing your ability, since in your realm of expectation ability of this nature and wealth do not exist simultaneously.To protect your ability then, you would rigorously fight to retain your poverty.</td><td>如果你变得富有，那么你就会有失去能力的危险，因为在你的期待领域里，这种性质的能力和财富不会同时存在。那么，为了保护你的能力，你会拼命留住你的贫穷。</td></tr><tr><td>If another man, for example, does not believe that artistic talent of high degree cannot exist side by side with wealth, then your truth is not his truth, and he is not threatened by wealth, nor is his ability.</td><td>如果另外一个人，比方说，并不相信卓越的艺术才华无法与财富并存，那么，你的事实就不是他的事实，财富便不会对他造成威胁，他的能力也不会受到威胁。</td></tr><tr><td>It may even improve.Since I have said that expectations are formed by the emotions, then it is obviously the basic emotions themselves that must be manipulated, since the expectations are the frameworks formed by the emotions.This is the starting point.</td><td>他的能力甚至可能提高。既然我说过，期待是由情绪形成的，那么显然，必须操纵的是基本情绪本身，因为期待是由情绪形成的架构。这就是起点。</td></tr><tr><td>It is pointless to ignore the fact that you feel hatred, even though hatred is a distortion of a basic psychic mobility.Unless you learn never to distort the basic consciousness survival in terms of hatred, you will always have to deal with seemingly unresolved hatreds and aggressions.</td><td>忽视你感觉恨的事实是没有意义的，尽管恨是对一个基本的灵性流动的扭曲。除非你学会永远不要用恨来扭曲基本的意识存活，否则你将永远要面对似乎未化解的恨和攻击性。</td></tr><tr><td>Aggressions are merely the result of energy not clearly directed, invalid survival patterns.If these aggressions are not handled with some degree of success, they will form themselves into expectations, where they will then let forth their power in the formation of unfortunate constructions.</td><td>好斗只是能量没有明确指向的结果，是无效的存活模式。如果这些攻击性没有得到一定程度的成功处理，它们会将自己形成期待，然后在那里释放出它们的力量，形成不幸的建构。</td></tr><tr><td>Emotions, or emotional energy, can be transformed rather easily from one to the other.The energy in hate can be utilized in love, for example.However, aggressions can be turned into constructive terms if care is used. Aggressions should be, as soon as possible after their recognition, turned into constructions.If not, consciously you forget the aggression; the energy stores up until it explodes in what we will call an unsupervised construction.</td><td>情绪，或情绪能量，可以相当容易地从一种转化为另一种。例如，在恨里的能量，可以在爱中得到利用。然而，如果谨慎使用，攻击性可以转化为建设性的条件，在认识到攻击性后，应尽快将其转为建设。否则，你会有意识地忘记这攻击性；这能量会积聚起来，直到它在我们所说的无监督的建构中爆发出来。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt’s almost instant reaction following the G.I. notice was, here, excellent.The aggressive feeling, unharnessed, would have caused difficulties at the gallery, and even in your personal relationship.His seeking out of his friend, your landlady, was beneficial, since in harmless talk and chatter much aggressive energy was harmlessly constructed.</td><td>鲁伯在接到政府贷款部门的通知后，几乎立即做出反应，这一点非常好。攻击性的感觉，如果不加以控制，会在画廊里造成麻烦，甚至也会在你们的私人关系中造成麻烦。他去找他的朋友，你们的房东太太，是有好处的，因为在无害的聊天谈话中，许多攻击性能量被无害地建构起来。</td></tr><tr><td>The almost immediate bustling about in the apartment was even better.He was already geared for action and physical activity.A temper tantrum, such as dish throwing, would have been more effective than no action, though not the best sort of solution.</td><td>在公寓里立刻喧闹会更好。他已经准备好采取行动并进行肢体活动。发顿脾气，比如扔盘子，会比没有行动更有效，虽然不是最好的解决办法。</td></tr><tr><td>The constructive changing around of the apartment was instinctively correct, however, as was your agreement in both of these instances.Physical activity is an excellent way of using and controlling the effect of aggressive reaction, and will prevent the buildup of aggressive emotions into unsupervised physical constructions, and also prevent the habitual piling up of such aggressions, where detrimental constructions result continually.</td><td>不过，建设性地改变公寓是本能地正确，正如在这两种情况下你都同意一样。身体的活动是利用和控制攻击性反应的影响之绝佳办法，可以防止好斗情绪积聚成物质建构，也可以防止这类攻击性的惯性堆砌，导致有害的建构不断产生。</td></tr><tr><td>Except for disappointment in his writing, Ruburt almost instinctively operates within a beneficial pattern in this respect, and you are certainly progressing.Nor is it foolish to consider improvements in your apartment under the circumstances of which we are speaking.</td><td>除了对他的写作感到失望以外，鲁伯在这方面几乎是本能地在一种有益的模式内运作，你当然也在进步。在我们所说的这种情况下，考虑一下改善你们的公寓，也不是愚蠢的做法。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:00.Jane was dissociated as usual.She said she now had the feeling that Seth would begin to discuss the affair of the house if we wanted him to.Talking it over, we decided to let Seth bring up the subject when he wanted to.So we asked no questions at break.</td><td>(10:00休息。珍解离如常。她说，她现在有种感觉，如果我们想要赛斯谈房子的事，他就会开始谈谈。经过讨论，我们决定等赛斯想谈的时候，由他提起这个话题。所以我们在休息时没有问任何问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same deliberate manner, with many pauses, at 10:12)</td><td>(10:12珍以同样慎重的方式继续传述，并多次停顿。)</td></tr><tr><td>There is no getting around what I have said.Emotional power behind your expectations powers your expectations into physical reality.</td><td>我所说的是无法回避的。你的期待背后的那股情绪力量，加强了你的期待成为物质实相。</td></tr><tr><td>The subconscious, as you call it, represents a tremendous raw power that triggers forth into construction according to the expectations which you form from the emotions.The intellect should help you understand this power plant, so that you can switch your power where it is needed.The intellect should operate like an x-ray, enabling you to see inward.</td><td>潜意识，如你所称之的，代表着一股巨大的原始力量，它根据你从情绪中形成的期待激发出建构。智性)应该帮助你理解这个发电厂，这样你就可以把你的力量切换到需要之处。智性应该像X光那样运作，使你能够向内看。</td></tr><tr><td>While many of your expectations are formed in childhood, no switch is really stuck in one position, and it is your prerogative to channel your emotional energy into whatever pattern for action you desire.It is extremely important, if difficult, to probe and to discover exactly what your present expectations are.Not your desires but your expectations, for you will only construct physically that environment which you believe capable of construction.It has been said that oftentimes men’s expectations are too high for their abilities, but indeed expectations form abilities:and if expectations were higher, so would abilities flourish.</td><td>虽然你们的许多期待是在童年时期形成的，但没有一个开关是真正卡在一个位置上，把你的情绪能量引导到你想要的任何行动模式上，是你的特权。探究和发现你目前的期待到底是什么，即使很困难，也是极其重要的。不是你的欲望，而是你的期待，因为你只会在物质上建构你认为你有能力构建的环境。有人说，人们的期待常常高过他们的能力，但其实是，期待形成能力；如果期待更高，能力也会更兴旺发达。</td></tr><tr><td>These are all practical aspects concerning the construction of inner data into physical matter, and no more practical information could be given to you.I would suggest, Joseph, that you received the early idea that a true artist could not be wealthy.You knew subconsciously that you were an artist.The moment that you consciously realized you were an artist, you ceased the attempt to make good money, fearing it would rob you of your ability.</td><td>这些都是关于将内在资料建构成实质物质的实用方面，没有比这更实用的信息可以提供给你了。约瑟，我会说，你早期得到的想法是，一个真正的艺术家不可能是富有的。你潜意识里知道自己是个艺术家。而你在意识上认知到你是一位艺术家的时候，你就停止了赚大钱的尝试，因为你担心这会夺去你的能力。</td></tr><tr><td>(By now, Jane's delivery was becoming more forceful and animated, although she exhibited no voice changes of note.)</td><td>(现在，珍的传述变得更有力和生动，但在声音上并没有值得注意的变化。)</td></tr><tr><td>As long as you believe this so will your expectations of reality become, in truth, reality.It goes without saying that if all of your energy goes into money making little will be left for painting, but this is a long stretch between this equation and the one that says that an artist must be poor.</td><td>只要你还这样相信，你对实相的期待就会成为真实的现实。不用说，如果你把所有的能量都用在赚钱上，就没什么精力留给绘画了，但是把这件事和艺术家一定很穷画上等号，这等号之间是有很长的距离的。</td></tr><tr><td>There is much leeway here.I would, if I may, suggest a reinforcement unfortunately in this sort of expectation.I would suggest on your part a rather illogical but perhaps understandable feeling of guilt, involving your father.I would suggest, indeed, that perhaps you hesitate as the first son, to be more financially solvent than your father is, and therefore in your own eyes symbolically shame him.</td><td>这里有很大的余地。如果可以的话，我会说，这类的期待，很遗憾地，有一种强化作用。我会说，就你而言，有一种很不合逻辑但可以理解的愧疚感，与你父亲有关。我会说，其实，你身为家中的长子，也许你会犹豫是否要在经济上比你父亲更有能力，因为在你自己眼中，这象征性地羞辱了他。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's voice had become suddenly very loud.The next word she uttered was the word "indeed, " beginning the next sentence.I wrote it down as usual; then, walking over to me, grinning but also intent, she took the pen from my hand; she herself wrote the word down at the top of the page, in letters 3/4 of an inch high, and underlined it heavily for emphasis in no uncertain terms.)</td><td>(珍的声音突然变得很大声。下一句她脱口而出的第一个词是"确实如此"。我像往常一样把它写了下来；然后，她走到我身边，咧嘴一笑，但也是刻意为之的，她从我手中拿过笔；自己把这个字用3/4英寸高的字母写在了纸张的上方，并在字下面划了重重的底)线，以明确地强调它。)</td></tr><tr><td>Indeed.</td><td>确实如此。</td></tr><tr><td>I would suggest also, if you will forgive me perhaps, a completely natural fear of incestuous relationship with your mother.Nothing would please her more than money, and you fear that if you made more money than your father, he would feel that you were doing this purposely, to take her away.</td><td>如果你不介意的话，我还会说，你对与你母亲那说不清关系的恐惧是完全自然的。没有什么比金钱更能让她高兴的了，而你担心，如果你赚的钱比你父亲多，他会觉得你是故意这么做，好把她带走。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane smiled broadly, facing me with one foot up on a chair.)</td><td>(珍面对着我，一只脚踏在椅子上，咧着嘴笑着。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, what you would want to do with a seventy two year old woman is beyond me.Forgive my humor, since the subject is serious.I couldn’t resist.But, all of these inner psychological realities color your expectations, just as Ruburt is entirely convinced that a writer of real merit cannot bear children.</td><td>现在，你想对一个七十二岁的老女人做什么，我不知道。请原谅我的幽默，因为这个话题很严肃。我忍不住。但是，所有这些内在心理实相都会渲染你的期待，就像鲁柏完全相信，一个卓越的作家不能生儿育女一样。</td></tr><tr><td>With him, however, the reinforcements are so perilously intertwined that I will make no attempt to straighten this out.His framework of personality is now so bound to this nonexistent truth that it would be dangerous for me to tamper with it.</td><td>然而，对他来说，这些强化是如此危险地交织在一起，所以我不会试图去理顺这一点。他的人格架构现在已经和这个不存在的事实紧紧捆绑在一起，所以我若搅乱它会很危险。</td></tr><tr><td>You are secure as long as you put a good portion of energy into painting, but this distortive expectation of yours could end up making you bitter even against your painting; because even when you are pleased with your work, it could tend, definitely, to prevent you, in strong terms, from seeking not only financial reward from it, but other satisfactions as well by preventing you from showing it where such showing in galleries and exhibitions throughout the country is important.</td><td>只要你将大部分精力投入到绘画中，您就会很安全，但你这种扭曲的期待，最终可能使你甚至对你的绘画也感到痛苦；因为即使你对你的作品感到满意，它也可能，肯定会，强烈地阻止你从中寻求经济回报，以及其他的满足感，因为它阻止你在全国各地的画廊和展览中展示它，而这种展示很重要。</td></tr><tr><td>Such a veto upon exhibitions for example is not part of your distortive expectation now, but could easily become part of it.All expectations evolve, valid and invalid ones.</td><td>例如，这种对展览的否决，现在还不是你扭曲的期待的一部分，但很容易成为它的一部分。所有的期待都在演变发展，有效的和无效的都是如此。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not as you should know, suggesting an eight-hour job.I am suggesting that you examine as objectively as possible your own basic expectations, for this will help you, and is a basic step in changing them for the better.</td><td>你应该知道，我并不是在建议你一天八小时的工作。我是建议你尽可能客观地审视你自己的基本期待，因为这将有助于你，而且是使它们往好处改变的一个基本步骤。</td></tr><tr><td>Your talent is indeed excellent, and of the highest quality.Many artists have produced and received profit for their productions.There is certain work that you could do that could be compared to Ruburt's science fiction; that is, commercial in that it brings in money, and yet expresses an intuitive and creative part of the personality and is not, as you say, hack work.</td><td>你的才华确实杰出，而且是极高的品质。很多艺术家都创作了他们的作品，并得到了利润。有某些特定的工作你可以做，就像鲁柏写科幻小说；也就是说，商业性的，因为它能带来金钱，但又能表达人格中的直觉和创造性部分，而不是像你说的那样，是个佣工活。</td></tr><tr><td>In your field of art you could do better now than he is in science fiction, since you are more sure of how you get your effects, and he is still not.Your fear of freelance work is mainly, but not entirely, caused by your distortive expectation.On the one hand you fear making too much money, while consciously you fear not making enough, for the energy expanded; and I do mean expanded, rather than extended.</td><td>在你的艺术领域，你现在可以比他在科幻小说方面做得更好，因为你对如何得到你想要的效果更有把握，而他还没有。你对自由职业的害怕主要是，但不完全是，由你扭曲的期待造成的。一方面你害怕赚太多钱，而在意识上你又担心赚得不够，因为能量扩展了；我的确是说扩展(expanded)，不是延伸)</td></tr><tr><td>This expectation of yours, this fear of making money, is a strong element in your psychological makeup, and beside the reasons already given, there is a subconscious need to punish your mother.You realize that she pushed your father to make money, and no one, including yourself, will ever be allowed to do the same to you.So goes the inner reasoning.</td><td>你的这种期待，这种对赚钱的畏惧，在你的心理构成中是一个强烈的元素，除了已经给出的原因之外，还有一种惩罚你母亲的潜意识需求。你知道她强迫你父亲去赚钱，没有人，包括你自己，能被允许对你做同样的事。所以这是内在的原由。</td></tr><tr><td>I point this out for your benefit.Again, I do not suggest that you rush out and get a fulltime job, or that you spend all your energies freelancing.</td><td>我指出这一点是为了你好。再次强调，我不是建议你急忙去找一份全职工作，也不建议你把全部的精力都用在自由职业上。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again Jane took the pen from my hand and underlined the word "all" in the above sentence.Her voice was not so loud now.</td><td>(珍再次从我手中拿过笔，在上述句子中的"全部"一词下划线。她的声音现在不那么大声了。</td></tr><tr><td>("Are you having fun tonight?")</td><td>("你今晚玩得开心吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>I am having a ball.It amuses me to have to point out these homey truths to you; and so that Ruburt doesn’t feel neglected, I’ll get to him again one of these days.</td><td>我今天特别开心。让我觉得好玩的是，我得抖出你家这本难念的经；我改天再来料理鲁柏一顿，这样他就不会觉得被忽视了。</td></tr><tr><td>I do suggest that with your abilities, if you can straighten out your expectations, that you can be much more comfortably situated, and that you will be if you straighten out your expectations.I also suggest that you subconsciously and consciously knew from the first that Ruburt's expectations along these lines coincided exactly with your own.You reinforced each other beautifully.</td><td>我确实建议，以你的能力，如果你能理顺你的期待，你的处境会比现在舒服很多，你会的，如果你理顺了你的期待。我还要说，你从一开始就下意识地和有意识地知道，鲁伯在这些方面的期待与你自己的期待完全吻合。你们两个很美妙地强化了彼此的期待。</td></tr><tr><td>Anything you gave him was more than he had, and much more than he ever expected.This is also quite important, and your mother knows this.That is why at times she suspects that Ruburt is in league with you against her, as indeed he is.</td><td>你给他的任何东西都比他拥有的多，而且比他所期待的多得多。这一点也相当重要，你母亲也知道这一点。这就是为什么她有时会怀疑鲁伯与你联合起来对付她，而鲁伯确实是这样。</td></tr><tr><td>You are bending over backward not to make money, both of you, though this is somewhat more understandable on Ruburt's part, at least since his training is not as specific.When either of you demand or request more money, you feel like thieves.Ruburt has yet to manage his abilities competently but you have except for this distortive expectation which colors your constructions.</td><td>你不为五斗米折腰，你们两个都一样，不过这一点在鲁柏方面更容易理解，至少因为他受的训练没那么专门。当你们中的任何一人要求或想要更多钱的时候，你们就觉得好像是小偷。鲁柏还未能完全掌控他的能力，但你已经能做到了，除了这个影响了你的建构的扭曲期待。</td></tr><tr><td>It did not you see before you realized that you were basically an artist, because then the two elements of talent and money were not in contact.You could have made a much less painful transition between complete commercialism and painting than you did, but here at a crucial moment was starry-eyed, Ruburt, with his ideas of the poverty-stricken artist; and you can carry on from there.</td><td>在你意识到自己基本上是个艺术家之前，你并没有看到这一点，因为那时才华和金钱这两个元素并没有接触过。在完全商业和绘画之间，你原本可以经历不那么惨痛的转换期，但在关键时刻，满眼梦幻的鲁柏，带着他穷艺术家的想法出现了；你可以从那里继续下去。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not believe it possible myself, because of your makeup, that you will ever be a millionaire, though I could be wrong.But with the same expenditure of energy, you could be much better off with a change in expectation, and the resultant change in the direction of your energy construction.</td><td>由于你的性格，我自己也不相信你会成为一位百万富翁，但我也可能是错的。不过，以同样能量的消耗，通过改变期待，以及由之而来的能量建构方向的改变，你可以得到更好的发展。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, Ruburt also has his fear of money.He fears that it will be taken away, and therefore is afraid of having it to begin with.This is a highly ridiculous notion, caused by an infantile interpretation of events in his grandfather’s life, and also by the fear that his mother would steal him blind of anything that he possesses.</td><td>话说，鲁柏也有他对金钱的恐惧。他害怕金钱会被夺走，所以打从一开始就害怕拥有它。这是非常荒谬的想法，起因于他对他祖父生命中的一些事件的幼稚解读，也因为害怕他的母亲会把他拥有的任何东西都偷走。</td></tr><tr><td>He will write a story otherwise not only excellent but saleable, and put in one or two lines and a tinge throughout the tale, to make it unsaleable.</td><td>要不然他会写一本不仅极佳而且卖得出去的故事，然后在里面加入一两句话及一抹色调贯穿这个故事，使它销不出去。</td></tr><tr><td>Since this sort of expectation allies you both, you both should try to overcome it, since if one doesn’t there would be a troublesome, though not critical, discrepancy that could at least temporarily bother your relationship.</td><td>既然这种期待将你们两个联盟在一起，你俩都应该努力克服它，因为如果其中一人不那么做，就会有一个步调不一的问题，虽然不是关键，至少会暂时影响你们的关系。</td></tr><tr><td>If your hand is tired, I will give you a break, or end the session.</td><td>如果你的手累了，我会让你休息一下，或结束课程。</td></tr><tr><td>("Well, it's getting tired."</td><td>("🗎，是越来越累了"。</td></tr><tr><td>(True; I had taken down the last few pages at top

such material is extremely useful, and that knowledge is seldom so easily gained?</td><td>那我就结束这节了，因为鲁伯对我有些恼火。另外，他担心过多的打字会占用你的工作时间。不用我说，这些资料非常有用，而且知识也很少能这么容易获得吧？</td></tr><tr><td>I bid you a fond good evening.</td><td>我向你们致以美好的晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 11:06.Jane said she was strongly dissociated.Seth, she said, let her smoke as much as she wanted to, merely so that it would be easier for him to

coldly going after money, but rather a case of naturally expecting that ability will bring its natural physical constructions, in terms of physical satisfaction.</td><td>这不是漠然地去追求金钱，而是自然地期待，能力会带来其自然的物质建构，在物质的满足方面。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 11:09.Seth had not said too much about the house adventure, so Jane and I were discussing this when he came through again.Again Jane dictated while sitting down.Resume at 11:15.)</td><td>(11:09结束。赛斯没有说太多关于房子探险的事，所以当他再次过来时，珍和我正在讨论此事。珍再次坐下来传述。11:15继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt sensed during your third visit to the house the mood of the people surrounding it.You did also.If you had taken the house you would have moved in on the 13th, and it would have worked out very well, because your expectations would have then built it up.</td><td>在你们第三次去看那栋房子的时候，鲁柏感觉到了周围人的心情。你也是如此。如果你们买下那栋房子，你们会在13号搬进去，结果会很好，因为你们的期)待会建立它。</td></tr><tr><td>I have tried to build your expectations.Before our sessions you would have been satisfied with less.You would have made an excellent go of this.I admit that I tried in some ways to influence you both; but without your acceptance, and practical acceptance, of this idea of owning property and house, and I do mean practical, signature on the dotted line acceptance, you would have gotten nowhere with your desire for a home of your own.</td><td>我试着建立你们的期待。在我们这些课之前，你们满足于本可以更富足的生活。你原本可以在这方面发展得很好。我承认我在某些方面试图影响你们二位，但你们若不接受，而且是实际接受拥有财产和房子的想法，我指的是实际的，签名的接受，那么你们对拥有一个属于自己的家的渴望将会一无所获。</td></tr><tr><td>As for children, I do not consider 15 years old children.Nevertheless, beyond the 13th date, and for psychological reasons, the house will not be available to you.You had to see in concrete terms exactly what your expectations were, and the house represented at that time the height of your expectations, if not the height of your desire.</td><td>至于孩子，我不考虑15岁的孩子。然而，过了13号，由于心理原因，房子将不会提供给你们了。你们必须具体看出你们的期待到底是什么，到了那一天，那房子代表着你们期待的高度，如果还不是你们渴望的高度的话。</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless again, you would have made an excellent project of it; both of you changed your expectations, when faced by them in concrete terms.I will not go into this now.This is a short postscript only.</td><td>然而，同样的，你们本可以做出很好的规划的；当你们具体地面对它们时，你们都改变了自己的期待。我现在不谈这个了。这只是一个简短后记。</td></tr><tr><td>The energy released in the expansion of expectation can be used to advantage in your work, as well as in

but he was early inculcated with the expectation that the outside world meant danger at the least, and tragedy more probably.</td><td>他当然是受到鼓励，还有他母亲的鼓励，去追求内向式的知性自由，某种程度上是如此；但他很早就被灌输了这样一种期待:外面的世界至少意味着危险，更可能意味着悲剧。</td></tr><tr><td>Later circumstances forced him outward, and yet whenever circumstances permit as far as business relationships are concerned, and situations, he will stay where he is.</td><td>后来情况迫使他向外发展，但就业务关系和状况而言，只要情况允许，他就会留在原地。</td></tr><tr><td>Your suggestions this evening were good ones.He is actually more frightened by business relationships than you are, to say the least, even granting that his training is not as specific.As he begins to understand these issues he will expand, as he should in these directions.</td><td>今晚你的建议很好。他实际上比你更害怕商业关系，至少可以这样说，即使他没有受过专业的训练。当他开始理解这些问题时，他将向这些方向扩展，如他本应做的那样。</td></tr><tr><td>This material and other such personal material should be taken as extra bonuses as far as our sessions are concerned.They are more beneficial than you know now.His rather hilarious performance in an unaccustomed social gathering is caused by this fear, and the spectacular aggressive behavior represents an attempt to strike before he is struck.</td><td>就我们这些课来说，这份资料和其他这类个人资料应该被视为额外的福利。它们比你现在知道的更有益。他在一场不习惯的社交聚会中相当滑稽的表现是由这种恐惧引起的，而那惊人的攻击性行为，代表一个先下手为强的企图。</td></tr><tr><td>Selling door to door had to him the subjective advantage in that he was master of the situation, and was indeed the invader.The hapless householder was on the defensive.This will no longer work, and I suggest he not consider it.In his own way he had been brooding.He would like some prestige in terms of position and financial benefit, that earlier did not concern him.</td><td>挨家挨户的推销，对他来说占有主动的优势，因为他是局面的主人，而且确实是个入侵者。那个倒楣的屋主则处于防守状态。这已经行不通了，我建议他不要考虑这么做。他一直在以自己的方式琢磨着。他想要一些在职位和经济利益上的声望，这是他先前所不关心的。</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps you will see how expectations are indeed translated by the individual into concrete reality.Learning is always possible.If this were not so, you would be much more severely limited.These sessions are certainly speeding up your learning process, and they are in themselves naturally the result of your inner expectations.</td><td>也许你会看出，期待是如何真的被个人转化为具体现实的。学习总是可能的。如果不是这样，你们将受到更严重的限制。这些课程肯定会加速你们的学习过程，而它们本身自然是你们内心期待的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>If this were not so, the very possibility of the sessions would not even exist for you.</td><td>如果不是这样，这些课的可能性甚至不会为你们而存在。</td></tr><tr><td>I would like to add a note concerning the importance and dangers of belief.An open mind is by far one of the best advantages that you can possess.Belief is a two way door, although it does not have to be.One belief, for example, may seem to negate another belief.Close examination will often prove this is not the case.Simply for example, a belief in the color red does not negate belief in the color green.</td><td>我想补充一点关于信念的重要性和危险性的说明。到目前为止，开放的心态是你能拥有的最好的优势之一。信念是一扇双向的门，虽然它不一定如此。例如，一种信念似乎可以否定另一种信念。仔细观察后，往往会发现情况并非如此。单纯打个比方，对红色的信念并不否定对绿色的信念。</td></tr><tr><td>When a belief in an abstract term seems to negate another abstract term, it may simply be because your acceptance or expectation is not expansive enough to include both.</td><td>当一个抽象的信念似乎否定了另一个抽象的信念时，这可能只是因为你的接受或期待不够宽泛，不能同时包括这二者。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:28.Jane was dissociated as usual.A rather long break followed, during which we discussed the course her writing should take in the immediate future.The more we talked the less we seemed able to decide;

and when you expect them, the means for them will come.But faith must be shown.</td><td>我知道这下一个建议会遭到你们两位的抗议，因为你们认为这是出于实际的理由。然而，由于你们特殊的体质，小型假期绝对应该成为你们每年生活的一部分；当你们期待它们时，实现它们的方法就会出现。但必须显示出信心。</td></tr><tr><td>In your cases, at the very least one weekend a month should be set aside for sensuous immersion in the patterns of nature, when usual practical considerations are dispensed with.The refreshment will more than make up for, quote, "time lost", unquote.I am not necessarily speaking of extended journeys.The details will be your own, of course.</td><td>以你们的情况，每个月至少应该留出一个周末，去沉浸在大自然的模式中，这时平常的实际考量就放到一边。那份焕然一新将足以弥补"失去的时间"(引号)。我说的不一定是长时间的旅行。当然，细节你们自己安排。</td></tr><tr><td>Actually however, physical extension in space, in terms of even short journeys, will help to expand your psychic and mental horizons, and will help compensate for other freedoms that your house would have provided.</td><td>然而实际上，空间上的物理延伸，即使是短途旅行，也会有助于扩展你们的灵性和精神视野，并有助于弥补你们的房子原本会提供的其他自由。</td></tr><tr><td>I am purposefully giving this kind of material this evening, for my own reasons.Although you are both doing ever so much better, nevertheless you have expended much subconscious energy in the recent past, and not in constructive ways.This loss is much less than the same situation would have caused you in the past.</td><td>今晚我特意提供这种资料，是出于我自己的原因。虽然你们两个都做得越来越好，然而你们在最近的日子里消耗了很多潜意识的能量，而且不是以建设性的方式。这种损失比过去同样的情况会对你们造成的损失要少许多。</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless it has drained you both to some extent.Luckily it will not be at all difficult for you to spring back.Psychically, you are much more resilient now.Another small point.From your small circle of friends you do receive a very beneficial exchange of psychic energies and comprehensions.</td><td>然而，它对你们俩造成了某种程度的耗损。幸运的是，对你们来说，恢复一点都不难。在灵性上，你们现在更有弹性。另一个小提点。从你们小小的朋友圈中，你们的确得到了非常有益的灵性能量和理解的交流。</td></tr><tr><td>This has been lacking with Mark, for one, presently away.It is not Mark, necessarily, only that the unobtrusive but frequent, informal exchange between you and Ruburt and a close friend from the outside world has been lacking.This sort of relationship with someone you both find congenial is a psychic breath of fresh air, in that it provides outlets and psychic interchanges that are extremely important.</td><td>这一点与马克之间一直是欠缺的，目前出远门的那位。不是一定要与马克，只不过，你和鲁伯与外界的亲近朋友之间，缺乏那种不起眼但又经常的非正式交流。这种与你俩都觉得意气相投的人的关系，是一种灵性的清新气息，因为它提供了出口和灵性上的交流，而这种交流是极其重要的。</td></tr><tr><td>I meant to mention this earlier.Of course within bounds, nevertheless a congenial friend or friends represents a basic need for psychic interchange, and even a safety valve for builtup pressures.The psychic interchange is the important aspect.</td><td>我本想早点提到这一点。当然是在限度之内，不过，一位或多位契合的朋友代表了灵性交流的基本需要，甚至是压力积聚时的一个安全阀。灵性的交流是一个重要的面向。</td></tr><tr><td>You will have to strike a balance.Too many influences of this nature would be distracting, but some are definitely necessary; and again now, I would suggest that you invite a few congenial visitors to your home.Telepathically and through the inner senses, you pick up extremely valuable and diversified data in this manner, that is enlightening and helpful to the subconscious, and broadens the psychic base of awareness.</td><td>你们必须取得一种平衡。太多这类性质的影响会让然分心，但有些影响肯定是必要的；现在，我再次建议你们邀请一些相契合的客人到家里来。透过心灵感应和内在感官，你们以这种方式获得极其宝贵和多样化的讯息，这对潜意识有启迪和帮助，并能扩大觉察的灵性基础。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:02.Jane was dissociated as usual.Really out, she said. She resumed in the same manner, again with some pauses, at 10:05.)</td><td>(10:02休息。珍解离如常。她说她真的解离出去了。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not going to hold a regular session this evening, but will end it soon.</td><td>10:05，她以同样的方式继续传述，同样时有停顿。)</td></tr><tr><td>I do have a suggestion, and a suggestion only, for Joseph.Tomorrow afternoon I suggest a long, carefree, refreshing and solitary walk in the afternoon usually devoted to painting time.</td><td>今晚我不打算上正规课，但很快就会结束。我确实有个建议，仅仅是建议，给约瑟。明天下午，我建议在通常用来作画的午后时光，做一个长距离的、安闲自在的、重振活力的独行散步。</td></tr><tr><td>As you walk, become sensuously involved with the trees, landscape in general and colors, and if possible lose yourself in their fragrance and vitality.Breathe deeply physically, let your organism feel its involvement, and complicated intertwining, with the physical environment itself.</td><td>当你散步时，感性地参与到树木、总体的景观和缤纷的色彩中，如果可能的话，让自己沉醉在它们的芬芳与活力中。深呼吸，让你的机体感受到它的参与，以及与物质环境本身的复杂交织。</td></tr><tr><td>This is a most enjoyable and beneficial way of psychic relaxation and renewal.Do not be concerned with physical time.Do not overdo.Come home before you are tired.Forget if possible all personal egotistical considerations, feeling only psychic unity.You will be amazed at how this will help.</td><td>这是一种最令人愉快和有益的灵性放松和更新的方式。不要在意物理时间。不要过度。在疲累之前就回家。如果可能的话，忘掉所有个人的自我考量，只感觉那灵性上的合一。你会惊讶于这对你的帮助有多大。</td></tr><tr><td>This sort of experience is much more practical when used before you are really driven to it, and you are not at that point by any means.Things then will fall into place.There is a psychic give-and-take here that will partly compensate for the present lack of congenial friends.</td><td>在你真正被驱使之前就用到这类经验，那会更加实际，而无论如何，你还没到那个地步。事情将会水到渠成。这里有一种灵性上的施与受，这将部分地弥补)目前缺乏契合的朋友的问题。</td></tr><tr><td>The psychic exchange I have spoken of concerning congenial and fairly regular visitors such as Mark, is subconscious, and you all benefit.Even the regularity, when not overdone, is a strong asset, and in its absence some sort of compensating steps should be taken.</td><td>我所说的关于像马克这样志趣相投的普通访客之灵性交流是潜意识的，你们都会受益。即使是规律性的交流，在不过度的情况下，也是一种强大的资产，在缺乏规律性的情况下，应该采取某种补偿措施。</td></tr><tr><td>While your relationship, that is the relationship between you and Ruburt, is extremely helpful to you both, you have a tendency, each of you, to become ingrown; and psychically you do need a variety, influx and the diversified data subconsciously obtained from others, as you also add to their influx.</td><td>你们的关系，也就是你和鲁柏之间的关系，对你们俩都非常有帮助，但你们有一种倾向，一种向内发展的倾向；心理上，你们确实需要多样性，需要注入，需要潜意识地从别人那里获得多样化的讯息，因为你们也会增加他们的资讯流入量。</td></tr><tr><td>I have no intention of leaving our material on matter up in the air.However this evening's discussion is most timely; since I am sure of you now—</td><td>我不想把我们有关物质的资料吊在半空中。但今晚的讨论很及时；因为我确定你们现在——</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane smiled.)</td><td>(此处珍笑了。)</td></tr><tr><td>—we can afford some personal digressions.Definitely some freedoms must be achieved to compensate for the freedoms that the house would have provided.</td><td>——我们有时间讲点离题的个人私事。一定要有些自由来补偿房子原本可以提供的自由。</td></tr><tr><td>The proximity of the river to your apartment should be utilized.I also suggest that you dispense with psychological time for the remainder of this week.You need now to recharge your batteries so to speak, and this should be most pleasant and enjoyable.As a special favor in this direction, I will end the session.</td><td>河流与你们的公寓距离很近，这应该善加利用。我也建议你们在本周剩下的时间里，停止心理时间的练)习。可以说，你们现在需要养精蓄锐，这应该是最令人愉快和享受的事。作为对这一方面的特别恩惠，我将结束这节课。</td></tr><tr><td>My fond good evening to you both.You are in no danger of a severe depression of any kind.One of the benefits of these personal readings is that I can help you catch yourselves way ahead of time, so to speak, and this is an adventure more important than you realize.</td><td>祝你们两位晚安。你们不会有任何严重抑郁的危险。这些有关个人解读的好处之一是，我可以帮你们早早地提前稳住自己，可以这么说，这是一场冒险，比你们所意识到的更重要。</td></tr><tr><td>Regretfully, I say good evening.</td><td>很遗憾的，我要说晚安了。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth.

All was quiet.She began dictating on time, in a normal voice.Her speech was quite deliberate, and she took many pauses between phrases throughout the session.Her pacing was regular, her eyes dark as usual.)</td><td>(珍在上课前并不紧张，一切都很平静。她准时开始传述，声音正常。她遣词用字相当谨慎，整节课，她在字句之间有很多停顿。她踱步速度适中，眼睛像平常一样黑。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will cover a variety of subjects this evening, beginning perhaps with a short bit of material concerning energy in general.</td><td>我们今晚将述及各种主题，也许从有关一般能量的一小段资料开始。</td></tr><tr><td>No system is a closed system.The framework of all systems is basically infinite.Any appearance of enclosure is the result of camouflage distortions, quite necessary within a given system so that the organisms within it can focus their main attentions to the problems within a particular system.</td><td>没有系统是封闭的系统。所有系统的架构基本上都是无限的。任何看似封闭的外观都是伪装扭曲的结果，这在一个特定的系统中是非常必要的，以便其中的有机体能将其主要的注意力集中在特定系统的问题上。</td></tr><tr><td>(Recently Jane had been reading an essay in which entropy, the mathematical measure of unavailable energy in a thermodynamic system, was discussed.The author of the book postulated closed systems.Yesterday Jane had remarked to me that she did not think Seth would agree, and might have something to say on this, although she did not know when.)</td><td>(最近，珍读了一篇文章，其中讨论了熵，即热力学系统中不可利用的能量的数学测量。那本书的作者做了封闭系统的假设。昨天珍对我说，她不认为赛斯会同意那个假设，并可能对此有话要说，但她不知道会在什么时候谈。)</td></tr><tr><td>Since the outer senses or their equivalent are the main perceptrons of camouflage constructions, then the outer senses and the physical apparatus or its equivalent will habitually perceive its particular system as a closed one.</td><td>既然外在感官或其等同物是伪装建构的主要感知器，那么这些外在感官和物理仪器或其等同物，将习惯性地感知它的特定系统为一个封闭系统。</td></tr><tr><td>The outer senses perceive only certain given distinctions within an open, infinite system, and these distinctions therefore become the apparent boundaries of the system.A closed system is, in other words, the result of the limitations of the outward senses, whose nature it is to distinguish as a meaningful reality only one portion of an open infinite system.</td><td>外在感官在一个开放的、无限的系统中，只感知到某些特定的区别，这些区别，因此成为系统的明显边界。换句话说，一个封闭的系统是外在感官的限制造成的结果，其本质是将开放的无限系统的一部分，区分为有意义的现实。</td></tr><tr><td>The distinctions formed by the outer senses therefore actually limit perception as a whole, while intensifying it into a small but vivid, seemingly enclosed radius of reality.When conceptual thought develops far enough, then it is imagined that all energy originates from what seems to be a closed system; and this misconception then colors all deductions made concerning the nature of energy itself.</td><td>因此，外在感官所形成的区别，实际上限制了对整体的感知，同时将其强化为一个小而生动的、貌似封闭的现实半径。当概念思维发展到一定程度时，就会臆测所有的能量都来自一个似乎是封闭的系统；而这种错误的概念，于是影响了所有与能量本质有关的推)论。</td></tr><tr><td>I repeat that no system, either microscopic or cosmic in size, is ever a closed system.No closed system exists.I will not at this time discuss the deeper issue of one infinite and open system, although this is reality which has indeed theoretically no limitations.Energy completely and constantly does renew itself.</td><td>我重申，任何系统，无论是小至显微镜下或是大至宇宙，都不可能是一个封闭系统。没有封闭的系统存在。我现在不会针对一个无限开放的系统做更深入的讨论，尽管这在理论上，确实是没有极限的实相。能量确实是完全，并不断地更新它自己。</td></tr><tr><td>This may be a poor analogy. However, imagine a small room, a very small room, into which a light Ping-Pong ball has been flung with great force so that it bounces back and forth against the narrow walls.From within the room inhabitants watching would be able, through mathematical deductions, to deduce exactly how long the ball would keep its continuous bouncing activities, at what rate the motion of the ball would lessen, and at what future time the motion would cease entirely.</td><td>这也许是个很差的比喻：然而，想像一个小房间，一个非常小的房间，一个轻巧的乒乓球被用力扔进房间，让它在狭窄的墙壁上来回弹跳。在房间里观察的居民，将能够通过数学推理，准确地推断出球将保持连续的弹跳活动多长时间，球的运动将以何种速度减少，以及在未来什么时候运动将完全停止。</td></tr><tr><td>This would represent a closed system.The calculations would have to be based upon the supposition that the original system somehow had its origin within the room itself.Imagine now that our inhabitants have been hypnotized into believing that they are in a small closed room.Their attention is completely focused within the imaginary room, with the result that all their concepts are based upon that belief.</td><td>这将代表一个封闭系统。计算必须基于这样的假设，即原始系统以某种方式起源于房间本身。想像一下，现在我们的居民已经被催眠，相信他们是在一个封闭的小房间里。他们的注意力完全集中在这个假想的房间里，结果是他们所有的概念都基于这个信念。</td></tr><tr><td>This is the case as far as the idea of a closed system is concerned.All so- called closed systems are caused by a limiting of perception, a narrowing down of distinction, a subconscious agreement that the props are real, and that boundaries exist.Conversely, the boundaries do exist when they are thought to exist.</td><td>就封闭系统的概念而言，情况就是如此。所有所谓的封闭系统都是由感知的限制、区别的缩小、潜意识的认同造成的，即道具是真实的，而边界是存在的。反过来说，当边界被认为存在时，它们就确实存在。</td></tr><tr><td>A cell is not a closed system.An egg, despite all appearances is not a closed system.A skull is not a closed system.</td><td>一个细胞不是一个封闭系统。一颗蛋、尽管表面上看似封闭，但实际上它不是一个封闭的系统。一个头骨也不是一个封闭的系统。</td></tr><tr><td>I will now suggest a brief break.</td><td>我现在建议你们休息片刻。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27. Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed in the same deliberate and quiet manner at 9:37.)</td><td>(9:27，珍像往常一样解离。9:37她又以同样慎重和安静的方式继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>The structure of reality, including all physical phenomena, is composed of mental energy, expanding in terms of psychological value fulfillment.In this sort of reality there can be no closed systems.</td><td>实相的结构，包括所有的物理现象，都是精神能量组成的，以心理上的值的充盈之形式扩展。在这类的实相中，不可能有封闭的系统。</td></tr><tr><td>Mental energy, indeed, is an attribute of personality; but personality survives the physical frame as it existed before the physical frame, and indeed created the physical frame.You can see therefore how unimaginative and basically unworkable the idea of a closed system is.</td><td>精神能量，确实是人格的一个属性；但人格在身体架构之前就已存在，而且在身体架构消亡之后依然存活，人格确实创造了身体架构。因此，你们可以看到)封闭系统的想法是多么缺乏想像力，而且基本上是行不通的。</td></tr><tr><td>A closed system as a concept is also closely intertwined and dependent upon the distortive idea of time as continuity, and the resultant cause and effect premise, which we have already considered earlier.One distortion leads to another.You will learn much more as we continue.</td><td>作为一个概念，封闭系统还与时间持续这个扭曲观念密切相关，以及由之而来的因果前提，这一点先前我们已经考虑过了。一个扭曲导致另一个扭曲。随着我们的继续，你会学到更多。</td></tr><tr><td>An idea, that cannot be scientifically observed in any of your laboratories, definitely exists.An idea is hardly a closed system, but the reality of an idea, its growth and potential, comes much closer to a description of the characteristics of the universe than any current theory.</td><td>一个理念，无法在你们任何实验室中以科学方式被观察到，但它确实存在。一个理念很难是一个封闭系统，但一个理念的实相，它的发展与潜力，比任何当前的理论更接近于对宇宙特征的描述。</td></tr><tr><td>An idea contains in itself an energy that you cannot presently distinguish or measure, an energy transformed into a form unperceived by the outer senses.There is no such thing, basically, as diminishing energy.This again is the result of a concept of a closed system.</td><td>理念本身包含一种你们目前无法区分或测量的能量，一种转化为外部感官无法感知的形态之能量。基本上，不存在逐渐减弱的能量。这又是一个封闭系统概念的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>Psychological vitality is a transformation of energy, again, into terms not recognizable by the outer senses.There are literally countless such manifestations of energy with which the outer senses are not familiar.The inner senses, to the contrary, are well aware of these manifestations, and of the existence of an open infinite system, within which they only are equipped to function.</td><td>心理活力是能量的转化，再次地，转化成外在感官无法识别的表达形式。实际上，有无数这样的能量显化是外在感官不熟悉的。相反，内在感官很清楚这些显化，以及一个开放的无限系统的存在，它们只在这个系统中发挥作用。</td></tr><tr><td>As individual reliance upon the outer senses develops, the personality to a large degree relies upon them, and gradually loses the habit of relying upon the more familiar inner senses utilized mainly in infancy and childhood.This is usually a matter of practicality; yet there are those who continue stubbornly this older and basic reliance upon the inner senses, and these individuals utilize the realization of an open system.</td><td>随着个体对外在感官依赖的逐渐发展，人格也在很大程度上依赖这些外在感官，并逐渐失去依赖更为熟悉的内在感官的习惯，这些内在感官主要在婴儿期和儿童期使用。这通常是一个实用性的问题；但还是有一些人倔强地继续这种对内在感官之古老和基本的依赖，这些个体们采用了对开放系统的领悟。</td></tr><tr><td>You are doing so now.Ruburt is doing so now.Your lack of success lately with psychological time has been to a large measure caused by too great a conscious concentration upon the task.An emotional acceptance, distasteful as this may seem to Ruburt, is the answer here, and again a sensual immersion in the spacious present and in nature will refresh you here.</td><td>你现在正在这样做。鲁伯现在也在这么做。你们最近在心理时间方面缺乏成效，在很大程度上是由于太过有意识地专注于这项任务造成的。情绪上的接受是这里的答案，尽管这在鲁伯看来，可能令人讨厌，再次地，沉浸在广阔的现在和大自然中的感官体验，将使你们重新充满活力。</td></tr><tr><td>The ego and the outer senses reinforce the belief in a closed system, and therefore close it.The inner senses, when the physical body is relaxed, will carry you through the imaginary boundaries, but a conscious focus upon the boundaries to be passed through will tend to reinforce them.Concentrate upon the goal rather than the means of attaining it, and you will attain it.</td><td>自我和外在感官加强了对一个封闭系统的信念，因此封闭了系统。当身体放松时，内在感官会带你穿越想像的界线，但有意识地专注于要穿越的界限，反而有强化那些界线的倾向。专注于目标而不是达到目标的手段，你就会达到目标。</td></tr><tr><td>The results when they are received will appear spontaneous.To say "I am weightless," as Ruburt does, simply reinforces the idea of bulk, and should be discarded.Your vacation will help, and you should really be carefree and relax if possible as children do.</td><td>得到的结果将看起来是自发的。像鲁柏那样，说"我是无重量的"，只会加强了对体积的观念，应该抛掉。你们的假期会有帮助，如果可能的话，你们真的应该像孩子一样无忧无虑地放松。</td></tr><tr><td>You may know that intense immersion into any particular activity results in a momentary loss, or seeming loss, of ego identity, in that the activity and the personality become one.Ruburt becomes his poem during such occasions, and you become your painting.</td><td>你可能知道，极度地沉浸在任何特定的活动中，会一时失去，或似乎失去自我身份，因为活动和人格合为一体。在这种情况下，鲁伯成为他的诗，而你成为你的画。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:01.Jane was dissociated as usual. Again she paused often while delivering the above material.She resumed again in the same fashion at 10:07.)</td><td>(10:01休息。珍像往常一样解离，她在传递上述资料时，经常停顿，10:07她以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>In such a state the personality is free from the limitations of a closed system concept.Identity is not really lost though you may seem to forget yourself, but the props of identity are lost.It is in this same sort of state that the most significant and beneficial inner sense experiments take place.</td><td>在这种状态下，人格摆脱了封闭系统概念的限制。虽然你可能仿佛忘了你自己，但你的本体身份并没有真正失去，是支撑身分的道具丧失了。正是在这种状态下，最重要，和最有益的内在感官体验才会发生。</td></tr><tr><td>You have both experienced such states, both in your work and with your psychological time episodes.You do not know precisely in a conscious manner how to achieve this state when you are working.It seems to just seize you, and disappear.You cannot will it to occur.</td><td>你们都经历过这种状态，无论是在你们的工作中，还是在你们心理时间的场景中。你们在工作时，并不确)切地知道，以有意识的方式，如何达到这种状态。它似乎只是抓住了你，然后消失。你无法用意志让它发生。</td></tr><tr><td>By avoiding distractions you have often, in your work, given it duration.You do not fear such a seeming loss of identity when it involves an immersion of self in idea.You should not fear it either in psychological time experiments.</td><td>借着避免分心，你在工作中经常给它一段持续时间。当涉及到沉浸在想法中的自己时，你并不害怕这种似乎失去本体身份的状态。在心理时间的实验中，你也不应该害怕它。</td></tr><tr><td>While it does appear spontaneously, a good deal of conditioning and expectation is behind it, and your subconscious mind brings it forth.A somewhat similar loss of the props can also be achieved by partial immersion in an idea with which you are already familiar, as a stepping stone; and this is really what Contemplation is.</td><td>虽然它确实是自发出现的，但它背后有大量的调节和期待，而你的潜意识心智将它带了出来。通过部分沉浸于你已经熟悉的理念中，以此作为垫脚石，你也可以达到有点类似的，失掉身分道具的状态；而这才是真正意义上的沉思。</td></tr><tr><td>The idea should be an abstract philosophical concept.This at least, can be done by initial conscious intent.Contemplation of an abstract nature often leads further into valid psychic experience.You may try this for a change of pace.There must always be a balance between necessary conditioning, ritual and habit, and spontaneity, freedom, and what we will call instantaneous psychic relaxations.</td><td>这个想法应该是一个抽象的哲学概念。这至少可以通过最初的有意识的意图来实现。对抽象性质的沉思，往往会进一步导向有效的灵性体验。你可以试试这个，换换口味。必要的调节，仪式和习惯，以及自发性，自由和我们将称之为瞬间的灵性放松之间，必须始终保持平衡。</td></tr><tr><td>Conditioning therefore must also be enlivened, and intuition will help you here.Your physical nature is, as I have told you, an approximation and materialization of inner reality on a physical level.Therefore, such simple activities as walking in the rain, lying upon grass, walking in windy weather, all represent gateways to psychic experience.</td><td>调节作用也必须被激活，直觉在这里会帮助到你。你们身体的本然，如我告诉你们的，是内在实相在物质)层面的一个近似物和具体化。因此，诸如漫步在雨中、躺在草地上、迎风而行等一些简单的活动，都是通往灵性体验的门径。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not minimizing the necessity or power of intellect, but any activity in which the individual momentarily forgets the props of identity, and immerses himself, such an activity allows him to dispense with the practical limitations inherent in a closed system, and refreshes his psychic ability.</td><td>我并不是在贬低智性的必要性或力量，但任何活动，只要能让个人暂时忘却他的身份道具，并沉浸其中，这样的活动就能让他免除封闭系统中固有的实际限制，且刷新他的灵性能力。</td></tr><tr><td>Indeed, your own moments of so-called inspiration in your work, will be seen to follow such periods of immersion, from which the subconscious then acquires its inspiration.Any purposes you would like to achieve should be mentioned to the subconscious before such periods of sensuous immersion or Contemplation, and then forgotten on a conscious level.</td><td>确实，你自己在工作时那所谓的灵感时刻，就将被视为是跟随这种沉浸期，然后潜意识就从中获得灵感。任何你想达到的目的，都应该在这种感性的沉浸，或沉思的时段之前，向潜意识提及，然后在意识层面上忘掉它。</td></tr><tr><td>Too great a conscious focus upon these purposes gives a negative reaction of doubt and anxiety.I am not saying that you should not be at all consciously concerned with your purposes.A reminder to the subconscious as to your purposes, whether they are psychic or practical, will be most helpful before immersion such as a walk, and so forth.</td><td>如果在意识上过于关注这些目的，就会产生怀疑和焦虑的负面反应。我并不是在说，你根本不应该有意识地关注你的目的。在诸如漫步之类的沉浸之前，提醒潜意识你的目的，这会是最有帮助的，无论它们是灵性上的还是实用上的。</td></tr><tr><td>Now.Sensual immersion implies dropping momentarily the barriers between the ego and what the ego is enjoying.This should be simple enough to follow, and the information given this evening will be of much value.</td><td>现在。感性的沉浸，意味着暂时放下自我，和自我正在享受的事物之间的障碍。这应该很容易做到，今晚所给的讯息将很有价值。</td></tr><tr><td>The spontaneity of psychic experience cannot be stressed too strongly, and you will find it again following these directions I have given you.They represent the second step, as the initial experiments in psychological time represented the first.</td><td>灵性体验的自发性，再怎么强调都不为过，按照我给你们的这些指导，你们会再度找到它。它们代表了第二步，而心理时间的初步实验代表着第一步。</td></tr><tr><td>They should be taken up again, and alternated with the above directions, according to your development.</td><td>心理时间的实验应该再度着手，并根据你们的进展与上述的指导交替进行。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.Or because I have been lenient lately, you may end the session if you prefer.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。或者因为我最近一直很宽厚，如果你们想的话，也可以结束课程。</td></tr><tr><td>("No."</td><td>("不想"。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:35.Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed in the same manner at 10:45.)</td><td>(10:35休息。珍像往常一样解离，10:45她用同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>This is one of the main reasons why I suggested as a rule, at least one day if not two, a month, spent away from the familiar apartment props, and in short trips.The details are not important and need not cost much expense.</td><td>这就是为什么我建议作为一项惯例，每个月至少有一两天离开你们熟悉的公寓，去做个短途旅行的原因之一。细节并不重要，也不需要花费太多。</td></tr><tr><td>If a car were not available even long walks through various parts of town, with say lunch in various strange dining places, would do.Traveling itself with the change of environment, and with the right attitude, tends to ease and facilitate psychic transformations.If traveling is carried out also with the immersion into enjoyment of which I have spoken, then the benefits are twofold.</td><td>如果没有车的话，就行走到村镇的各个角落，比方说到不同的陌生餐厅午餐，也是可以的。旅行本身与环境的变化，再加上正确的态度，往往会纾解和便捷灵性的转换。如果在旅行的同时，还能沉浸在我所说的享受中，那么好处是双重的。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt should not work less at his writing than four hours daily, and when possible perhaps a few hours over the weekend.You should attempt also four hours a day.Subconsciously, everything you do adds to experience that you will use in your work.</td><td>鲁伯每天的写作时间不应少于四小时，如果可能的话，周末也应写上几个小时。你也应该试试每天用4个小时画画。潜意识地，你所做的一切都会增益你在工作中会用到的经验。</td></tr><tr><td>This has been an excellent session.Nevertheless even the vacation from me will do you good.My most fond friends, I bid you a pleasant good evening.</td><td>这一节很精彩。然而，即使是来自于我的休假，也会对你们有好处。我最喜爱的朋友，祝你们有个非常愉快的夜晚。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Spontaneous attempts, rather spontaneous sessions on your own, may be beneficial if they are not overdone.I will not say more on this, this evening.</td><td>自发的尝试，而不是你们自发的课程，如果不过度的话，可能是有益处的。今晚对这一点，我就不再多说了。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 10:56.Jane was dissociated as usual.My writing hand felt no fatigue.)</td><td>(10:56结束。珍像往常一样解离。我写字的手不觉得累。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 79</td><td>第79节心理单元,熵,坡屋的期待</td></tr><tr><td>AUGUST 12, 1964 9 PM WEDNESDAY AS SCHEDULED</td><td>1964年8月12日星期三晚上9点定期课</td></tr><tr><td>(Tues. 8/11, 8:15 PM, I tried the technique of immersion as discussed by Seth in the 78th session.I tried mentally contemplating the brick wall in Ed Robbins fireplace at his home in New Paltz, N.Y. It seemed to work.I soon achieved a feeling of elevation and pulsation in my left side, including my left hand and foot.For a time the left hand also felt as though it were lifting out of itself in a doubled-up position.I believe I might have achieved more, but was interrupted by the singing of a mosquito in my ear.</td><td>(8月11日，星期二，晚上8:15，我尝试赛斯在第78节课上谈到的沉浸技术。我试着在心理上沉思埃德-罗宾斯在纽约州新帕尔茨家中的砖墙。它似乎起了作用。我的左侧，包括我的左手和左脚，很快就有了上升和脉动的感觉。有那么一会儿，还感觉到左手似乎从自己手上擡了起来，重叠在自己的手上。我相信我可以做到更多，但是被耳边蚊子的嗡嗡叫声给打断了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Wed. 8/12, 8:12 PM, I made an attempt at Contemplation while sitting up but did not achieve anything beyond a slight sensation in my left hand.</td><td>(8月12日，星期三，晚上8:12，我尝试在坐着的时候凝神沉思，但除了左手有轻微的感觉外，没有取得任何成果。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane has also been trying Contemplation, and has observed the beginnings of a few achievements, after a long period without success in psychological time.</td><td>(珍也在尝试冥想，并观察到一些成就的苗头，在心理时间的练习上，有很长一段时间都没有成效。</td></tr><tr><td>(It will be recalled that in the 63rd session, page 159, Seth gave us an August 12. 15 date for Miss Callahan.That period, signifying what we do not know, begins today.I mentioned it to Jane this morning, but had no plans to ask Seth about it tonight.</td><td>(想起在第63节，赛斯曾给了我们一个和卡拉汉小)姐有关的日子，8月12日，15日。那个时段就从今天开始，标示着我们不知道的事情。今早我向珍提)及，但没打算今晚向赛斯询问这件事。</td></tr><tr><td>(Both of us slept until 8:40 this evening.

Again, her voice was quiet and deliberate, and she used many pauses.By contrast, her pacing was quite rapid at the beginning of the session, and remained so until near the end.Her eyes darkened as usual.)</td><td>(今晚，我们俩都睡到了8:40，珍课前并不觉得紧张，又一次直到9：01才开始传述，同样的，她的声音轻细且慎重，有很多停顿。相比之下，她踱步的速度在课程开始时相当快，并一直保持到接近结尾。她的眼睛像往常一样变黑了。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>This will be our last session before your well-earned vacation.</td><td>这是你们应得的假期之前的最后一节课。</td></tr><tr><td>If your scientists realize that ideas themselves, and any such phenomena, were composed of definite energy, then they would realize that energy does not diminish.</td><td>如果你们的科学家意识到，理念本身以及任何此类现象，是由明确的能量组成的，那么他们就会了悟到能量不会减弱。</td></tr><tr><td>The psychological frameworks behind physical reality are also composed of energy, and are the building blocks that I have mentioned earlier.Their expansion is not limited by any of your known, or misinterpreted, laws of space or time or thermodynamics, since they exist in a dimension where such laws simply do not apply.</td><td>在物质实相背后的心理架构也是由能量组成的，是我先前提到的构建模块。它们的扩张不受任何你们已知的，或被曲解的，空间或时间或热力学定律的限制，因为这样的定律，在它们所存在的维度中根本不适用。</td></tr><tr><td>Your scientific principles have been formulated either through direct interpretation of matter as perceived through the outer senses, or formulated indirectly but in accordance with such perception.They cannot therefore be thought to apply to dimensions unperceived by the outer senses.Energy then expands in terms of value fulfillment, in the way that I have explained in past sessions.</td><td>你们的科学原理，要么是通过直接解释由外在感官感知而来的事物制定的，要么是为了符合那样的感知而间接制定的。因此，它们不能被认为适用于外在感官未感知到的维度。所以说，能量以值的充盈(valuefulfillment)的形式扩展，以我在过去的课程中所解释过的方式。</td></tr><tr><td>Present methods cannot investigate this type of expansion any more than they can investigate the validity, development, and rate of expansion of an idea.</td><td>目前的方法无法探究这种类型的扩展，就像无法探究一个理念的有效性、发展和扩张率一样。</td></tr><tr><td>This cannot be stressed too strongly.As it happens, ideas do vary in their energy structure.There are basic laws that can be applied, as far as the expansion rate of idea is concerned.Present scientific methods will not discover such laws, however.</td><td>这一点再怎么强调都不为过。正如它所发生的那样，理念在其能量结构上确实有所不同。就理念的扩张率而言，有一些基本规律可以应用。然而，目前的科学方法不会发现这种规律。</td></tr><tr><td>The power of idea-thrust can also be actually measured, but not in terms that you can now understand, and resistance rates theoretically can be measured.In the past I spoke briefly of pulsations, as atoms and molecules were transformed from one energy plane to another, becoming visible to the material field.Such pulsations, expansions and contractions also operate as far as energy in the psychological structure is concerned.</td><td>理念推力(idea-thrust)的力道也可以实际测量，但不是以你们现在可以理解的方式，而且阻力率在理论上也可以测量。过去我曾简要地谈到过脉动，当原子和分子从一个能量层面转化到另一个层面时，它在物质场域中变得可见。就心理结构中的能量而言，这种脉动、扩张和收缩也在运作。</td></tr><tr><td>They of course have their results or effects on psychological levels, representing what we may call psychological personality thrust.This does not apply only to the reality of human personality, but to that basic inner and smallest unit, individual prime consciousness that is at the core of any psychic gestalt.That is, the smallest unit of individual consciousness which finds physical fulfillment in the formation of matter.</td><td>当然，它们在心理层面上有其结果或影响，代表我们可以称之为心理人格的推力。这不仅适用于人类人格的实相，也适用于那个基本的内在最小单元，即个体的初始意识，这是任何灵性完形的核心。也就是，个体意识的最小单元，在物质的组成中找到了实质的履行。</td></tr><tr><td>This smallest psychological unit represents the minimum individual psychic component, the most basic personality building block, from which other more complicated psychic structures are formed.</td><td>这个最小的心理单元代表了最低限度的个体灵性成分，最基本的人格构建模块，其他更复杂的灵性结构都是由它所组成。</td></tr><tr><td>This unit could be compared, then, to a molecule on the purely physical level.It is composed of individualized psychic energy, capable of amassing about itself only a minimum of physical materialization; and yet it is extremely necessary, for it is a first stepping stone of psychological energy into the physical field.</td><td>那么，这个单元可以比作纯物质层面的分子。它是由个体化的灵性能量所组成，只能够为自己积累最低限度的实质物质化；但它又是极其必要的，因为它是心理能量进入物质场域的第一块垫脚石。</td></tr><tr><td>It represents also the minimum thrust value necessary for physical transformation of energy from a purely psychological into a physical state.It represents, then, the minimum expansion needed to overcome physical resistance. It represents the minimum psychological expectation necessary for construction.</td><td>它也代表了能量从纯粹的心理状态转化为物质状态所必需的最低推力值。那么，它代表了克服物理阻力所需的最小扩展，它代表了建构所需的最低心理期待。</td></tr><tr><td>It is self-propelled, self-perpetuating as a psychological energy unit.It will indeed materialize itself upon the physical plane simultaneously and withdraw itself simultaneously, as I have explained earlier.Your time sense gives it and all matter the appearance of durability.</td><td>作为一个心理能量单元，它是自我推进、自我延续的。正如我先前解释过的，它真的会在物质层面具体化自己，并同时撤回自己，你们的时间感给了它以及所有物质那持久的外观。组成那最小或任何物质单元的能量，在外在感官不再能感知到它的地方穿过物质场域。有些，而且是大量的能量，穿越过物质场域，使你根本无法感知到它，采取你无法区分的形态，而且也无法在物质层面上加以利用。这就是你们的科学家想出熵这个想法之处。</td></tr><tr><td>The energy that composes the smallest or any physical unit, passes through the physical field where the outer senses can no longer perceive it. Some, and a large amount, of this energy passes through the physical field so that you do not perceive it at all, taking form that you do not distinguish, and that cannot be harnessed on the physical level. And this is where your scientists get the idea of entropy.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>(9:35休息。珍像往常一样解离，9:41，她以同样方式继续传述，停顿频繁，步履快速。)</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:35. Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed in the same quite manner, with frequent pauses and her fast pacing, at 9:41.)</td><td>未在一个层次上利用的能量，会在另一个不同的层次被使用到。所有的能量基本上都是自我激活的，但在不同的电磁场中，需要不同的能量潜力以便有效利用。</td></tr><tr><td>Energy not utilized upon one level is simply utilized on a different level. All energy is basically self-activating, but different energy potentials are required for effective utilization in various electromagnetic fields.</td><td>理念，本身由能量所组成，被转换或转化成其他类型的能量，在许多情况下，你恰好能感知到这些能量。</td></tr><tr><td>Ideas, being themselves composed of energy, are translated or transformed into other kinds of energy, which you happen in many instances to perceive. On other planes the idea energy is perceived, and the energy transformed into physical fields is not perceived.</td><td>在其他层面上，理念能量被感知到，而转化为物质场的能量则不被感知。</td></tr><tr><td>Psychological energy units smaller or weaker than the minimum unit required for physical construction, simply pass through the physical field unperceived and unconstructed.They do, however, exert some, though inconsequential, effect which theoretically could also be measured, and which would account for some of the energy considered diminished, and help to account for the entropy theory.</td><td>小于，或弱于物质建构所需之最小单元的心理能量单元，仅仅是穿越物质场域而不被感知，也不被构建。然而，它们确实施加了一些影响，虽然不太重要，理论上也可以测量，这将解释一些被认为是减弱的能量并有助于解释熵理论。</td></tr><tr><td>This material is highly relevant.Theoretically the laws governing the psychological energy structures could be worked out mathematically, but until it is realized that energy is basically mental and psychological in nature and origin, little can be done.</td><td>这份资料有高度的相关性。从理论上讲，统辖心理能量建构的法则可以用数学方法计算出来，但直到能认识到能量的本质和起源基本上是精神和心理的，否则几乎无能为力，毫无办法。</td></tr><tr><td>A simple example can be seen in the transformation of an idea into a painting, that is the transformation of the energy, the psychological energy of an idea into physical materialization.The idea itself, once you have conceived of it, represents an additional energy component that you build up, formulate and manipulate on the psychological level, and then transform; but the idea itself contains energy.</td><td>在一个理念想法转变为画的简单例子中可以看到，那就是能量的转化，是理念的心理能量转化成实质的显化。一旦你构思了这个理念，这个理念本身就代表了一个额外的能量成分，你在心理层次上建立、制定和操纵，然后转化；但这个理念本身就蕴含着能量。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not only speaking therefore of the obvious energy that you as a personality and physical structure use in the activity of transforming the idea. Ideas themselves then, being composed of energy, give additional energy to the psychological, physical structure that conceives and manipulates them.</td><td>所以，我说的不仅仅是你作为一个人格和身体结构在转化理念的活动中使用的明显能量，因此，理念本身，作为能量的组成，也给构思与操纵它们的心理与身体建构带来额外的能量。</td></tr><tr><td>The idea has an energy potential based upon the innate energy potential of its creator.You are dealing now with what may be thought of as energy envelopes, and this is a most valid description of all realities.Continued experience in conceiving ideas and manipulating them and transforming them actually adds to the available energy of the individual.</td><td>理念有能量潜力，这基于其创造者先天的能量潜力。你现在面对的是可以被想作"能量封套"(energyenvelopes)的东西，这是对所有实相之最有效的描述。在构思、操纵和转化理念方面的持续经验，实际上增加了个人的可用能量。</td></tr><tr><td>I cannot repeat too often the fact that I speak of the actual energy content of idea, as separate and additional to the energy obviously utilized in transforming idea from the psychological to the physical field.</td><td>我要不厌其烦地强调我说的这个事实:理念的实际能量内含，与明显用在将理念从心理场域转化为物质场域的能量是分开的，是额外的。</td></tr><tr><td>Here I suggest a brief break, as the nature of the material requires it.</td><td>我建议在此休息一下，因为资料的性质需要这样。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:04.Jane was dissociated as usual.My writing hand felt no fatigue.The nature of the material to follow will reveal the subject of our discussion at break.When she resumed, Jane's voice changed to fit the subject, as it often does during delivery.</td><td>(10:04休息。珍像往常一样解离。我写字的手不觉得累。休息时，后续资料的性质将揭示我们在休息时讨论的主题。当珍重新开始时，她的声音随着话题而变)化，就像她在传述时经常做的那样。</td></tr><tr><td>(For the first part of this session, her delivery had been very deliberate and businesslike, almost as though personalities involved were rather unimportant. As soon as personalities became involved in the material however, Jane’s voice became quite amused, and displayed many humorous inflections.Resume at 10:14, with no more pauses.)</td><td>(在这节的第一部分，她的传述一直是非常慎重，公事公办，几乎就像所涉及的人格不太重要，然而，一旦人格介入到资料时，珍的声音就变得相当顽皮有趣，还有许多幽默的语调。10:14继续，不再有停)顿。)</td></tr><tr><td>A small remark here, in line with your discussion during break.Our good Ruburt has amazed his new director by his sudden bubbling good spirits, and bewildering exuberance.</td><td>根据你们在休息时的讨论，我在这里做个小小的评论。我们的好鲁柏，用他突然冒出的大好心情和莫名其妙的欢快阳光，让他的新主管大吃一惊。</td></tr><tr><td>He is so different in his attitude as to appear to be two completely different people.The director is afraid to hope that this will last.He needs strongly to feel that he is liked.His affectations are for the purpose of building up an image that he believes must be superior enough to be respected.If he is not going to be liked, he is determined to be respected.</td><td>他的态度如此不同，似乎是两个完全不同的人。这位主管不敢奢望这种情况能持续下去。他非常需要感觉到他是被人喜爱的。他的装腔作势是为了建立一个他认为必须足够优越才能受到尊重的形象。如果他不被人喜爱，那么他就决心要被人尊敬。</td></tr><tr><td>His powerful basic insecurity was caused by a broken home, and a situation where he was also thrown into alien cultures; not only was he unsure of belonging to a family, but also felt he had no cultural or national belongings.</td><td>他的强烈根本的不安全感，是由破碎的家庭造成的，以及他同时也被抛入异域文化的境况；他不仅不确定是否属于一个家庭，而且还觉得自己没有文化的或国家的归属感。</td></tr><tr><td>A conflict as to sexual requirements developed, as various qualifications were held for the sexes in the countries in which he lived.This adds to the insecurity.My advice for once, out of desperation, was followed by Ruburt, with results that you know.</td><td>在他住过的那些国家里，由于各种资格都是针对性别而设的，这对性别的要求形成了冲突。这更增加了他的不安全感。我这么一次迫不得已的建议，被鲁伯采纳了，结果你是知道的。</td></tr><tr><td>The man does have touches of brilliance.He exaggerates his brilliance out of nagging doubts of his merit.Nevertheless, one of the basic keys to his character is the overwhelming need to be liked as a human being.</td><td>这个男人确实有几分才华横溢。他夸大自己的才华，是出于对自己可取之处的挥之不去的质疑。然而，他性格上的基本关键之一是，作为一个人，他渴望被人喜欢。</td></tr><tr><td>Now a note concerning the way that expectation controls the manner in which an individual utilizes and manipulates the energy of idea.</td><td>现在，关于期待控制个体利用和操纵理念能量的方式之说明。</td></tr><tr><td>We will take the personality of your director, Ruburt, if we may.Here not only desire but expectation brought about his directorship. He wanted, and finally expected, some kind of domain of his own.Being a part of no real community as a youngster, being unsure even of family unit, he first sought out various organizational positions, and governmental environments, as a man might wrap a cloak about him to protect himself from the elements.</td><td>如果可以的话，鲁柏，我们就来谈谈你新主管的人格。在这里，不仅是渴望，而且是期待，带来了他的主管职位，他想要，并最终期待有某种属于自己的领地。作为一个年轻人，他没有加入过真正意义上的社群，甚至对是否属于一个家庭成员都不确定，他先是寻求各种机构和政府单位的职位，就像一个人可能用斗篷裹住自己，以保护自己免受风吹雨打。</td></tr><tr><td>So he attempted to wrap himself in the cloak of organization.He remained however basically anonymous.His desire to belong and his expectation also became stronger.The gallery represents a unit of community affiliation in which he can exert some power, and yet be within a community unit.</td><td>所以，他试图用机构团体的外衣来包裹自己。然而，他基本上仍然是无名的。他对归属感的渴望和期待也变得更加强烈。画廊代表了一个隶属于社群的单位，在其中，他可以行使一些权力，但又在一个社群单位内。</td></tr><tr><td>His aggressiveness against community structures will be used constructively, in an attempt to mold the structure to his own conception of what is good, and yet force the community as a whole to recognize him as someone with whom it must deal.</td><td>他对抗社群组织的霸气将被建设性地使用，他企图塑造这个组织以实践他认为是好的理念，同时又迫使整个社群把他认做非得与之打交道的人。</td></tr><tr><td>There are times when expectation suddenly shifts.It has been in the process of changing, but it suddenly shows the change as it suddenly becomes obvious through physical construction.When it finally manages to change constructions, bringing them into line with present alterations, the individual realizes that something has happened.</td><td>有的时候，期待会突然转移。它一直处于变化过程中，当它突然透过物质建构变得明显时，改变就突然显示出来。当它最终设法改变建构，使其与目前的改动相一致时，个体就会意识到有些事情发生了。</td></tr><tr><td>An example, dear friends, is your house.</td><td>亲爱的朋友，你们的房子就是一个例子。</td></tr><tr><td>You would have moved into it on the 13th.Ruburt, mainly, worked out the problem psychologically, actually living in the house in the psychological field.Her—and I say her advisedly, since here Ruburt operated as a woman—her disappointment was instant but superficial.</td><td>你们原本会在13号搬进去的。鲁柏主要是在心理上把问题解决了，并真的住进了那栋房子的心理领域里。她——我故意说她，因为鲁柏在这里是以一个女人在运作着。她的失望是即刻的，但却是表面的。</td></tr><tr><td>The letter had little to do with your joint decision not to buy.Both of you decided no before the letter arrived, and you caused the letter.Your energy focused on the property, constructed the property into the state where the road disintegrated into a trail.</td><td>那封信和你们不买房子的共同决定没有什么关系。你们两个在信寄来之前就已决定不买了，是你们导致了那封信。你们的能量聚焦在那个房产上，把房产建构成了道路破败成小路的状态。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane perched on the back of the couch as she talked, and remained there for some time.She spoke very earnestly, using many gestures.It might be added that the letter referred to above was one received from the regional office of the Veterans Administration, in N. Y.C.: The letter characterized the dirt road leading up to the property as a "trail, ’’and stated the request for a loan was denied unless the veteran, meaning myself, could be assured that the road would be maintained by either city or county at no additional expense to the veteran.This could not be done, since at this time the road is classed as private, and must be maintained by whoever lives on the property.)</td><td>(现在，珍边说边倚在沙发的靠背上，在那里停了好一会儿。她说得很认真，用了很多手势。可以补充的是，上面提到的那封信，是从纽约州退伍军人管理局的区域办公室寄来的：信中把通往该房产的土路描述为"小路"，并表示拒绝贷款请求，除非退伍军人(指我本人)能够确保该路将由市或县维护，不会给退伍军人带来额外开销。这件事办不到，因为目前这条道路被列为私人道路，必须由住在该地产的人维护。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. You found that you wanted more when it came down to it than the property seemed to offer.You did not expect that you could get what you found you wanted at the price.You constructed the property, then, in terms of what you expected you could get for the price, and then did not consider this sufficient.</td><td>现在，你们发现你们想要的，比该栋房产似乎能提供的还要多。你们并不指望，以那样的价钱，能得到你们想要的房产。于是，你们用你们预期以那个价位能买到的房产，建构了该房产，然后认为这是不够的。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I tried, ineffectively I might add, in the sessions to raise your expectations of the property for the same price, by justifiably showing you, I thought, how value fulfillment psychically could definitely add to the construction.</td><td>现在，我也许可以这么说，我试着在几节课里，提高你们对相同价位的房产的期待，我用我认为很合理地的方式，向你们展示，灵性上的值的充盈(valuefulfillment)可以如何确切地增益建构，但徒劳无功。</td></tr><tr><td>Had I succeeded, the transaction would have been an excellent one.Your expectations did rise.In this I did succeed.But practically, you could not leap the boundary, you could not expect to get so much (in parenthesis: the added expectations) for so little.You therefore ripped down the construction to meet the price, and then refused it.</td><td>如果我成功了，这将会是一个很棒的交易。你们的期待的确提高了。在这一点上我确实成功了。但现实上，你们无法越过那个界线，你们无法期待能得到物超所值的东西(插入圆括号：增加的期待)。因此你们就撕裂了那个建构，以符合它的价位，然后再拒绝它。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you want a break?</td><td>你们想要休息吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane stared at me from her perch on the couch.</td><td>(珍从沙发那头盯着我。</td></tr><tr><td>("No. ")</td><td>("不用。")</td></tr><tr><td>I wanted to give you this material earlier, but found it more advantageous to wait.The offered bank loan represented your inner realization of what had occurred, offering really another chance that you were not able to take.</td><td>我本来想早点给你们这个资料，但发现等待一下更有利。银行可以提供的贷款，代表了你们内心对所发生的事情的认识，它确实提供了另一个机会，但你们没有能够抓住。</td></tr><tr><td>(This may be, but the bank loan offered Jane and me was quite a bit more expensive, and we did not feel we wanted to take on the added expense.It included borrowing to meet the down payment—a double mortgage, so to speak, and we wanted none of this.)</td><td>(可能是这样，但是提供给珍和我的银行贷款更贵一些，我们不想负担那额外的费用。它包括借钱来支付)头期款——可以说是双重抵押。而我们不想这样。)</td></tr><tr><td>This is not meant in any way as any sort of reprimand, but merely as an example close at hand as to how expectation operates.Ruburt’s disappointment then, was only superficial, because he knew that the decision had been made much earlier.The assessor, then, with his own free will of course in operation, nevertheless saw the property as you had constructed it.I will certainly not expect you at this point to believe me literally—</td><td>这并不意味着任何形式的斥责，而只是作为一个近在手边的例子，说明期待是如何运作的。所以，鲁柏的失望只是表面的，因为他知道，这是早就决定好了的；那个评估员当然是照他自己的自由意志行动，但仍然看到了你们所建构的房产。我当然不指望你们此时真的会相信我说的话——</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane had left the couch, and now she rapped on the table before me for emphasis.)</td><td>(珍离开了沙发，现在，她敲打着我面前的桌子以示强调。</td></tr><tr><td>-nevertheless, you could have maintained that road mentally with little difficulty.</td><td>——尽管如此，你可以在精神上维护这条道路，毫无困难。</td></tr><tr><td>(It might be worth noting here that the property was appraised by an assessor from Ithaca, NY, rather than one from Elmira.As it happened, at the time all three of the Veterans Administration appraisers who are based in Elmira were out of town on vacation; therefore the bank in Elmira had to call in a representative from out of town to evaluate the property—and one who had never seen the property before.Jane and I have speculated as to what the assessors report might have stated had it been compiled by a local man familiar with the property.)</td><td>(这里可能值得注意的是，该房产是由来自纽约州伊萨卡的评估员评估的，而不是来自艾尔迈拉的评估员。当时，退伍军人管理局在艾尔迈拉的三名评估员都出城度假；因此，艾尔迈拉的银行不得不从城外叫来一名代表来评估该房产，而且是一名从未见过该房产的代表。珍和我猜测，如果评估员的报告是由熟悉该房产的当地人写的，那么报告可能会有什么内)容。)</td></tr><tr><td>The heat problem of which Ruburt learned, was the result of expectations on the part of the previous tenants, and need not (underline need) have concerned you.It goes without saying that your expectations have been transformed into reality, and the house now would not be practical, unless of course your own expectations changed drastically.</td><td>鲁柏发现的暖气问题，是前住户的期待造成的，你们不需要(下划线)担心的。不用说，你们的期待已经转化为实相，那栋房子现在已不符合你们的实际需求，当然，除非你们自己的期待发生了巨大的变化。</td></tr><tr><td>Incidentally, as you may have noticed, your expectations instead have changed as far as your apartment is concerned.They had to.Expectations then will always bring about a definite change, not only in your attitude toward matter, but in matter itself.</td><td>顺便说一下，可能已经注意到，你们对公寓的期待反而发生了改变。它们必须改变。期待总是会带来明确的改变，不仅是在你们对事物的态度上，而且在事物本身。</td></tr><tr><td>This must always be taken into consideration.</td><td>这一点必须始终被列入考虑。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane laughed.She was now sitting across the table from me as she dictated.This session is one of the very few in which she has been off her feet for any length of time at all.)</td><td>(珍大笑。她现在坐在我对面传述。这是少数几次中的一次，在一段时间中没有到处走来走去。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will not keep you longer.I might suggest that you expect to have an excellent vacation.A small additional note: When you are away, give a thought now and then to your cat. It will keep him healthier, in your absence.</td><td>我不会占用你们太长时间。或许我会建议你们期待一个非常棒的假期。一个小的补充说明：当你们不在的)时候，要时不时地想想你们的猫，这样牠在你们不在的时候，才会比较健康。</td></tr><tr><td>I bid you both a fond good evening, and while we will not have regular sessions, I will be with you during your travels, if Ruburt will allow me.Bon voyage.</td><td>我向你们俩道声晚安，在我们没有定期课的期间，如果鲁柏允许，我会在你们旅行的时候陪着你们。一路平安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth. "</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 10:55.Jane was dissociated as usual.Still sitting across the table from me, she remarked that if Seth had promised, earlier, to maintain the road to the house for us, she would have gone through with the deal.I jokingly answered that if Seth had done something about the traffic noise rolling up the mountainside, I would have gone through with the purchase.Jane then resumed dictation at 10:56, sitting where she was.)</td><td>(10:55结束。珍像往常一样解离。她仍然坐在我桌子的对面，她说，如果赛斯早一点向我们保证，只要维修那条路就能保有那栋房子，她就会完成这个交易。我开玩笑地回答，如果赛斯能对山腰上传来的交通噪音做点什么的话，我就去把那栋房子买下来。珍随后在10:56恢复传述，坐在原处。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your decision not to buy occurred the first time that you heard the traffic, and Ruburt's occurred when the children took his precious berries.If looks could kill, the children would have died on the spot.</td><td>你不买的决定，发生在你第一次听到交通噪音的时候，而鲁伯的决定，发生在孩子们摘了她宝贝浆果的时候。如果眼神可以杀人，那些孩子会当场暴毙。</td></tr><tr><td>The fact remains that the low price bothered you, and as a result you became sensitive to the sound of traffic, looking for a way to justify the low price, as did Ruburt.This, despite your frown, is a fact.And now, dear friends, good evening once more.</td><td>事实是，那个价钱低到让你不安，因此你对交通的声音变得敏感，寻找一种方法来证明低价的合理性，就像鲁伯一样。尽管你皱起了眉头，但事实就是这样，亲爱的朋友。再说一次，晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(I had been laughing, and frowning too.Neither of us, consciously, had been bothered by the price of the house.We had thought we offered a fair price, one within what we could afford to pay.</td><td>(我一直在笑，也在皱着眉头。在意识上，我们两个对房子的价格，都不觉得有什么不对劲。我们认为我们提出了一个合理的价钱，而且是我们负担得起的价格。</td></tr><tr><td>(My writing hand was now very tired for the last part of the session had been quite fast.Jane told me that Seth was still with us.I had a question to ask, but hesitated to voice it until she finally surrendered with a laugh.It was simply whether the heating system, which I had accepted without alarm as being okay would have performed better for us than the previous tenant.After the deal had fallen through, Jane accidentally heard that the heating bills in winter were exorbitant—about twice what we had been led to expect.If so, they would have made the house too expensive for us.</td><td>(我写字的手现在很累了，因为这最后一段传述非常快。珍告诉我，赛斯还在我们这里。我有个问题要问，但迟疑着没有说出口，直到她最后笑着投降。我只是想问问，那个我毫无警戒地接受的暖气系统，认为它没有问题，比起前一个租户，对我们是否会运作得要好一些。在交易失败后，珍无意中听说冬天的供暖费用非常高——大约是我们预期的两倍。如果是那样的话，那栋房子的花费对我们来说就太高了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane then resumed again as she sat opposite me.She had, again, been dissociated while delivering the last brief material.Resume now at 11:05.)</td><td>(然后珍就坐在我对面，又重新开始了。在最后这简短的传述中，她又解离了。11:05继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>The rather slaphappy, haphazard attitude of the other residents on that road is actually more effective in maintaining it, since they do not dwell upon its disadvantages but simply and purely expect the road to be passable.</td><td>那条路上的其他住户，他们那种随意而无虑的态度，实际上对维护那条路更为有效，因为他们不会纠结于)它的缺点，而只是单纯地指望那条路还能通行就好了。</td></tr><tr><td>They do not, however, expect more of it.The road will be in better condition when three families use it than when it is used only by two.If you lived there and dwelled upon its imperfections, you could have ruined it for everyone.</td><td>不过，他们对那条路并没有更多的期待。当三个家庭使用它时，道路的状况会比只有两个家庭使用它时好。如果你们住在那里，还老是想着它的不完善之处，你们可能替所有人把那条路给毁了。</td></tr><tr><td>With the present heating system, high expectations would have increased its efficiency.Low expectations would have decreased its efficiency.Your fear of commitment was indeed an element here.You have both steadily doubted your practical efficiency in a material universe, and you will continue to do so, for with your present attitudes you will not test your efficiency.Or if you dare test it, your fears will defeat you, and only serve to convince you further of this inefficiency.</td><td>至于现有的暖气系统，高度的期待会提高它的功效。期待低则会降低它的功效。你们对承诺的恐惧才是最重要的因素。你们都一直怀疑自己在物质宇宙中的实际效用，而且你们会继续这样怀疑，因为以你们现在的心态，你们不会去测试自己的效用如何。就算你们敢，你们的恐惧也会打败你们，并且只会让你们进一步相信这种低效。</td></tr><tr><td>Your

this end, seemingly, to his mind could be achieved in no other more ordinary way.

This room is part of a cottage that is joined to another cottage in the crowded Provincetown area, and both units are, actually, directly in back of a business establishment that faces on Provincetown’s main street, Commercial St. To reach them it’s necessary to use an alley around the business establishment.To explain the rather complicated setup, Bill drew a map for Jane and me, and my copy of it is included with these notes.</td><td>(据了解，拉里-奥图尔在夏天租了"海滩对面的字体房"。这间房是一间小屋的一部分，小屋与另一间小屋相连，位于拥挤的普罗温斯顿地区，实际上，这两间房都在一家店铺的后面，店铺正对着普罗温斯顿的主要大街，一条商业街。要到小屋去，必须穿过这家店铺的走廊。为了解释这复杂的环境，比尔为珍和我画了一张地图，我把地图的副本放在这些笔记中。</td></tr><tr><td>(To leave the cottages for a moment, down the street within three blocks is a bar with a large keg in it, as Seth stated.Thus, the locale described in the session encompasses a relatively small physical area.The name of the bar is the Atlantic House, and Bill states that it actually is made up of several smaller bars, each featuring a different decor.In one of these smaller bars is a very large keg, which had been cut in half, each half is set into a wall, forming a striking display.</td><td>(离开小屋不到3个路口的地方有一间酒吧，里面有个大酒桶，就像赛斯说的那样。因此，在那节中描述的地点包含了一个相对较小的区域。那个酒吧的名字叫"大西洋之家"，比尔说它实际上是由好几家小酒吧组成的，每间酒吧都有不同的装饰。其中一个较小的酒吧里，有一个非常大的酒桶，它被切成两半，每一半都被镶嵌在墙上，形成一个引人注目的展示。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill states that on or somewhere either just before or after July 29, the date of the 75th session, he attended a party at Larry O’Toole’s cottage.Attending the party were Bill, Gary, Larry, and two other men Bill did not know.Thus, as Seth stated, Bill "was in a group with four men. "</td><td>(比尔说，大约在7月29日前后，也就是第75节上课的那一天，他参加了拉里·奥图尔小屋的一个派对。参加派对的有比尔、加里、拉里·奥图尔和另外两名比尔不认识的男子。如此一来，正如赛斯所说，比尔"和四个人在一个小组"。</td></tr><tr><td>(The party broke up rather early that evening, and Bill then went to the Atlantic House bar with Garry and Larry, where he saw the keg.Bill states that another bar in Provincetown has many small kegs dangling from the ceiling as a means of decoration, but these kegs are quite small, and do not compare with the one in the A-House for size.</td><td>(那天晚上，派对很早就散了，然后，比尔和拉里奥图尔去了大西洋之家酒吧，在那里看见大酒桶。比尔说，在普罗温斯顿还有另一间酒吧，把很多小酒桶吊在天花板上当装饰，但那些酒桶都很小，完全不能和大西洋之家的那一个相比。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill states it is his belief that the "two houses nearby" do refer to the two cottages mentioned above, one shared by Gary and Larry O’Toole, with the font room across from the beach, since they are not far down the street from the A-House bar.</td><td>(比尔说，他认为"附近的两栋房子"确实是指上面提到的两栋小屋，其中一栋是加里和拉里-奥图尔合住的，字体房在海滩对面，因为它们离大西洋之家酒吧不远。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill Macdonnel also states that as one looks out the front room of Larry O’Toole's cottage, he sees just to the left a dock with boats, although Seth stated it as "a boat and dock, ’’singular.To the right of the joined cottages is the Provincetown Playhouse.</td><td>(比尔·麦克唐纳还说，他从拉里·奥图尔小屋的前厅望出去时，看见左边有一个码头，码头停了一些船，不过赛斯说的是"一艘小船和码头"，单数。在双拼小屋的右边是普罗温斯顿剧院。</td></tr><tr><td>(The front room overlooking the water is, contrary to expectations, rather an unusual one in Provincetown, Bill said, since the cottages are rather crowded in against other building in somewhat of a helter-skelter fashion, and actually most of them do not command a view of the water.In this O’Toole's cottage was out of the ordinary.The bar in the cottage has a small beer keg, Bill said, but he does not believe this is the one referred to by Seth.</td><td>(比尔说，与他的预期相反，眺望水面的前厅在普罗温斯顿是相当不寻常的，因为这个双拼小屋紧临着其他各种杂乱的建筑物，所以这些建筑物大部分都看不到什么海景。在这一点上，奥图尔的小屋是与众不同的。比尔说，小屋的吧台有一个小啤酒桶，但他不认为这就是赛斯所说的那个。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill has [by coincidence?] made a painting of the general area described above, and I will photograph it for the record.</td><td>(比尔对上述的大致区域画了一幅图[巧合吗？]，我会把它拍下来当作记录。</td></tr><tr><td>(Regarding Seth's statement about a string of shells, the only association with shells that Bill recalls is that shell ashtrays were used at the party.He does not think this is what Seth referred to.</td><td>(至于赛斯所说的一串贝壳，比尔记得唯一与贝壳有关的是，在派对上使用了贝壳烟灰缸。他不认为这是赛斯所说的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Let it be stated that neither Jane nor I have ever been to Provincetown, anywhere on the Cape.I spent one day in Boston about 23 years ago while in the service, on my way to an airfield in Maine by train.</td><td>(声明一下，珍和我都没去过普罗温斯顿。大约23年前，我在服役期间在波士顿待了一天，当时我正乘火车去缅因州的一个机场。</td></tr><tr><td>(It might also be noted that Bill was a witness to the 68th session, but not of course the 75th.At the 68th session, Bill, Jane and I made tentative plans to experiment at set times for telepathic communication while Bill was at the Cape, but these plans did not materialize.)</td><td>(还可以指出的是，比尔是第68节课的见证人，当然)不是第75节的。在第68节课上，比尔，珍和我初步计划，在当比尔在科德角的时候，我们要在约定的时间进行心灵感应的实验，但这些计划都没有实现。)</td></tr><tr><td>(For the record:I copied Bill Macdonnel’s map of the Provincetown area discussed in the 82nd Session.)</td><td>(作为记录。我复制了比尔-麦克唐纳在第82届课上讨论的普罗温斯顿地区的地图。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 83</td><td>第83节弗洛伊德,荣格,凯西</td></tr><tr><td>AUGUST 31, 1964 9 PM MONDAY AS SCHEDULED</td><td>1964年8月31日星期一晚上9点定期课</td></tr><tr><td>(Continuing the story of narcotics in Elmira as predicted by Seth in the 63rd session, June 17, 1964, there was published in the Elmira paper for Saturday, Aug. 29, the story of the arrest of an addict connected with the theft of a doctor’s bag and prescription blanks at an Elmira hospital parking lot.

Her pacing was rather slow, her eyes dark as usual.Her cold was much better, incidentally.)</td><td>(在今晚的课程之前，我向珍提到，我希望赛斯能讨论8月12日，15日，他针对卡拉汉小姐而给出的日期，还希望他会提到比尔对他的预言情况的报告。珍不知道这一节课的主题，不过她预计课程会很短。她准时开始传述，声音正常，踱步速度相当缓慢，她的眼睛和往常一样黑。顺带一提，她的感冒好多了。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>This will be a short session.</td><td>这将是一节短课。</td></tr><tr><td>When we have an unexpected or unscheduled session, I will always endeavor to shorten the succeeding session, as in this case.</td><td>当我们有一个意外的，或未安排的课时，我总是努力缩短接下来的那节课，就像这一次的情况。</td></tr><tr><td>We will, indeed, return to our discussion of the inner senses.However there is more material concerning the nature of matter which should be considered first.</td><td>事实上，我们将回到我们对内在感官的讨论。然而有更多关于物质本质的资料应该首先考虑。</td></tr><tr><td>There are a few points that I would like to make of a general nature.Ruburt has been reading Jung, though not consistently.The libido does not originate in the individual subconscious of the present personality.It originates instead in the energy of the entity and inner self, and is directed by means of the inner senses, outward so to speak, through the deeper layers of the individual subconscious mind, then through the outer or personal layers.</td><td>有几点我想说的是一般性的。鲁柏一直在读荣格的书，虽然不是持续地读。性驱力(libido)不是源自于当前人格的个人潜意识。相反，它起源于存有和内在自己的能量，经由内在感官，引导向外，可以这么说，经过个人潜意识心智的更深层，然后再到外在或者说是个人的层次。(libido译注：性驱力是荣格与弗洛伊德的理论。也称为性冲动、性欲，是一种力量。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your Freud and Jung have probed into the outer, personal subconscious.Jung saw glimpses of other depths, but that is all.There are rather unfortunate distortions occurring in Jung's writings, as well as in Freud’s, since they did not understand the primary, cooperative nature of the libido.We will involve ourselves in a much more thorough study along these lines, as we come to another body of subject material.</td><td>你们的弗洛伊德和荣格探索了表层的，个人的潜意识。荣格瞥见了其他深处，但仅此而已。在荣格的着)作中有相当令人遗憾的扭曲现象，在弗洛伊德的著作中也是如此，因为他们不了解性驱力原生的，合作的本质。进入另一个主题内容的资料时，我们会在这些议题上做更加详尽的探讨。</td></tr><tr><td>However, the basic cooperative nature of the libido is indeed responsible, in large degree, for the psychic cooperation in which all entities are involved, in the construction of a physical world of matter that is inhabited by all on your plane.</td><td>然而，性驱力的基本合作本质，确实在很大程度上对所有存有都参与的灵性合作负责，在构建一个由你们层面所有生灵都居住其间的物质世界的过程中。</td></tr><tr><td>This cooperative nature of the libido has been completely overlooked and misinterpreted for various reasons, many simply due to ignorance.You know that the individual cells of any form cooperate to form another, more complicated gestalt; and without the cooperation not only would the more complicated structure cease to operate, but the individual cells would also cease to operate.</td><td>性驱力的这种合作本质由于各种原因而被完全忽视和误解，其中许多原因只是因为无知。你们知道，任何形式的单个细胞都会合作形成另一个更复杂的完形；如果没有合作，不仅更复杂的建构会停止运作，而且单个细胞也会停止运作。</td></tr><tr><td>We have spoken of the interdependence and cooperation, biologically, among organisms in your physical universe.The new appearance of an individual into the physical realm is aided by the psychic cooperation of individuals on your plane.Almost at once the new libido takes up its adopted duty of maintaining the physical universe, along with all others, and without hesitancy.</td><td>我们已经谈到了在你们物质宇宙中，有机体之间在生物学上的相互依存与合作。一个新个体在物质领域的出现，是得到了你们层面上个体的灵性合作的协助。几乎在一瞬间，新的性驱力就承担起它的责任，与其他的所有生灵一起，毫不犹豫地维护起物质宇宙。</td></tr><tr><td>If it did not do so it would not exist for long.Cooperation on all levels is the necessity on all planes.</td><td>如果它不这样做，它就不会长期存在。各个层次)(level)的合作在所有层面(plane)都是必要的。</td></tr><tr><td>The cooperation can be joyous, given freely on subconscious and conscious levels, or it can be given in a grudging manner, but it will be given.</td><td>这种合作可以是快乐的，在潜意识和意识层面上自由地给予，也可以以一种勉强的方式给予，但一定会被给予。</td></tr><tr><td>I would like to mention a bit concerning your friend, Mark.</td><td>我想提一下关于你的朋友，马克。</td></tr><tr><td>(It will be recalled that Mark is the name of Bill Macdonnel’s entity.)</td><td>(还记得，马克是比尔·麦克唐纳存有的名字。)</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt blocked some of the material, but did let a significant portion through.The four men and the room overlooking the water that I mentioned, did refer to the men and the room Mark told you of.I did, however, see outside that night also a boat with a symbol on its bow, and this boat I had mentioned earlier.The boat was tied to a pier, and was the first in line as you looked out from the room.</td><td>鲁柏挡掉了一些资料，但还是让很大一部分的资料传了过来。我提到的那四个男人和眺望水面的房间，的确指的是马克告诉你们的那几个人和那个房间。然而，那晚我确实看到外面有一艘船，船头有一个标志，这艘船我之前提到过。船是系在码头上，从房间里看出去，它是排在第一的那艘船。</td></tr><tr><td>(Remember that Seth did mention a boat in both the 68th and 75th sessions.</td><td>(记得赛斯确实在第68节和第75节课都提到一艘船。</td></tr><tr><td>("Did Bill see it?’)</td><td>("比尔看到那艘船了吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>I saw it.He should have seen it from that viewpoint.He may not remember.The bar did refer to the bar a few blocks away with a large keg in it, rather than any other bar, many of which were decorated with small kegs.</td><td>我看到了。从他的视线看过去，他应该看到。他可能不记得了。那个酒吧的确指的是几条街外的那家，有着大酒桶的那间，而不是其他的酒吧，很多酒吧都是用小酒桶装饰的。</td></tr><tr><td>Miss Callahan, on the 14th of August, merely suffered a very light stroke. I say merely, since the occurrence could have been of an even more severe nature.On the following day she was more mentally agitated than usual, dizzy, with some motor disability in the left arm.The condition, the mental condition, passed more or less unnoticed in the light of her known disabilities.</td><td>卡拉汉小姐在8月14日那一天，只是遭受了一次非常轻微的中风，我说只是，因为情况可能会更严重。第二天，她比平时更焦躁不安、头昏，左手臂不太能动。鉴于她已有的行动障碍，她的状况，她精神的状况，或多或少没有被注意到。</td></tr><tr><td>Had she seen a doctor on the 14th the condition would have been noticed, I believe.</td><td>如果她在14日看了医生，我相信这状况会被注意到。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:29. Jane was dissociated as usual. She gave the information on Miss Callahan while pacing back and forth with her left hand to her forehead, as though in deep thought. At break she said she had not been aware that she was doing so.Jane resumed in the same manner at 9:35.)</td><td>(9:29休息，珍像往常一样解离，她一边提供关于卡拉汉小姐的信息，一边用左手扶着额头来回踱步，似乎在深思，休息时，她说，她没意识到自己在这样做。9:35她以同样的方式继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>I told you that this will be a short session, and so it will.I do suggest that on session nights Ruburt find some time to relax.Also that whenever possible you both read our material, and that you do continue now with psychological time, following the directions which I have given you.</td><td>我告诉过你们，这将是一节短课，所以它会是一节短课。我确实建议鲁柏在上课的晚上，找时间先放松一下。另外，只要有可能，你们俩都要读我们的资料，而且要按照我给你们的指示，继续做心理时间的实验。</td></tr><tr><td>Do not think, either, that I have forgotten to discuss your previous experiences, for I have not.They will be discussed under their own headings when the time is ready.</td><td>也不要以为我忘了讨论你们先前的经验，因为我没忘。当时机成熟时，它们将在各自的标题下拿出来讨论。</td></tr><tr><td>I will not bother to make any comments on your lack of decision in following my suggestion during our unscheduled session, nor upon Ruburt's change of position at the gallery.I suppose however, that in the last instance congratulations are in order, and so I make them.</td><td>对于你们不照我在临时课上的建议做决定，以及鲁柏在画廊的职位更动之事，我就不费心评论了。不过我想，既已至此，应该祝贺你们，所以我祝贺俩位。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Seth refers to the fact that Jane has been made Assistant Director at the art gallery.She is very pleased.Her duties have been changed somewhat, and will include lecturing to the children’s classes on art history; Jane likes to teach, and many sessions ago Seth said this ability was a carryover from a previous life, and was so far not being used in this life.)</td><td>(这里赛斯指的是，珍在画廊当了助理主管的事。她非常高兴。她的职责有些改变，将包括为儿童班讲授艺术史；珍喜欢教学，在很多节课之前，赛斯说这个能力是前世遗留下来的，到目前为止还没有在这一世用到过。)</td></tr><tr><td>I was concerned somewhat with Ruburt's reading of Jung, simply because while he seems to offer more than Freud, in some aspects he has attempted much, and his distortions are fairly important, in that seeming to delve further and offering many significant results, he nevertheless causes insidious conclusions.All the more hampering because of his scope.</td><td>我有点担心鲁伯对荣格的解读，只是因为虽然他似乎比弗洛伊德提供了更多，在某些方面，他尝试了很多，他的扭曲是相当重要的，从那一点看来，似乎是在进一步深入研究，并提供许多重大成果，但他还是造成了隐性的有害结论。由于他知见的范围，更多的反而是阻碍。</td></tr><tr><td>I will discuss this further at a later date, and in its place.</td><td>过一段时间，我会以其立场，进一步讨论这个问题。</td></tr><tr><td>I will never endeavor to put any pressure upon you, through needling you to following my suggestions, and I understand very well, believe it or not, the so-called practical aspects of the world in which you live.Nevertheless I certainly can register some disappointment, and so I do.</td><td>我绝不会努力对你们施加任何压力，催促你们照我的建议去做，而且，无论你信不信，我对于你们所处的世界的所谓实际面向非常理解。然而我当然可以表达一些失望，所以我表达了。</td></tr><tr><td>Also since you have both been reading the Cayce book, I have a few comments.Our material speaks for itself, and many of Mr. Cayce's comments are extremely valid and should be helpful to you.He outlined, as you know, some of the dangers in undisciplined dabbling with the subconscious, and I have also hinted that certainly some could, and did, exist, which is why we have progressed slowly and surely, in a disciplined manner.</td><td>还有，既然你们两个都在读凯西的书(译注:Cayce，埃德加·凯西，美国著名的通灵家，曾被称为沉睡的先知；也是珍与罗用通灵板第一位呼叫的灵。)，我有几点意见。我们的资料就是它自己最好的声明，而凯西先生的话是极有根据的，应该对你们有帮助。如你们所知，他概述了无纪律地涉足潜意识的一些危险，我也暗示过，当然有一些可能，而且确实存在，这就是为什么我们以一种有纪律的方式缓慢而坚定地前进。</td></tr><tr><td>We are bringing all aspects into balance this way.Ruburt’s personality has held itself in excellent bonds, being flexible, and it is this flexibility that is extremely important.It is this flexibility, in both of your personality patterns, that gives us needed strength and balance, and I am speaking now of a subconscious flexibility, basic to your personalities.</td><td>我们正在通过这种方式使各方面达到平衡。鲁柏的人格一直保持着极好的结合，很灵活，而正是这种灵活性是最重要的。正是这个在你俩人格模式中的灵活性，给了我们需要的力道和平衡，我现在说的是一种潜意识的灵活性，是你们人格的根基。</td></tr><tr><td>A rigid personality pattern, held tightly in a vice of shall we say extremely immobile, subconscious psychosis, is unable to find release through healthy channels, and cannot arise into the mobile world of creation.</td><td>一个僵化的人格模式，紧抓着可以说是极不稳定的，潜意识的精神病态不放，是无法通过健康的渠道找到释放，也无法出现在流动的创造世界中。</td></tr><tr><td>Anything rigid breaks easily when any new pressures are applied.Therefore, when such a rigid, psychotic personality suddenly discovers a way for release through opening the subconscious, then the rigid rock at its core explodes into a lava of uncontrollable fantasy; and the terror at the base of such a personality is then externalized, and the individual forced to face under the worst possible conditions, those personal disruptions buried for so long.</td><td>刚者易折，经受不起任何新增的压力。因此，当这样一个僵化的、精神错乱的人格(psychoticpersonality)，突然发现通过打开潜意识来释放的方法时，这硬块就会从核心炸开，爆发出无法控制的幻想熔岩；这样一个人格的底层恐怖会被外化，而这个体被迫在最坏的情况下去面对那些深埋已久的人格混乱。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:59.Jane was dissociated as usual.She resumed in the same quiet manner at 10:02.)</td><td>(9:59休息。珍像往常一样解离，10:02她以同样安静的方式恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will not keep you much longer.</td><td>我不会耽误你们太长时间。</td></tr><tr><td>I wanted to state that whatever personal neuroses you both have, and everyone has some, you are certainly no exception, these because of the fluidity and flexibility of your subconscious makeups, have been rather efficiently used through sublimation in your own creative activities.</td><td>我想说的是，无论你们两个有什么样的精神障碍)(neuroses)，每个人或多或少都有一些，你们当然也不例外，这些由于你们潜意识构成的流动性和灵活性，通过升华在你们自己的创造性活动中得到了相当有效的利用。</td></tr><tr><td>It is for this reason that our progress has been smooth, and yet steady.Nor was, nor should, my well-meaning suggestion be taken, as Ruburt at least once mentioned, as any sort of temptation to him to retreat from the outer world.</td><td>正是由于这个原因，我们的进展一直很顺利，但也很稳定。我善意的建议，还没有，也不应该，被作为促使他从外界撤离的任何形式的诱因，如鲁伯至少曾经提到的那样。</td></tr><tr><td>I had also intended, if the suggestion were followed, to add certain suggestions having to do with the necessity of seeing others, and even of some aggressive activities, so to speak, which would have effectively counteracted any possible tendency for withdrawal on his part.</td><td>如果这个建议被采纳的话，我还打算再加上一些建议，这些建议涉及到与他人交往的必要性，甚至可以说是一些积极的活动，这将有效地抵消他任何可能的退缩倾向。</td></tr><tr><td>You will never find me advocating a withdrawal from the outer world, advocating prejudice of any kind, advocating any activities that will be in any way injurious to health, or advocating a fanaticism, ever, on the part of the sessions themselves.</td><td>你会发现，在课程本身的部分，我永远不会主张从外部世界退缩，主张任何形式的偏见，主张任何以任何方式损害健康的活动，或主张狂热主义，从来没有。</td></tr><tr><td>Commitment yes, fanatic commitment no.I certainly advocate that the body of the material be made available to the public, and indeed its purpose is to help mankind understand himself, so that he may understand the world which mirrors his inner reality.</td><td>要承诺，但不要狂热的承诺。我当然主张把资料的正文向公众开放，确实，它的目的是帮助人类了解他自己，以便他能明白，这个世界反映了他的内在实相。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not and never will, set Ruburt up or you up, Joseph, as any kind of superior beings, sacred in any way that all men and women are not sacred.If you and Ruburt have certain abilities to perceive, receive, translate and communicate that which some others cannot, many also have other abilities that neither of you do have.</td><td>我不是，也永远不会，把鲁柏或你，约瑟，塑造成任何一种优越的存在，在任何方面都是其他男女所没有的神圣。如果你和鲁柏有某些能够感知、接收、转译和沟通的能力，那些其他人无法做到的能力，那么也有许多人拥有你们没有的其他能力。</td></tr><tr><td>I will never on the other hand insist upon a groveling humility, a feeling of uselessness, for upon such a false and inadequate conception of self is based the most unfortunate sort of exterior posturing.I insist upon an honest, humble and proud acceptance of your own relationship with the universe, and an acceptance of your responsibility in it.</td><td>另一方面，我绝不会坚持一种卑躬屈膝的谦卑、一种无用的感觉，因为这是最遗憾的表面姿态，是建立在如此错误和不充分的自己的概念上的。我坚持诚实、谦虚和自豪地接受你自己与宇宙的关系，同时接受你在其中的责任。</td></tr><tr><td>With these precepts no one can find fault.It is true that the outward manifestations of the libido are directed toward the physical world, but until the source of the libido is seen and studied and known to exist, not in the topmost subconscious layers of the individual, and not even in the racial subconscious, but within the entity itself, then man will not know himself.</td><td>没有人能够对这些原则挑到毛病。诚然，性驱力的向外显化是朝向物质世界的，但除非看到，研究并知道性驱力源头的存在，否则，人将不会认识他自己，性驱力源头不是在个体的最顶层的潜意识里，甚至不是)在种族潜意识里，而是在存有自身之内。</td></tr><tr><td>Jung feared, basically, such a journey because he felt that it led only to the racial source.He feared that anyone involved in such a study would end up in the bottleneck of a first womb; but there, there is an opening-up into other realms, through which the libido also passed.Figuratively speaking, it squeezed itself through the bottleneck, and there is a lack of limitation on the other side.</td><td>荣格基本上害怕这样的旅程，因为他觉得这只会通向种族来源。他怕所有这样的研究，最终会陷入初始子宫的瓶颈；但是那里，有一个进入其他领域的开口，性驱力也穿越那个开口。形像地说，它把自己挤过了瓶颈，而在另一边的领域是没有限制的。</td></tr><tr><td>Freud courageously - into the individual topmost layers of the subconscious, and found them deeper than even he suspected.These levels are indeed filled with what may be termed lifegiving and death-tempting differentiated and undifferentiated impulses acquired in the present life of an individual.But when these have been passed there are many discoveries still to be made.</td><td>弗洛伊德勇敢地──进入了个体潜意识的最上层，发现它们远比他猜测的还要深。这些潜意识层确实充满了个体在今世获得的所谓赐予生命和死亡诱惑之有区别和无区别的冲动。这些冲动是个体在今世获得的。不过在通过这些之后，还有很多有待发现。</td></tr><tr><td>When these have been passed then the diligent, consistent, intuitive and flexible seeker after knowledge will find horizons of which Freud never dreamed.Freud merely touched the outer boundaries. Jung, with his eyes clouded by the turmoil set up by Freud, glimpsed some further regions, but poorly.</td><td>当这些都通过后，那勤奋的，始终如一的，直觉的和灵活的求知者将发现弗洛伊德从未梦想过的地平线。弗洛伊德只触及了外部边界，荣格用他被弗洛伊德设定的混乱所笼罩的双眼，瞥见了更远的疆域，但看得很模糊。</td></tr><tr><td>What Freud did for the personal layers of the subconscious we and others like us must do for the furthest reaches.</td><td>弗洛伊德在个人潜意识层所做的研究，我们和其他像我们一样的人，必须再把它延伸到最远的地方。</td></tr><tr><td>Are your hands tired?</td><td>你的手累了吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(My writing hand was beginning to tire, yet I did not want to pause, so answered in the negative.</td><td>(我写字的手开始累了，但我不想停顿，所以回答是否定。</td></tr><tr><td>("No.")</td><td>("不累"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Here you will discover man’s true origins, and the mechanisms and ways in which the unseen self operates, forms his universe of matter through psychic energy, and communicates on levels unperceived by his outer physical organism.</td><td>在这里，你会发现人类的真正起源，以及那看不见的自己之运作的机制和方式、通过灵性能量组成他的物质宇宙，并在他外部物质有机体感知不到的层次间进行交流。</td></tr><tr><td>You see, or man sees, not even half of the whole entity which is himself.It is true that in this journey and on this search, discipline, some caution and understanding, and much courage, is demanded.</td><td>你看到的，或人们看到的自己，甚至连他自己整体存有的一半都不到。的确，在这个旅程和探索中，需要纪律、一些谨慎和理解，以及很大的勇气。</td></tr><tr><td>This is as it should be.I am helping you in this, and others like me.It is because so much hodgepodge has emerged that a disciplined and consistent investigation of this sort, on your parts, is necessary.You are both peculiarly suited for such pursuit, with a combination of intuitiveness, basic psychic facility, and yet integrated inner identities.</td><td>它理应如此。我在这方面正帮着你，还有其他像我这样的。正是因为出现了如此多的大杂烩，所以对你们来说，这种有纪律的、一致性的调查是必要的。你们两个具有直觉力，基本的灵性能力，和整合的内在本体身分，特别适合做这样的追寻。</td></tr><tr><td>This is extremely important.I suggest a break.The session will be over by eleven.</td><td>这非常重要。我建议休息一下。这节将在11点前结束。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:37.Jane was dissociated as usual.She said she had been reading Jung lately, though very desultorily and not at all avidly.She resumed dictation in the same quiet manner at 10:40.)</td><td>(10:37休息。珍像往常一样解离。她说她最近一直在读荣格的书，但只是懒散地看看，一点都不热切。10:40她以同样平静的方式恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>I also want to add that I am not a control, as mediums speak of having a control.I am not, as I believe I have mentioned, a secondary or split personality of Ruburt’s.For example, I am not a conglomeration of male tendencies that have collected themselves into a subsidiary personality that struggles for recognition or release.</td><td>我还想补充一点，我不是一个控制者，如灵媒所说的有一个控制者。我相信我已经提过，我不是鲁伯的次要人格或分裂人格。例如，我不是一个男性倾向的集合体，将自己集合成一个为获得承认或释放而奋斗的附属人格。</td></tr><tr><td>I am certainly not a conglomeration of vaguely-defined creative aspects of Ruburt’s personality, that struggle for release.Ruburt’s own array of writings, published and unpublished, should testify that he needs no added creative outlet.</td><td>我当然不是鲁伯的人格中那定义模糊的创造性面向的集合体，挣扎着寻求释放。鲁伯自己的一系列著作，不管是已出版的还是未出版的，都应该证明他不需要额外的创作渠道。</td></tr><tr><td>We operate on a cooperative basis, and will continue to do so.I suggest that this material be sent with letters or other portions of the material, to whatever sources you have in mind.I say that I am an energy personality essence, since that is what I am.</td><td>我们在合作的基础上运作，也将继续这样合作。我建议将这份资料连带信件，或资料的其他部分一起寄给你所想到的任何资源。我说我是一个能量型人格精髓，因为那就是我。</td></tr><tr><td>There is no invasion of Ruburt’s mind or subconscious on my part.He allows us to communicate.My name for him is Ruburt, which happens to be a male name simply because the name is the closest translation, in your terms, for the name of the whole self or entity, of which he is now a self-conscious part.</td><td>我并没有侵入鲁柏的心智或潜意识。他允许我们进行交流。鲁柏是我给他的名字，这恰好是一个男性的名字，只因为这个名字，用你们的话来说，是他的整体自己或存有名字的最接近的翻译，他现在是他存有之自觉意识的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>There is no danger of either so-called (in quotes) "unhealthy or evil or demon, or uncontrolled spirits," (end of quote), finding access to the door in the subconscious which Ruburt has opened.Such demons, as a rule when they seem to—</td><td>没有所谓的(加引号)"不良的或邪恶的或魔鬼的，或不受控制的灵"(引号结束)的危险存在，寻找进入鲁柏打开的潜意识之门的机会。那样的恶魔，通常在它们似乎——</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane pounded upon the table for emphasis.)</td><td>(这时珍重重地敲了敲桌子以示强调。)</td></tr><tr><td>-suddenly burst forth, have long been hiding in the personal subconscious, and are indeed unfortunate creations of a psychotic mind.There are none of these in Ruburt’s subconscious mind.</td><td>——忽然爆发出来的时候，它们长期以来一直隐藏在个人的潜意识中，而且确实是精神混乱的心智的不幸创造物。在鲁柏的潜意识心智里并没有这些。</td></tr><tr><td>Luckily, and this applies to both of you, any unhealthy aspects of strong subconscious formation find access through your own creative works.The closed and dangerous subconscious is that one which is closed both to inner depths of inspiration arising from the inner self, and also to outer doors of expression.</td><td>幸运的是，这适用于你们两人，任何强烈的潜意识形成的不健康面向，都能透过你们自己的创作找到出口。封闭而危险的潜意识，是指既封闭了来自内心深处的灵感，也封闭了外部表达的大门。</td></tr><tr><td>Here the pressure is explosive, but this applies to neither of your cases.Therefore, we have no invasion of Ruburt’s personality on my part, as I have said.It will be shown that personalities continue to exist after physical death, and then it will not seem so strange that those such as myself can communicate.</td><td>这里的压力是爆炸性的，但这并不适用于你们的情况。因此，如我所说的，我们没有侵入鲁伯的人格。这将表明人格在肉体死亡后继续存在，然后像我这样的人格能够交流就不会显得那么奇怪了。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not some creepy spirit, to wiggle my ears at the first suggestion for applause, for parties or for your pleasure.Not that you have asked me to do so, but for the record.I am not a spirit in those sentimental terms spoken by some well-meaning but poorly balanced mentalities.</td><td>我不是什么令人毛骨悚然的灵，一有建议就扭动我的耳朵，以博得掌声，参加派对或取悦你们。不是说你要求我这样做，而是为了记录。我不是那些好意但心态不平衡的人，用感性的话语所形容的那种灵。</td></tr><tr><td>I am an energy personality essence.Your inner sense of identity, and Ruburt's, is strong.You have no need to even wonder about the possibility of any sort of invasion, that would be detrimental.And any invasion would be detrimental.</td><td>我是一个能量型人格精髓。你内在的本体身份感，以及鲁伯的本体身份感，都很强。你们甚至没有必要怀疑任何形式的入侵的可能性，那将是有害的。而任何入侵都是有害的。</td></tr><tr><td>I wanted all of this material together, so that a concise statement of our positions, and of the purpose of this material, could be made.And now, after keeping you longer than I intended, I bid you a most fond good evening.</td><td>我想把所有这些资料放在一起，以便对我们的立场和这份资料的目的做一个简明的说明。我原本没有打算耽搁你们这么久，现在，在耽误了你们这么长的时间之后，我向你们道一声最美好的晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth.

She expected it to be short. She began dictation in a voice somewhat louder than usual.Her pacing was regular, her eyes dark as usual.)</td><td>(珍在课前并不紧张，她预计这一节会很短，她今天传述的声音比平常略大。她踱步正常，眼睛和平时一样黑。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth."’)</td><td>("晚安，赛斯。")</td></tr><tr><td>With your consent I will now begin the session.Even in the face of your exhaustion; and for your edification I shall indeed make it brief.</td><td>在你们的同意下，我现在要开始上课了。即使在你们这么疲惫的情况下；为了你们的启发，我会讲得简短些。</td></tr><tr><td>My welcome to Mark, who is with us again, and I repeat: The boat was the first boat in vision from the inside of the large room in which the men met.</td><td>我欢迎马克，他又和我们在一起了，我再重复一遍：那艘船是从举行派对的大房间往外看，进入视野的第一艘船。</td></tr><tr><td>(See page 322. We had discussed with Bill the additional information Seth gave in the last session concerning the boat with a symbol on it, supposedly visible to Bill from this particular seaside room in Provincetown, but Bill is not able to recall the craft in question.Seth had also mentioned this boat in the 68th and 75th sessions.)</td><td>(见第83节，我们曾与比尔讨论过赛斯提到的一艘船上面有个符号的事，从普罗温斯顿的那个房间应该可以看到那艘船，但是比尔无法想起有那么一艘船。赛斯在第68和第75节课，也提到了这艘小船。)</td></tr><tr><td>I saw the boat plainly, when I took in the whole scene.Perhaps Mark was not aware of seeing it.</td><td>当我看进整个画面时，我清楚地看到了那艘船。也许马克没有意识到看到它。</td></tr><tr><td>("What was the symbol on it?")</td><td>("它上面的符号是什么？")</td></tr><tr><td>The symbol was a half arc with one crossed line diagonally, almost like an inverted cent sign—c - e - n - t. It was not large.There may have been an initial "J" beside it, and a second initial "F" or "W".</td><td>那个符号是一个半弧形，上面有一条斜线交叉，几乎像一个倒置的美分符号--c-e-n-t(￠)，它不是很大。在它旁边可能有一个首字母"J"，以及第二个首字母"F"或"W"。</td></tr><tr><td>I have nothing else to add, beside what was given in the previous session regarding Marks journeys.</td><td>除了上一节关于马克之旅的内容外，我没有其他补充。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, also I have said nothing about Ruburt's change in status at the gallery, for my own reasons.And it will do you no good to ask me what they are.</td><td>还有，基于我自己的原因，我对鲁柏在画廊职位变动的事没有说什么。问我是什么原因，对你们也没有好处。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane pointed emphatically at me.It will be recalled also that Mark is Bill’s entity name.)</td><td>(在这里珍强调地指着我。还应记得，马克是比尔存有的名字。)</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest again that you reread some of our earlier material when you find time, and that you resume your psychological time experiments in some kind of schedule.</td><td>我再次建议你们找时间重读前面的资料，并建议你们按照某个行事历恢复你们的心理时间练习。</td></tr><tr><td>There are as you know barriers, boundaries and various dimensions through which you must travel in this type of inner exploration.Through training you will learn the various depths within which you travel, and to some extent gauge your own progress.</td><td>如你所知，在这种类型的内在探索中，你必须穿越障碍、界线和各种维度。通过训练，你将了解你所穿越的各种深度，并在某个程度上衡量你自己的进展。</td></tr><tr><td>Psychological time is indeed the only medium, or framework, within which exploration of the inner self can be carried on.Again, you should both find yourselves coming within a sphere of activity in your experiments, with the coming of autumn.For reasons that I will discuss later, the shift of seasons always gives rise to added bursts of psychic energy, though indeed the added bursts of psychic energy are in main responsible for the shift of seasons.</td><td>心理时间的确是唯一的媒介，或架构，在此架构内可以进行内在自己的探索。此外，随着秋天的到来，你们都会发现自己在实验中进入了一个活动范围。原因)我在后面会讨论，季节的转换总是会引起额外的灵性能量的爆发，尽管如此，灵性能量的额外爆发，确实是季节转换的主要原因。</td></tr><tr><td>I believe that you will find during such times that you achieve higher plateaus of success at these times, and the natural aspects of the season's change will themselves trigger such inner activity, if only you allow it.</td><td>我相信在这段期间你会发现，你在这些时候会达到更高的成功高度，而季节变化的自然方面本身就会触发这种内在活动，只要你允许。</td></tr><tr><td>Here we have a combination of forces psychic showing themselves in chemical and electrical manifestations.The seasons as you know represent the physical construction of the inner psychic climate.As particular portions of matter are transformed, as the inner self, through the inner senses creates a simple material object that is picked up by the outer senses clearly as, say, a table, so are these other constructions that closely mirror inner reality that are perceived by the outer senses as effects.</td><td>在这里，我们有一种灵性力量的组合，以化学和电的显化形式展示自己。正如你们所知，季节代表内在灵性气候的物质建构。当物质的特定部分被转化时，作为内在的自己，通过内在的感官创造了一个简单的物质物体，这物体被外在的感官清楚地捕捉到，比如说，一张桌子，同样的，这些密切反映内在实相的其他建构也是如此，被外在的感官感知为效应结果。</td></tr><tr><td>These constructions cannot be easily pointed to.You can point here—</td><td>这些建构不容易被指出来。你可以指着这里——</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane tapped on the table.)</td><td>(珍敲拍着桌子。)</td></tr><tr><td>—and say this is a table, and nearly all will agree.But the seasons are automatic constructions along the lines of alterations, happening to matter already constructed.</td><td>——说这是一张桌子，几乎所有人都会同意。但季节是沿着改变的路线自动建构的，发生在已经构建的物质上。</td></tr><tr><td>You cannot for example see autumn, but only its effects upon matter already constructed.The seasons represent indeed a more or less regular inner sweep and rhythm that finds expression through altering what psychic energy has already created.</td><td>例如，你不能看到秋天，而只能看到它对已经构建的物质的影响。季节确实代表了一种或多或少有规律的内在波动和节奏，通过改变灵性能量已经创造的东西找到表达。</td></tr><tr><td>There are, then, constructions that are known only through their effects.These constructions are those which most closely approximate inner reality, in that they are not as completely imprisoned in form or matter, but in themselves change form or matter.</td><td>于是，有一些建构只有通过它们的影响才能被得知。这些建构是那些最近似内在实相的建构，因为它们不是完全被禁锢在形态或物质中，而是本身就改变了形态或物质。</td></tr><tr><td>This you will find extremely important in later discussions.</td><td>在以后的讨论中，你们会发现这一点极为重要。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt is blocking a picture of Philip.I see him in a kitchen, and among some disagreement—disagreements, on this date.</td><td>鲁柏正挡着一个菲利普的画面。我看见他在一间厨房里，在争执——有一些争执，在这个日期。</td></tr><tr><td>("Who is he with?"</td><td>("他和谁？"</td></tr><tr><td>(This statement took me by surprise, until I remembered that in the 63rd session, June 17, 1964, page 159, Seth had given a date of Sept. 2 in which plans "may be born at that date which will affect his participation in his professional field."

she was, she said, afraid she would make a mistake—especially in the beginning of the session.When I said the session was well under way by now, Jane pointed out that her definition of the beginning includes all material given up until and including first break.</td><td>(9:25休息。珍像往常一样解离，她记得她在阻拦；她说，她害怕会搞错——尤其是在课刚开始的时候。当我说课程已经开始好一阵子了，珍指出，她对开始的定义是，一直到休息前所给出的全部资料，包括第一次休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(After that her dissociation is deeper and more secure, she said, and she is not so afraid of mistakes or distortions.For my part, considering the recent success concerning the material involving Bill Macdonnel, I wanted to get as much information as I could on John this evening so that we could check against it later.</td><td>(她说，在那之后，她的解离就更深、更安全了，她也不那么害怕错误或扭曲了。就我而言，基于最近与比尔相关资料的成功比对之后，我想今天晚上尽可能多地拿到和约翰有关的资料，以便日后核对这些资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill said that he still could not recall the rowboat with the symbol on it at the Provincetown dock, although he readily agreed that he could have seen it and forgotten it.He explained that due to the construction of the wharf one saw just to the left as he looked out the front room in question, that it would be quite difficult to see as small an object as a rowboat tied up there; the wharf is quite high, and due to the slant of the beach a small low object like a rowboat would be hard to see.</td><td>(比尔说，他仍然想不起在普罗温斯顿的码头有那艘带有标志的小船，不过他也认同，他可能看到但却忘记了它。他解释说，由于码头的建设，当他从前面的房间看出去时，就看到左边的码头，很难看到像划艇)这样的小船停在那里；码头很高，由于海滩的斜度，像划艇这样的小船很难被看到。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill did say he remembered another kind of boat there, some kind of barge and derrick craft.I asked him if he had any friends who might still be there, that he could write to for verification.</td><td>(不过比尔的确说，他记得那里有另一种船，某种驳船和井架船。我问他是否有任何朋友可能还在那里，他可以写信求证。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in a rather normal voice at 9:30.)</td><td>(9:30珍以相当正常的声音继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>There was a green boat, tied, that was not empty, but had bulky shapes in it, and some dark material.A bit away, and low, and with no motor, that was used twice a week and on one other designated day.I suggest that we drop the subject.</td><td>那里有一艘绿色的船，系在那里，上面不是空的，里面有一些体积很大的东西，还有一些黑色的物体。距离有点远，而且很低，没有马达，船一个星期使用两次，另外还有一个指定的日子。我建议，我们放下这个话题。</td></tr><tr><td>You will find new abundances of energy, as I told you, and you can use this to better your physical constructions, and to enrich psychological time experiments.</td><td>你会发现新的丰沛的能量，如我告诉过你们的，你们可以用它来改善你们的物质建构，并丰富心理时间实验。</td></tr><tr><td>When I speak of bettering material constructions, I speak of more perfect constructions, more faithful replicas of thought into matter, and hence I speak of the breaking up of unfortunate cycles caused by the influence of shoddy physical constructions in environment, that in turn color the inner self’s notion of the material world.</td><td>当我说改善物质建构的时候，我说的是更完善的建构，更忠实地将思想复制到物质中，因此我说的是，打破受环境中粗劣的物质建构的影响所造成的不幸循)环，因为这些粗劣的物质建构会反过来影响内在自己对物质世界的概念。</td></tr><tr><td>Because I kept you so long during an unscheduled session, I intend to keep you now only for a brief period.We will soon begin to return to the inner senses, tying them in with our discussion on matter.</td><td>因为我在临时课上让你们待了那么久，所以我打算现在只耽搁你们一点时间。我们很快就会回到内在感官，把它们和我们对物质的讨论联系起来。</td></tr><tr><td>I will now, in line with my policy of balancing out our sessions, end this one.I bid you all a fond good evening—and you cannot blame me now for taking up more than the allotted time which we have allowed ourselves.</td><td>按照我平衡上课时间的方针，我现在将结束这一节。我祝你们有个美好的夜晚——现在你们可不能怪我占用了超过我们自己所允许的分配时间。</td></tr><tr><td>One note to Mark.I have mentioned rather strenuously that it is most necessary for him to find his own establishment.The twinges that he feels are indeed warnings, or nudges rather, from his own subconscious mind, that he do this and thus bring the plans for it into actual reality.</td><td>给马克一个说明。我曾经很费劲地提到，他极有必要找到属于他自己的住处。他感觉到的刺痛确实是警告，或者说是催促，来自他潜意识的心智，希望他这样做，从而将计划变成现实。</td></tr><tr><td>Three nights ago he had a dream that symbolically also gave him the same directions.At another time we will go into the importance of dreams on their various levels, and outline the kinds of dreams more thoroughly than has been done by psychologists to date.The subject will be of great interest to you, and we shall use your own dreams as examples.</td><td>三个晚上前，他做了一个梦，象征性地给了他同样的指示。我们会在别的时间探讨梦的各个层次的重要性，并概述梦的种类，比心理学家迄今所做的要更彻底。这个主题会引起你们的极大兴趣，我们会用你们自己的梦来做例子。</td></tr><tr><td>("Can you tell us more about John Bradley now?’’)</td><td>("你现在能多说点关于约翰-布拉德利的事吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>Only the kitchen incident, approximately eight ten.I do not know whose kitchen.I presume it a kitchen, because of a table of that type.</td><td>只有厨房事件，大约在8点10分。我不知道是谁家的厨房。我推测是厨房，因为有一张像是放在厨房里的那种桌子。</td></tr><tr><td>("What were the people there talking about?")</td><td>("那些人在说什么？")</td></tr><tr><td>I cannot now tell you any more.

having to do with the gallery.I am not going to have these sessions deal with mental tricks, even though the end would be a good one.The demonstrations of this sort will always arise spontaneously, and the spontaneous data that so arises will usually be accurate.</td><td>我还要补充——和这件事无关——最近鲁伯正在学习让他的潜意识为他工作，而不是对抗他；这和画廊的事有关。我不打算让这些课程处理精神上的把戏，尽管结局会很好。这类的示范总是会自发产生，而这样产生的自发性资料通常是准确的。</td></tr><tr><td>In a deep trance we could tell you much, Ruburt and I, but I still agree on the principles of cooperation, and always follow the dictates of caution.Ruburt’s abilities along these lines are great, but it is necessary always that certain controls are maintained;

on this point Bill was not sure.The top of the boat was green, the bottom white.He also remembered a green rowboat that was anchored out in font of the house.Bill then suggested that he write to Larry O’Toole for confirmation, since as far as he knew O’Toole should still be in Provincetown.In particular, O’Toole could check on the rowboat with a symbol on its bow, as described by Seth.</td><td>(10:07结束。珍解离如常。比尔说他不记得他的梦了。不过，他确认了有一艘绿白相间的船停在海湾，从拉里-奥图尔小屋的字体室可以看到。他说那是一艘大约15英尺长的船舱型快艇，里面可能有一些东)西；在这一点上，比尔并不确定。船的顶部是绿色的，底部是白色的。他还记得有一艘绿色的小船停在)房子的前面。然后比尔建议，他给拉里-奥图尔写信求证，因为据他所知，奥图尔应该还在普罗旺斯镇。特别是，奥图尔可以查看一下赛斯所描述的船头有标志的划艇。</td></tr><tr><td>(While the three of us were discussing the session, and the fact that Jane seemed much less tired than before the session began, she suddenly began dictating again.Her voice was somewhat louder than normal.Jane spoke for most of the time while seated upon the table.Resume at 10:17.)</td><td>(当我们三个人在讨论这节课，以及珍似乎没有像课开始前那么累的事实时，她突然又开始传述了。她的声音比平常大了一些。大部分时间，珍都坐在桌子旁边说话。10:17继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>One note.You both can and should learn to utilize your energies in the same manner that Ruburt utilizes his energies during a session.His fatigue is not only forgotten, but he is no longer fatigued although his working day was personally exhausting.</td><td>一个小说明。你们都可以，而且应该学学，以鲁柏在上课时利用能量的方式来利用你们的能量。他的疲劳不仅被忘记了，而且他也不再疲劳，尽管他的工作日是个人方面的精疲力尽。</td></tr><tr><td>It is a fact beyond dispute that at a later hour he is able to avail himself of energy not usually available to him, and to use this energy constructively and effectively.Without duplicating the exact circumstances the three of you in this room can learn to use your energy as effectively in ordinary pursuits.There is a change of focus.Mark has also much energy that he is not using.</td><td>一个无可争议的事实是，在较晚的时候，他能够利用通常无法获得的能量，并建设性地、有效地使用这能量。不需要复制确切的情境，你们三人在这个房间里可以学会有效地利用你们的能量于日常的追求中。有一个焦点的变化。马克也有很多能量没有被用到。</td></tr><tr><td>He is given, indeed, to a peculiar habit of sloth which he must conquer if his artistic abilities are to bear fruit.And you, dear friend, could do with giving your intuitions greater freedom, for you are already adequately blessed with self-discipline.</td><td>他确实有一种特别懒散的习惯，如果他的艺术能力要开花结果，他必须克服这个习惯。而你，亲爱的朋友，可以给你的直觉更大的自由，因为你已经有足够的自律能力了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane was looking at me.)</td><td>(这时珍看着我。)</td></tr><tr><td>I certainly will here refrain from even suggesting that you put your intuitions to work in practical terms, since this obviously does not meet with your wholehearted approval, but falls far short.</td><td>我当然会避免建议你把你的直觉用在实际工作上，因为这明显地不会得到你全心全意的认可，甚至还远远不及。</td></tr><tr><td>Mark is considering a commitment to an idea.Unless he studies himself most thoroughly, he must take great pains to see that the commitment is followed up by self-discipline.You should see to it that your self-discipline follows the dictates of intuition.If you will excuse the comment, Ruburt is either all self-discipline or all intuition.</td><td>马克正在考虑对一个想法做出承诺。除非他对自己进行了最彻底的研究，否则他要吃尽苦头才会了解到，承诺之后是自律。你应该注意的是你的自律遵循直觉的指示。恕我直言，鲁伯要么是完全自律，要么是完全凭直觉。</td></tr><tr><td>He should endeavor to tie the two together, in some kind of package.I will not make any practical suggestions anymore unless you ask me on the proverbial bended knee.I meet with suspicion;

adequately through the sublimating fabrications of fantasy into creative prose and poetry, in which I am in no way involved.I make no attempt, for example, to inspire Ruburt in his own creative work.However if he did not have such an outlet, and if you did not have such an outlet in your own work, then indeed we would have had much more trouble, because this layer of personal subconscious would then be not merely a receptive channel but one that also radioed its own noisy and demanding stations.</td><td>他的个人潜意识，让我感到宽慰，我希望这也让你感到宽慰，通过将幻想升华为创造性的散文和诗歌，已经很好地照顾了自己，我没有参与其中。例如，我没有试图在鲁伯自己的创作中激发他的灵感。然而，如果他没有这样的出口，如果你在自己的工作中没有这样的出口，那么我们确实会有更多的麻烦，因为这层个人潜意识将不仅仅是一个接收的渠道，而且是一个也会广播自己的嘈杂和要求的电台。</td></tr><tr><td>This would have presented a great difficulty, as indeed it does when individuals with no adequate transference system for the subconscious, attempt investigations such as these.</td><td>当一个个体潜意识没有适当的转移系统，而试图进行这样的调查时，这将代表一个巨大的难题，确实如此。</td></tr><tr><td>I realize and understand that both of you rather suspect personal material when I give it.Even Ruburt believes it most possible that such material is somehow the result of his own personal subconscious conniving.Such is not the case.</td><td>我明白也理解，当我提供个人资料时，你们两个人都相当怀疑。甚至鲁伯也认为，这种资料很可能是他个人潜意识纵容的结果。事实并非如此。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true that it is difficult for you to take me at my word when I suggest action in the practical world, particularly when such suggested action may seem neither practical nor possible.I know this.I should be more understanding.</td><td>的确，当我建议在现实世界中采取行动，你们很难相信我的话，特别是当这种建议的行动看起来既不实际也不可能时。我知道这一点。我应该更体谅一点。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not perfect.I am a personality, not a deity, all understanding and all just, and I am at times irascible.I do not mean to be unreasonable.You do not have to worry that I will deliver only personal material, but this material tonight is important as far as our relationship is concerned.</td><td>我并不完美。我是一个人格，不是神灵，善解人意，公正无私，有时候我还很暴躁。我不是不讲道理的。你们不必担心我只提供个人资料，但就我们的关系而言，今晚的这份资料很重要。</td></tr><tr><td>I am thinking of the long terms, and many subjects shall be covered throughout the years, with your cooperation.Now Ruburt, again, suspects strongly that my remark concerning my hope that this material be read throughout the world is the result of some inhibited egomania on his part.This is the result of your joint interpretation.I realize that the material is no new bible, believe me.It does, however, represent facts that are not generally known, and that should be communicated, regardless of their source.I see nothing grossly egocentric in this remark, and if you do not consider the material valid, then why spend so much time with it?</td><td>我考虑的是长远性的，在你们的合作下，许多主题将在这些年里涵盖。现在，鲁伯再次强烈怀疑我的言论，关于希望这些资料在全世界被阅读的说法，怀疑是他的一些抑制不住的自大狂的结果。这就是你们共同诠释的结果。我知道这份资料不是新圣经，相信我。然而，它确实代表了一些不为人知的事实，无论其来源如何，都应该被传达出去。我看不出这句话有什么严重的自我中心主义，如果你不认为这些资料是合理有效的，那么为什么要花这么多时间在它身上？</td></tr><tr><td>My personality may indeed at times show that I am somewhat of an impatient man, who boxes his pupils’ ears, symbolically of course, but I have never made any pretense to be other than I am.</td><td>我的个性有时的确会显示出我是一个没耐心，会打学生耳光的那种人，当然这只是象征性的说法，但我从)来没有伪装过自己。</td></tr><tr><td>I will let you take your first break.And with this material as a preface I will begin with a brief explanation of the Frank Watts material.</td><td>我会让你们休息一下。在这段当作前言的资料之后，我要开始稍微解释一下弗兰克·沃茨的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26.Jane was fully dissociated—-far out, as she puts it.

In spite of this state, she did remember the material, especially the part about the material making its way around the world.</td><td>(9:26休息。珍完全解离——出去很远，她这么说，"赛斯的声音响亮而清晰"。尽管处于这种深度出神状态，但她记得这段资料，尤其是关于资料传遍全世界这部分。</td></tr><tr><td>(She resumed in a slightly quieter voice, although still briskly, at 9:31.)</td><td>(9:31她以略微安静的声音继续传述，但仍然很轻快。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now.The Seth material begins with the Seth material.Period.</td><td>现在。赛斯资料从赛斯资料开始。就是这样。</td></tr><tr><td>I will now explain to you where the Watts material came from, its significance, and the reason for its distortions.</td><td>我现在要向你们解释沃茨资料的来源、它的意义以及它扭曲的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>I did not want to go into this in the beginning.I did not want to impede your progress or hurt your sense of confidence.Again, as far as I am concerned, and I am Seth, the Seth material begins with the Seth material.</td><td>我不想在一开始就谈这个。我不想阻碍你们的进步，也不想伤害你们的自信感。再者，就我而言，我就是赛斯，赛斯资料从赛斯资料开始。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane had suspected the above would be Seth's answer, and had told me so over the weekend.This means that Seth first actually announced his presence, by name, on page 23 of the material and during the 4th session.However, the character of the answers we had been receiving for some little while before this point had been reached, had changed from the type of answer Frank Watts had been giving; I recall that even then we had wondered whether some other entity than Frank Watts had become involved.</td><td>(珍曾猜测以上会是赛斯的答案，并在周末告诉过我。这意味着赛斯第一次，用他的名字，真正宣布他的存在是在第23页(*英文版)和第4节课期间。然而，在这个时间点之前，已有一阵子，我们收到的答案的性质，已经从弗兰克-沃茨所给出的答案类型中改变了；我记得即使在那个时候，我们就怀疑是否有弗兰克-沃茨以外的其他存有参与其中。</td></tr><tr><td>(On the other hand we did not doubt that some kind of a connection with Frank Watts had been established first.We just thought it garbled.Jane's coworker at the gallery, Mrs. Borst, who is now retired, had stated definitely that she had known a Frank Watts who had died in the 1940 's, and had also known his sister Treva.)</td><td>(另一方面，我们并不怀疑与弗兰克·沃茨之间的某种连结在那之前就已经建立起来了。我们只是认为它是混乱的。珍在画廊的同事，博斯特女士，她现在已经退休了，她明确表示认识一位死于1940年代的弗兰克)-沃茨，而且还认识他的妹妹特雷瓦(Treva)。)</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless, much of the Watts material was valid.The distortions, too numerous to mention here, were the result of inexperience, not only on Ruburt's part, but also on the part of the personality who did live and was called Frank Watts.</td><td>然而，沃茨的大部分资料都是有效的。歪曲的地方，不胜枚举，都是缺乏经验的结果，不仅是鲁伯的部分，也是那个确实活过，被称为弗兰克-沃茨的人格的部分。</td></tr><tr><td>He was a personality from my entity, entirely independent from me and from my control, as I have explained that such personalities are.Ruburt’s abilities were only beginning to show themselves, and had what we may refer to as a low-range frequency.There was an affinity to begin with, but Ruburt simply could not reach far enough, or within and through the inner senses enough, to contact me directly; and there are what you may call for simplicity’s sake, conventions of conduct which I would not break.</td><td>他是一个来自我的存有的人格，完全独立于我，也不受我的控制，正如我所解释的那样，这种人格是独立的。鲁柏的能力才刚刚开始显示出来，具有我们所说的低范围的频率(low-rangefrequency)。一开始就有一种亲缘关系，但鲁柏就是没办法伸得够远，或者说没)办法深入，没办法通过内在感官直接和我联系；有一些，我们可以为了简单起见，称它为行为公约)(conventionsofconduct)的规范，那是我必须遵守的。</td></tr><tr><td>Had I attempted myself to contact Ruburt then, the contact would have amounted to a sort of psychic invasion, which I would find most unethical on my part.</td><td>如果我当时试图自己联系鲁伯，这种联系就相当于一种灵性入侵，我认为这对我来说是最不道德的。</td></tr><tr><td>Frank Watts was closer, and acted as an unconscious relay station on the one hand, while on the other hand his unconscious gave consent.The material which came through was extremely garbled, some distortions resulting from Ruburt’s inexperience, and some simply in translation.</td><td>弗兰克·沃茨离得更近，一方面充当了无意识的中继站，另一方面他的无意识也同意了。传来的资料极其混乱，有些是由于鲁伯缺乏经验而造成的扭曲，有些则只是在转译上。</td></tr><tr><td>This was the reason for the rather abrupt switch from the Frank Watts identity to my own.This is why I did not give my name to the initial endeavors, so that I could cast them adrift.Nevertheless, they represented a necessary beginning in these endeavors, and a beginning for which no apology is needed on your part or on mine.</td><td>这就是为什么从弗兰克-沃茨的身份突然转换到我的身份的原因。这就是为什么我没有在最初的努力中给出我的名字的原因，这样我就可以把它们抛在一边。然而，它们代表了这些努力的一个必要的开端，一个不需要你或我道歉的开始。</td></tr><tr><td>The material partially was picked up or initiated by Ruburt on a subconscious level from Mrs. Borst, who was I believe at the gallery during that time.There was a Frank Watts.Mrs. Borst did know of him, and he did exist as an independent personality.</td><td>资料有一部分是鲁柏在一个潜意识层从博斯特夫人那里获得的或起头的，我相信那段时间博斯特夫人在画廊工作。的确有一个叫弗兰克-沃茨的人。博斯特夫人)确实认识他，而他确实是一个独立存在的人格。</td></tr><tr><td>("Can you give us some dates?")</td><td>(你能告诉我们一些日期吗？)</td></tr><tr><td>Because of Ruburt's reaction I will not this evening.On another occasion I will slyly insert them in the middle of the material.They, or rather the Frank Watts material, must however be considered then separate from my material.My material is the material in which I use my name.</td><td>由于鲁柏的反应，我今晚就不说了。有机会的话，我会在资料的中间巧妙地插入它们。然而，它们，或者说弗兰克-沃茨的资料，必须与我的资料分开来考虑。我的资料是我使用自己名字的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>During fall and the winter we will continue long sessions on the inner senses, the nature of matter, time, and also discuss other means by which you may personally experiment.</td><td>在秋冬期间，我们将继续长时段的课程，探讨内在感官、物质的本质、时间，还将讨论其他你们可以亲自实验的方法。</td></tr><tr><td>I will endeavor, because of your reactions, not to discuss aspects of your practical existence, though you should be told that regardless such discussions are to your benefit.Nevertheless I will defer to what I believe is your wish in this matter.I do not have to defer gracefully, however.</td><td>鉴于你们的反应，我将努力不去讨论你们实际存在的方方面面，虽然应该告诉你们，不管怎样，这样的讨论对你们是有益的。尽管如此，在这件事上我还是会遵从你们的意愿。不过，我不一定要优雅地顺从。</td></tr><tr><td>("I don’t mind.")</td><td>("我不介意"。)</td></tr><tr><td>You speak with your tongue only.Then I will remark—</td><td>你只是嘴上说不介意。那我就说——</td></tr><tr><td>(Here, Jane's voice boomed out suddenly.)</td><td>(这里，珍的声音突然轰隆而出。)</td></tr><tr><td>-that I knew what I was doing when I abruptly and rather strongly, I admit, suggested that Ruburt leave the gallery, two full days before he was given his precious assistant directorship.</td><td>——我知道我在做什么，当我突然而且相当强烈地建议鲁伯离开画廊时，我承认，那是在他得到宝贝的助理主管职位的整整两天之前。</td></tr><tr><td>You both suspected all sorts of tricky subconscious motives on Ruburt’s part.The fact is, had he followed my suggestion then, affairs for him would have been much simpler.As it is, on his own with your help, because of quite practical events, he has chosen to leave, after having accepted the assistant directorship.Had he taken my suggestion when I gave it, affairs would have gone smoother.As it is there will be misunderstandings that could have been avoided.</td><td>你们都怀疑鲁柏的潜意识的各种狡猾动机。事实是，如果他当时听从了我的建议，他的事情就会简单得多。就像现在这样，在你的帮助下，由于一些很实际的事件，他在接受助理主管这个职位之后，选择了离职。如果他一开始就接受了我的建议，事情就会发展得较平顺。现在的情况是，将会有一些本来可以避免的误解。</td></tr><tr><td>Now.He blocked some of that material.However the urgency was apparent; since it was given in a sudden unscheduled session that much came through.I knew he would leave in any case.I wanted him to leave before he was offered the position.It may not, the position may not really mean much to him, but its acceptance by him was taken as a sign of his willingness to accept conditions at the gallery, and his resignation will not be as understandable to those there as it would have been earlier.</td><td>现在。他挡住了一部分资料。不论如何，那份急迫是很明显的；因为那是在一个突然的临时课程上给出的，所以很多资料都传进来了。我知道他无论在什么情况下都会离开。我希望他在得到那个职位之前离开。它也许不是，那个职位对他来说可能真的没有什么意义，但是他的接受，被认为是他愿意接受画廊的条件的信号，于是他的辞职，对那里的人来说，不会像以前那样可以理解。</td></tr><tr><td>Such an unscheduled session with urgent overtones should at least be studied thoroughly.I am not really suggesting that you act on blind faith, but such a session is a symptom of something in the wind that should be watched, even if Ruburt blocks the full details.</td><td>这样一个带有紧急色彩的临时课至少应该彻底研究一下。我并不是真的建议你们凭着盲目的信仰行事，但这样的临时课是某种正在发生的事情的征兆，应该受)到关注，即使鲁伯屏蔽了全部细节。</td></tr><tr><td>I cannot do less than try to keep my eye out for you, now can I?</td><td>我无法不多替你们留意，不是吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("No. ")</td><td>("不"。)</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:01.Jane was again fully dissociated.She ended the session on a note of high good humor.Her voice was now quite normal in range and volume, and she resumed in the same manner at 10:03.)</td><td>(10:01休息。珍再一次完全解离。她在高度幽默的氛围中结束了这一段。她的声音在音频和音量上都很正常。10:03她以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>This will be your long-promised short session.</td><td>这将是你们承诺已久的短课。</td></tr><tr><td>However, I will add one other note.Ruburt also had a dream which gave him clear warning of trouble, the dream in which he was at the home of the art gallery president.He, Ruburt, opened a strange door to find a threatening male figure therein.</td><td>然而，我还要补充一个说明。鲁柏还做了一个梦，清楚地警告他有麻烦，梦中，他在画廊主管的家里。他，鲁柏，打开了一道陌生的门，发现里面有一个具有威胁性的男性身影。</td></tr><tr><td>He tried to scream, could not for a frozen moment, then he screamed and ran.The door represented what seemed to be a new opportunity.The figure inside represented the actuality; that is, what seemed to be an opportunity would instead end up as a dead end, a threatening and stagnant position.The male figure represented the director, who offered the new position.The interval during which Ruburt could not scream represented the frozen interval of indecision, in which he could not act.</td><td>他想喊叫，但僵住了一会儿，喊不出来，然后他尖叫着跑了。那扇门代表着似乎是一个新的机会。里面的人物代表了真实情况；也就是说，看似是一个机会，最后只是一个死胡同，一个威胁性且停滞的职位。那个男性身影代表了提供新职位的主管。鲁布不能尖叫的那段时间，代表了他犹豫不决的冻结期。那段期)间，他无法行动。</td></tr><tr><td>The final culmination of the dream, when he did scream and run away, represented his subconscious giving him its solution.The position was threatening because it represented a possible dilution of his energies from his main objective of writing, into a superficial ego satisfaction, which would have left him basically not only unsatisfied but personally betrayed.</td><td>梦的最后高潮，当他尖叫并逃开时，代表他的潜意识给了他解决方案。这个职位具有威胁性，因为它代表他的能量可能从他的主要写作目标上被稀释，变成了肤浅的自我满足，这将使他基本上不仅不满意，而且觉得被自己出卖了。</td></tr><tr><td>He would, believe it or not, have ended up with a higher title within five years, though not of director, and it would have so soothed his inner ego that it would have settled for this.But his inner drives would never have let him settle.However, I wanted him to make the adjustments necessary to maintain balance and outward cordiality with the director, to aid his own understanding, and so that his resignation, which I hopefully foresaw, would be relatively painless.</td><td>无论你信不信，他都会在五年内获得一个更高的头衔，虽然不是主管这个位置，那职位会抚慰他的内在自我，让它安于现状。但是他内在的驱动力永远不会让他安于现状。然而，我希望他能做出必要的调整，以保持平衡，以及与主管之间的友好关系，以帮助他自己的理解，这样他的辞职——我希望能预见到——会相对地不痛不痒。</td></tr><tr><td>His dream had nothing to do with me.This can be considered an incident, that is the unscheduled session and ensuing events, that should show you that our personal material does have validity.</td><td>他的梦与我无关。这可以看作是一个事件，也就是临时课和随后发生的事件，应该让你们看到我们的个人资料确实是合理有效的。</td></tr><tr><td>The material dealing with the house was undistorted.I expected too much, and that is my fault.Notice, however, the difference in urgency given in the various suggestions.I know this is difficult to take.The fact is that had you moved, the traffic simply would not have bothered you, in your enjoyment of other features.</td><td>涉及到房子的资料是没有扭曲的。我期待太高，这是我的错。然而，请注意，在各种建议中给出的紧迫性)是不同的。我知道这很难让人接受。事实是，如果你们搬过去，在你们享受其他特色的时候，交通根本不会打扰你们。</td></tr><tr><td>I was not pressing the point, as I was with the gallery suggestion.Ruburt will improve, and is improving, as far as distortions are concerned; because, again, we are not using a deep trance state, because we are working in cooperation.The process may take longer but it is much more advantageous in the long run, and you forget that this is only the very beginning.</td><td>我不是硬逼你们，就像我对画廊的建议那样。就扭曲而言，鲁伯会改善，而且正在改善；因为，同样的，我们没有利用深度恍惚状态，因为我们是在合作中一起工作。这个过程可能需要更长的时间，但从长远来看它更有利，而且你忘了这只是最开始。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt and you are both in training, so to speak.You cannot start in at the top, and I am myself cautious.I do not want to-</td><td>可以说鲁柏和你还在训练之中。你不能从顶峰开始，而我自己是很谨慎的。我不想要——</td></tr><tr><td>(Here again Jane's voice shouted out briefly.)</td><td>(这里珍的声音再此大声喊了出来。)</td></tr><tr><td>-have to deal with any hysterics, and neither do you.Let us then progress at our own rate.The results will be well worth it.</td><td>——必须处理任何歇斯底里的问题，你们也不想。那就让我们以自己的速度前进吧。结果将是非常值得的。</td></tr><tr><td>Do not be overly concerned at any time if I suggest something that you do not think practical, but do look into such matters thoroughly.If Ruburt is blocking there should be a definite validity in any case.</td><td>如果我提出的建议你们认为不切实际，任何时候都不要过分担心，但一定要彻底研究这些问题。如果鲁柏在挡什么，那么那里头就必定有些合理的玄机。</td></tr><tr><td>If you should not feel like acting immediately, neither should you take it for granted that there is not a definite need to act.It is because we are only beginning, and because Ruburt often blocks me, that my suggestions may seem so impractical.It is the concrete material he fears.</td><td>如果你们不觉得该立即行动，也不该想当然地认为没有必要去做。正是因为我们才刚刚开始，也因为鲁伯经常阻挠我，我的建议才会显得如此不切实际。他怕的就是这种非常具体又实际的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>I now wish you a fond good evening.You can count on some fat and meaty data on less personal matters for future sessions.Take heart, however, from the fact that you are both in excellent overall condition, for this is very important in all your endeavors.</td><td>现在我要祝你们有个美好的夜晚。未来的课程，你们可以指望得到一些比较少个人资料的丰厚肥美的内容。然而，请注意，你们俩的整体状况都很好，因为这对你们所有的努力都非常重要。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth. "</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 10:28.Jane was dissociated as usual.Both of us remember the dream of Jane's that Seth discussed.It was a very vivid one, and quite unpleasant, and Jane told me about it as soon as she awoke.She also immediately wrote it down, in detail, in her dream notebook.She had the dream on the night of Sunday, August 30; and the next day she was given the assistant directorship at the gallery.)</td><td>(10:28结束。珍解离如常。我们俩都还记得赛斯讨论的那个珍的梦。那是一个非常生动的梦，而且令人相当不舒服，珍一醒来就告诉了我。她还立刻把它详细地记下来，写在她的梦笔记本上。她是在8月30日星期日晚上做的梦；第二天，画廊就晋升她为助理主管。)</td></tr><table border="1">
