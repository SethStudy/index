It contained all the abilities of your friend, whether latent or not I do not know.This type of personality fragment is of different origin than your friend, who is himself a fragment of his own entity.We call this type a split personality fragment, or a personality image fragment. Usually it cannot operate on all levels of your physical plane.</td><td>(珍继续:)从某种意义上说，任何一世的当前个体，都可被称为它整体存有的一个片段，并具有源头存有的所有属性，尽管它们是潜在的或是未被使用的。在 这个意义上，人格片段可以学习发展它所拥有的，而不是寻求新的力量。没有新 的力量。正如我所说的，你朋友看到的影象，是他自己的人格片段。它包含了你</td></tr><tr><td>Seldom, but sometimes, an individual may send a personality fragment image into another level of existence entirely, even without his own knowledge. This image personality fragment may even gain valuable experience on this other level. It will then return to the individual.Sometimes the individual is not even capable of assimilating this knowledge, or even recognizing his own returning personality image.The type of fragment your friend saw was something like this latter personality image, but so disconnected from your friend, and so absent-mindedly was it sent upon its travels, that its information was probably passed directly to the entity which your friend represents.</td><td>朋友的所有能力，是否是潜伏的我并不知道。这种类型的人格片段与你朋友的起 源不同，你朋友本身是他自己存有的一个片段。你朋友看到的影象我们称之为分 裂的人格片段，或人格形象片段。通常情况下，它不能在你们物质层面的所有层 次上运作。很少，但有时，一个个体，可能会在他自己并不知道的情况下，把自己的一个人 格片段形象完全地送入另一个存在的层次。这个形象的人格片段，甚至可能在这 另一个层次上获得宝贵的经验，然后再返回到个体。有时，这个个体甚至没有能 力吸收这些知识，甚至没有能力认出这个他自己返回的人格形象。你朋友看到的 人格形象，就像后一种人格形象，但它与你的朋友是如此的脱节，如此心不在焉 地被送上了旅程，它的信息可能会直接传递给你朋友所代表的存有。</td></tr><tr><td>Increased concentration of the conscious individual is the trend.Then these split personality fragments or images can be kept under scrutiny without taxing the present ego to distraction.Now, the subconscious performs this task- not too well, since it was never meant to focus clear attention.</td><td>提高有意识的个体之专注力是一种趋势。如此一来，这些分裂的人格片段或形象 可以保持在被审视之下，而不至于让目前的自我分心。潜意识执行这项任务—执 行得不太好，因为潜意识的功能本来就不以聚焦清晰的注意力为目的。</td></tr><tr><td>The consciousness will expand on your planet, just as it expands for those who go beyond your plane.The scope of consciousness will be so broadened in the future that all personality fragments, split personality images, and even individual fragments in succeeding incarnations, will be held in clear focus without strain.It is toward this that evolution on the earthly plane is headed, though of course with its usual donkey-slow rate.</td><td>意识将在你们的星球上扩展，就像它对那些超越你们层面的个体之扩展一样。意 识的范围在未来将如此扩大，以至于所有的人格片段、分裂的人格形象，甚至在 后续的转世的个人片段，都将被清晰地聚焦、而不会产生压力。地球上的演化是 正朝着这个方向发展的，当然，是以其贯有的驴步的缓慢速度。</td></tr><tr><td>In the meantime, when incarnations on the planet earth are finished the entity moves toward this goal anyway.In any case by the time that this goal is reached on the earthly plane, those who have passed from it will have evolved in ways of which even I can only dream.Now rest your hand.</td><td>同时，当在地球这个星球上的转世完成后，存有无论如何都会朝着这个目标前 进。在任何情况下，当这个目标在地球层面达成时，那些已经跨越这个目标的个 体，将以甚至我只能梦想的方式进行演化。现在，让你的手休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:50.By now I had developed writer's cramp from taking the above down at nearly top speed.We were both by now more than a little surprised and amazed.Jane had delivered the entire monologue exactly as I have recorded it here.She made no mistakes in delivery, did not lose her way, make any changes or corrections of any kind at all.She said that Seth would have outdistanced her had she insisted on keeping to the board.She had to recite it because the words sounded within her.Resume at 10:00.</td><td>(9:50。到了现在，我已经因为以最快速度写下上述内容而引发了书写痉挛。我 们俩现在已经不止是讶异和赞叹了。珍完成了整个独白，与我所记录的完全一样。她在独白过程中没有失误，没有迷了方向，也没有做任何形式的更改或修 正。她说，如果她坚持使用显灵板，赛斯会把她抛在后头。因为这些字句在她内 在响起，她不得不念诵一遍。10:00 恢复。)</td></tr><tr><td>("Seth, did I get all that down correctly?")</td><td>("赛斯，我都记对了吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>I said what I said.I presume you got it all.Take a break.</td><td>我说了我所说的。我假定你都记下了。休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(We took a short additional rest.During it, I remarked that the next question I wanted to ask Seth was whether either Jane or I, or both of us, had ever unknowingly seen a fragment of the type our friend Bill MacDonnell had.Once again, pacing back and forth while I took down the message, Jane began to dictate:)</td><td>(我们又休息了一会儿。这期间，我说，我想问赛斯的下一个问题是，珍或我， 或是我们俩，是否曾看到过我们的朋友比尔·麦克唐纳的那种片段而不自知？在 我记下了讯息时，珍再次来回踱步，开始传述:)</td></tr><tr><td>The man and the woman in the York Beach dancing establishment, sitting across the floor alone at a table. They were fragments of sour selves, thrown-off materializations of your own negative and aggressive feelings.Jane's were even stronger than yours, since the woman was fatter than the man.She almost recognized them because of the circumstances and your illness, and because of the peculiar vitality of your conflicting emotions at the time.</td><td>单独地坐在约克海滨舞池对面桌旁的男人和女人，是你们酸楚的自己之片段，是 你们自己负面和好斗情绪抛出来的物质化片段。珍的感觉甚至比你的更强烈，因 为那个女人比那个男人更胖。由于当时的情况和你的病，也由于你那时矛盾情绪 的奇特活力，她几乎认出了他们。</td></tr><tr><td>These fragments existed for a longer period, had solidity and did not deteriorate, because you gave them continued inflation.At the same time these fragments contained your intellect, and therefore they partially recognized you and Jane.</td><td>这些片段存在的时间较长，有稳定性，没有退化，因为你们持续让它膨胀。同 时，这些片段也拥有你们的智力，因此，它们也多少认出了你和珍。</td></tr><tr><td>Your friend's image fragment did not recognize him because he was not strongly attuned.His emotions were not creativelyâif you'll excuse the termâdestructive.You and Jane both have a peculiar problem in that you are creative even when you are destructive.</td><td>你朋友的形象片段没认出你的朋友，因为你的朋友非常的不协调。他的情感不具 创造性而是破坏性 - 如果你不介意我用这个词。你和珍俩人都有即使在破坏性中，也仍具有创造性的奇特问题。</td></tr><tr><td>Please do not comment, because Jane is having enough troubles with me tonight as it is.Ruburt, you are doing fine.Speaking about the problem you mentioned, because your aggressions are fairly well controlled consciously, and because in the present your creative energies are in the realm of your subconscious, at this stage they can be, and often are, used to create unhappy image personality situations such as at York Beach.You can rely to some extent on Jane's intuition, which has been strong in all her incarnations.However, often she will only recognize something strange, and be unable as in that case to pinpoint the trouble.</td><td>请不要发表评论，因为珍今晚在我这里遇到的麻烦已经够多了。鲁伯，你做得很 好。谈到你提到的问题，因为你相当有意识地控制了你的攻击性；而且你目前的 创造能量在你的潜意识领域，在这个阶段，它们可以，而且经常被用来创造不快 乐的性格形象的处境，就像在约克海滨那样的人格形象。你可以在一定程度上依 靠珍的直觉，珍的直觉在她所有的转世中都很强。然而，往往她也只能看出某些 事情很奇怪，而不能在那些事件中，准确地指出问题所在。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take a break and stick your heads for a moment out the window.If I read Jane correctly the kitchen window is the most accessible.</td><td>我建议休息一下，并把头伸到窗外一会儿。如果我看珍没看错的话，那么厨房的 窗户是最方便的。</td></tr><tr><td>(We took the break as suggested.I remembered that we had today also received a Christmas card from the owners of the hotel where we had stopped at York Beach, Maine: Ocean House.</td><td>(我们按建议休息了一下。我想起来，今天还收到了一张圣诞卡，是我们在缅因 州约克海滨停留过的旅馆的业主寄来的：海洋之家。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane and I of course clearly remembered the couple referred to by Seth in the above monologue.I recall that at the time Jane had seen them first, and pointed them out to me.I remember that she had seemed oddly intrigued by them, and that they had borne more than a little physical resemblance to us.The woman's face especially had reminded me of Jane, though she had indeed been fatter.The man had my build, my shape of head, and much whiter hair.They had been a peculiarly unsmiling couple.I recall also that Jane mentioned that she wanted to talk to them.I had not wanted to, and we did not approach them.</td><td>(珍和我当然清楚地记得赛斯上述独白里提到的那对夫妇。我记得，当时珍先看 到他们，并把他们指给我看。我记得珍异样地对他们很感兴趣，他们的外型和我 们很相似。那女士的脸尤其是让我想到珍，虽然她确实很胖。该名男子身材和我 一样，头型也一样，只是头发更白。一对面无笑容的古怪夫妇。我还记得珍说过，她想与他们交谈。但我不想，所以没去跟他们接触。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed dictating:)</td><td>(珍继续传述:)</td></tr><tr><td>Jane's entity is an extremely strong one.Her intuition represents glimpses by her present person of her whole entity.As a rule these intuitions come through strongly.However, she is not operating at full entity level any more than you are, so you cannot rely upon her intuitions to catch all the mistakes that you may make.</td><td>珍的存有是非常强大的一个。她的直觉代表了她的整体存有在现实个人中的一 瞥。一般说来，这些直觉来得很强烈。然而，她并没有在整体存有阶层上能比你 运作得更多，所以你不要依赖她的直觉，来挑出你所有可能犯的错误。</td></tr><tr><td>(Meaning mistakes on the part of both of us, Jane said.</td><td>(意思就是我们俩的错误，珍说。</td></tr><tr><td>("Seth, why did I make Jane get up and do the twist with me in that dancing establishment at York Beach?")</td><td>("赛斯，我为什么在约克海滨的舞池把珍拉起来和我一起跳扭扭舞？")</td></tr><tr><td>At the time, one of the reasons for the two split personality fragments was the power of the struggle going on at that time.The images were formed by the culminating energy of your destructive powers.While you did not recognize them consciously, unconsciously you knew them well.Unconsciously you saw the image of your destructive tendencies, and these images themselves roused you to combat them.</td><td>当时，原因之一是那两个分裂的人格片段，在当时具有继续挣扎的能力。那个形 象形成于你们所积累的破坏力。虽然你们没能有意识地把他们辨识出来，但在无 意识中你们对他们是很明白的。你们在无意识中看到了你们破坏性倾向的形象， 而这些形象本身唤醒你们与之抗争。</td></tr><tr><td>Looking back, you can say that this effect was therapeutic, but if you had subconsciously accepted the images it would have marked the beginning of a severe deterioration for you both personally and creatively.Again, the images marked the critical culmination of your destructive energies.The fact that the images were of yourselves shows that your destruction was turned inward even though materialized in the outer world.</td><td>回顾过去，你可以说这种效应是有疗愈作用的，但是如果你们下意识地接受了这 些形象，这将标志着你们在个人和创造性方面严重恶化的开始。同样，这些形象 标志着你们破坏性能量的置高点。这形象是你们自己的，这个事实说明，你们的 破坏性是向内的，纵使是在外在世界具体化。</td></tr><tr><td>Once more, your personality is creative and constructive even when it is tuned to a destructive trend.Therefore more than is normal you must be aware of this problem.The very fact that the images were so solid and real, and so vested with physical attributes shows how strong your aggressions were.</td><td>再次，你们的人格是创造性和建设性的，即使它被调整到一个破坏性的趋势。因 此你们必须比平常情况下更多地意识到这个问题。这些形象是如此具体和真实， 并具有物理属性，这一事实表明你们的好斗性是多么强烈。</td></tr><tr><td>Your dancing represented the first move away from what those images meant, and violent action was the best thing under the circumstances.Because your personalities were momentarily disconnected from their usual physical and psychic environment, and because the ordinary physical duties were not necessary, it was all the more easy for you to release these energies into the formation of the images you saw.However, you very nearly drained your energy reserve in forming these images.The energy you used dancing came from psychic reserves, saved subconsciously for emergency.</td><td>你们的舞步代表着远离这些形象的第一个举动，在这种情况下，激烈地运动是最 好的方法。因为如此一来，你们的人格会暂时地从自己平时的身体和灵性环境中 脱离，因为普通的体力劳动是不必要的，所以你们更容易将这些能量释放到你们 看到的形象的形成中。然而，在形成这些形象时，你也几乎耗尽了你储备的能量。而跳舞的能量来自于灵性储备，是下意识地保存以备不时之需。</td></tr><tr><td>Jane was literally though unknowingly kicking her heels in the faces of the images you had created.You are lucky that the images themselves did not rise up and fight back, since the image fragments have all the powers of their parents, though they may be latent.</td><td>珍实际上是不自觉地把她的高跟鞋踢到了你们所创造的形象的面前。你们很幸 运，形象本身没有起身反击，因为它们具有亲本的所有力量，尽管它们可能是潜 在的。</td></tr><tr><td>A subtle transformation could have taken place.Such a thing is far from usual but possible, in which you and Jane transferred the bulk of your personalities into the fragments you had yourselves created.Jane's intuition here was right.The images did represent a possible variation.You could have actually transferred yourselves to those images, and from their eyes watched yourselves across the room.In this case, your present dominant personalities would no longer be dominant.</td><td>一种微妙的转变可能已经发生了。这样的事情远非寻常，但却是可能的，在这种 情况下，你和珍将你们大部分人格转移到你们自己创造的这个片段中。珍的直觉 在这里是正确的。这些形象确实代表了可能的变化。你们可能真的把自己转移到 了这些形象中，并从他们的眼睛看到了房间对面的自己。在这种情况下，你们现 在的主导人格将不再是主导的。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take another break.</td><td>我建议你们再休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:30.This York Beach dancing establishment was actually a ground floor room in one of the older beach hotels there.It was a rectangular room, lined with tables and chairs in rows.The ceiling was very low, and it was dimly lit.It was not a large room, and the dance floor was quite small; fifteen couples would be forced to stand elbow to elbow.The bandstand was at the end of the dance floor, and when the trumpet blared the noise was deafening.Both times we were there, it was very crowded, blue with smoke.</td><td>(10:30 休息。这个约克海滨的舞池，实际上是那里的一个老式海滨旅馆的底层房间。这是一个长方形的房间，摆放着一排排桌椅。天花板非常低，灯光昏暗。这个房间不大，舞池相当小；15 对夫妇将被迫肘挨着肘的站着。演奏台在舞池的尽头，喇叭声震耳欲聋。我们去的那两次都非常拥挤，烟雾缭绕。</td></tr><tr><td>(The couple in question sat at a table for two directly in front of the bandstand; a most peculiar spot, I recall thinking, for an older pair who did not smile, did not dance, who caught our eyes occasionally, who did not seem to care about the drinks before them.I also recall that at the end of our stay there, Jane pointed out to me the fact that they were smiling.This was after we had been dancing for a while. Part of the time while dancing, we had been so close to their table we probably touched it.Truly, we had kicked up our heels in their faces.-Jane resumed dictation at about 10:40.</td><td>(说的这对夫妻，坐在乐队台前的一张双人桌旁；我记得我在想，这是个很特别 的位置，因为这对老夫妇没有笑容，不跳舞，偶尔与我们的目光相遇，似乎对他 们面前的饮料并不在意。我还记得，当我们在那里的逗留结束时，珍向我指出他 们都在微笑的事实。这是在我们跳了一段时间的舞之后。在跳舞的时候，我们曾 一度离他们的桌子很近，可能都碰到桌子了。真的，我们把高跟鞋踢到了他们的 脸上。珍 10:40 继续传述。</td></tr><tr><td>("Seth, who left the dance hall firstâJane and I, or the projected fragments?")</td><td>("赛斯，谁先离开了舞厅，珍和我，还是那些投射的片段？")</td></tr><tr><td>The projected fragments disappeared.They stood up, walked across the floor and disappeared in the crowd in the anteroom by the door.They had no power to leave the place where they were born, unless you gave it to them.Remember, however, that they did exist; and having once existed could reappear with less impetus than the original.As Joseph represents the fullest potentiality of your entity the image of the man represents a possible, though I hope not probable, pitfall image of your present personality, though not of your overall entity.</td><td>投射片段消失了。他们站起来，走过舞池，消失在门边前厅的人群中。除非你给 他们力量，否则他们没有力量离开他们出生的地方。但是请记住，他们确实存 在；并且一旦存在，就能够用比原来更小的动力重新出现。由于约瑟代表了你的 存有之最充分的潜能，那个人的形象代表了你现在的人格的一个可能的，虽然我 不希望是，有缺陷的形象，尽管不是你的整体存有。</td></tr><tr><td>That image is only connected with your present personality ego, and could be likened to a fibrous projection or growth, into which your present personality could become entombed.I use the word purposely to show the danger, because such an occurrence would be a setback, not only to your present personality but indirectly for your entity, since you would be further away from it than you are now.By the same token, your triumph represented a necessary one, and reinforced the healthy points of your present ego.</td><td>这个形象只与你现在的人格自我有关，可以比喻为一个纤维状的投射或增生，你 的当前人格可能会被埋入其中。我特意用这个词来表明它的危险性，因为这样情 况的发生将是一种倒退，不仅是对你当前的人格，它也间接地对你的存有，因为 你会比现在更远离你的存有。同样的道理，你的胜利代表了一个必要的胜利，并 加强了你当前自我的健康点。</td></tr><tr><td>("What is the personal significance of the drawing of the old woman I am now working on, in egg tempera?"</td><td>("我正在画的蛋彩画，画了一个老妇人，这有什么个人意义？"</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane dictates:) The old woman was the mother.The drawing represents a synthesis of the knowledge that you learned during that personality.The knowledge of the mother lingers in the mental genes, and the memory of the flesh still occurs in your physical genes.That which is, is never blotted out.Another drawing of a woman and a baby also represents you as a young mother with a child.</td><td>(珍传述:)这个老妇人是位母亲。这幅画代表你在那次人格期间学到的知识的综合。母亲的知识萦绕在精神基因中，而肉体的记忆仍然发生在你的身体基因 中。一切所是，永远不会被抹去。另一幅女人和婴儿的画，也代表了你身为一个 带着孩子的年轻母亲。</td></tr><tr><td>Neither of you have a need for children in your present personalities. You are almost finished with incarnations on the earth, so much so that the physical bodies will return completely and unfragmented upon your physical death.This is always the case in the final earth life.The physical property is left behind, no portion of it being carried on that plane through children.</td><td>你们俩的当前人格都没有对孩子的需要，你们几乎完成了地球上的转世，以至于 在你们肉体死亡时，肉体将完全返回，没有任何破损。地球上的最后一世总是这 样。肉体性质的任何部分，都不会通过孩子继续存留于那个层面上。</td></tr><tr><td>You are able to think in terms of immortality through your work, rather than through physical offspring, simply because your entity has known itself in terms of the flesh.Therefore you are no longer bound or drawn to it in that fashion.This is not to say that psychic love of earthly phenomenon is not with you. It is and will be.Even on other planes the sensual nature and appreciation of the earthly habitat is maintained.</td><td>你可以通过你的作品而不是透过身体的后代来思考不朽的概念，只是因为，你们 的存有已经在肉体方面认识了自己。因此，你们将不再以这种方式约束或吸引 它。这并不是说你们对世间不再持有灵性的爱，这会有，将来也会有。对尘世栖 息地的感性与欣赏，即使在其他层面也会维持下去。</td></tr><tr><td>("Seth, will you begin again on the subject of mental enzymes?I asked you to verify Jane's answer on this in the 8th session.

vested in its various personalities.The consciousness of a part of the whole could not hear the weight of the consciousness of the whole.Fragment personalities could not possibly contain the whole,

many times they bear fruit.In each life the new consciousness struggles to tie together the whole present personality, to use what is necessary from the subconscious for the good of the personality, and to keep submerged in the subconscious any knowledge that would threaten the dominancy of the present ego.</td><td>种子的力量要保持潜伏，但很多时候它们会开花结果。在每一世，新的意识都在 努力地将整个当世人格连系在一起，为了人格的利益而使用潜意识中必要的东 西，并将任何会威胁到当前自我统治地位的知识湮没在潜意识中。</td></tr><tr><td>(We rested for perhaps ten minutes.Since Jane was so tired, we decided, again, to end the session.As we sat at the board Jane received the

[Was Jane's elbow dropping, so the hand rose up?I do not know.] But laughing, Seth told us plainly that when we had attained more proficiency, he would materialize a fully independent hand for us.He explained that he drew on all three of us for the psychic energy necessary to do this. "</td><td>(现在，当珍仍然坐在那里，左手腕压在桌子上，她的手又部分变白，从桌子上 升起几英寸[据我估计可能是三英寸]。珍在我的左边，握着我的手，比尔在我的 右边，比尔把他闲着的右手放在珍的手下，看它是否真的在上升，而不是一种错 觉， [或是珍的胳膊肘下探，所以手擡起来？我不知道。]赛斯笑了一下，明确地告诉我们，当我们更熟练时，他会具体化一只完全独立的手。他解释说，他利用 我们三个人的灵性能量来做这件事。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's hand returned to the table and resumed again its paw like shape."Now," Seth said to me, "very carefully, reach out and touch the hand.I want you to carefully touch it so that you will see what it is like." I touched my fingertips to Jane's palm.The hand, paw like, club like, felt very cold to me, wet and clammy, and the skin had a bumpy feeling that I was not used to in Jane's hand. "</td><td>(珍的手回到了桌子上，又恢复了它爪子一般的形状。"现在"，赛斯对我说， "非常小心地伸出手来，触摸那只手。我想让你小心地触摸它，这样你就会看到 它是什么样子。" 我的指尖触到了珍的手掌。这只手，梅花状、像爪子，我感觉很凉，湿漉漉的，一种我完全不熟悉的粗糙感。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth then had the cold inner light suffuse Jane's wrist and palm toä¸æan even more remarkable degree.At the joining of hand and wrist, the flesh rose up in an egg like lump; the light crept up Jane's arm to her sweater, and bled down her fingers until all semblance of shadow was gone.Then, to end this part of the demonstration, Seth had Jane place her hands side by side so that we could plainly see the difference between the two.It was easily seen. "</td><td>(赛斯然后让冰冷的内光充斥着珍的手腕和手掌，达到一个更显著的程度。在手 掌和手腕的连接处，肉呈鸡蛋状隆起；光从珍的手臂爬到她的毛衣，并顺着她的 手指流下，直到所有的影子都消失。然后，为了结束这一部分的演示，赛斯让珍 把她的手并排放在一起，以便我们能清楚地看到两者之间的区别。这很容易看出 来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Gradually, Jane's left hand returned to normal; we then took a break at Seth's bidding. "</td><td>(渐渐地，珍的左手恢复正常；然后我们在赛斯的指示下休息片刻。</td></tr><tr><td>(I would estimate that a good hour was taken up by the above proceedings.Usually the changes in shape and color took place quite slowly.Our interest was of course intense the whole time.We did exactly as Seth told us to; often, for instance, I wanted to reach out and grasp Jane's hand while it was in metamorphosis, but I did not touch it until Seth said to.During the whole time, Jane-Seth spoke constantly.The dialogue, while unmistakably Seth, had the added fillips of an almost macabre wit and a biting sarcasm.Often Seth remarked upon our rather childish desire for demonstrations; yet when I asked him if he would rather we refrained from such requests in the future, he said he understood the desire, that it was natural, and that if he felt like it he would comply. "</td><td>(据我估计，上述过程花了一个多小时。通常情况下，形状和颜色的变化发生得 相当缓慢。当然，我们的兴趣在整个过程中都很强烈。我们完全按照赛斯的吩咐去做；例如，当珍的手在变形时，我常常想伸手去抓它，但我没有碰它，直到赛斯说可以。在整个过程中，珍-赛斯不断地说话。这些对话，虽然明确无误地是赛 斯的，但却增加了一种几乎可怕的机智和尖锐的讽刺。赛斯经常说，我们想要他演示的想法很幼稚；然而当我问他是否希望我们今后不要提出这样的要求时，他说他理解这种愿望，这很自然，如果他有兴致，他会照办。</td></tr><tr><td>(We had turned no lights on during break.Now Seth rather imperiously commanded us to move our little table over a few feet so that it faced the doorway to our bathroom.Looking back, Jane, Bill, and I recall with some humor that we docilely followed Seth's every order.The three of us sat shoulder to shoulder, staring into the bath, which is large and tiled with white.We were hoping to see a materialization of some kind in the open doorway, since we had discussed this at break. "</td><td>(我们在休息时没有开灯。现在赛斯相当不客气地命令我们把我们的小桌子移过 去几英尺，使它面对着我们浴室的门口。回头想想，珍、比尔、我，好笑地记得，我们温顺地遵循着赛斯的每一个命令。我们三个人肩并肩地坐着，盯着浴缸，浴缸很大，铺着白色瓷砖。我们希望能在敞开的门口看到某种物质化的东西，因为我们在休息时讨论过这个问题。</td></tr><tr><td>("This isn't a lunch meeting," Seth snapped at me through Jane, for I was still finishing a piece of candy."Nor is it a circus session.Your bathroom is much too light for what you desire.White is a very poor color for what you are asking." When I asked if he required total darkness to he at his best, he replied, "We make light from darkness. "</td><td>("这不是午餐会，"赛斯通过珍对我呵斥道，因为我正在吃一块糖。"这也不 是马戏团的课。对于你的愿望来说，你的浴室太亮了。对于你所要求，白色是一 个非常不好的颜色"。当我问他是否需要完全的黑暗才能达到最佳状态时，他回 答说："我们从黑暗中创造光"。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth then ordered us to shut the bathroom door.The living room side of the door holds a full-length mirror.</td><td>(然后，赛斯命令我们关上浴室的门。朝向客厅的门装有穿衣镜。</td></tr><tr><td>("Now," Seth said, "look into the mirror." The red candle was still on, though hidden behind the curtains.Since the mirror is tall and narrow, we had to crowd in close on three sides of the little table, in order to see our reflections.But we could pick them out.Jane sat in the middle.Her lips were very close to my ear as she talked now; I could hear and feel each breath she took, each swallow she took; her voice dropped considerably in volume and I had the sensation that she was indeed speaking for someone else.</td><td>("现在，"赛斯说，"看着镜子"。红蜡烛灯仍然亮着，但隐藏在窗帘后面。由于镜子又高又窄，我们不得不挤在小桌子的三边，才能看到镜中的我们。但 是，我们可以看出谁是谁。珍坐在中间。她现在说话时嘴唇离我的耳朵很近；我 能听到和感觉到她的每一次呼吸，她的每一次吞咽；她的声音大幅度下降，我感 觉到她确实是在为别人说话。</td></tr><tr><td>("Now the three of you see your reflections in the mirror, just as you should. . .

constructed, so that looking through them there would seem to be no beginning or end.Your plane could be likened to a small position between four very spindly and thin wires, and my plane could be likened to the small position in the neighboring wires on the other side.Yet not only are we on different sides of the same wires, but we are at the same time either above or below, according to your viewpoint, and if you consider the wires as forming cubesâthis is for you, Joseph, with your love of imagesâthen the cubes could also fit one within the other without disturbing the inhabitants of either cube one iota; and these cubes are also within cubes, which are themselves within cubes, and I am speaking now of only the small particle of space taken up by your plane and mine.</td><td>那么，请想象一个有点像珍的《理念建构》的电线网络，但又有所不同，一个由无休止的互锁电线构成的迷宫，看过去似乎没有开始或结束。你们的层面，可以被比喻为四个非常细小的电线*(译注:wire 此处译为电线是带电的线之意，旨在呼应日后赛斯所谈之 EE 单位"EE units (electromagnetic),"的概念。另有译本译为金属丝线)之间的一个小位置，而我的层面，可以被比喻为另一边的邻近电线中的小位 置。然而，我们不仅在同一根电线的不同侧面，而且根据你的观点，我们同时在上面或下面，如果你认为这些电线形成了立方体- 这只是对你说的，约瑟，以你对图像的热爱 -那么这些立方体，也可以在不干扰任何一个立方体的居民的情况下，一个接一个；而且这些立方体也在立方体中，它们本身也在立方体中，我现 在说的，只是你和我的层面所占空间的小颗粒。</td></tr><tr><td>Again now think merely in terms of your plane, bounded by its small spindly set of wires, and my

through each other constantly.</td><td>现在再想一想，你们的层面被它的小线组所束缚，而我的层面在另一边。正如我所说的，这些也有无边的一致性[solidarity]和深度，但在通常情况下，一方是透明 的，另一方也是透明的。你无法看透，但这两个层面在不断地相互移动。</td></tr><tr><td>I hope you see what I have done here.I have initiated the idea of motion, for true transparency is not the ability to see through but to move through.This is what I mean by fifth dimension.Now, remove the structure of the wires and cubes.Things behave as though the wires and cubes were there, but these were only constructions necessary even to those on my plane in order to make things comprehensible to our faculties, the faculties of any entity.We construct images consistent with the senses we happen to have at a particular time.I have more senses, so to speak, in operating use that is, than you have, because not only

apparent walls of the room.Again the idea of transparency.The walls are truly transparent to me though I am not sure I would perform, dear Joseph, and Ruburt, for a party demonstration.</td><td>我们只是构建了想像中的线条来行走。你房间的墙壁构造是如此真实，以至于没 有它们你会在冬天冻僵，然而没有房间也没有墙壁。因此，以同样的方式，我们 构建的电线在宇宙中对我们来说是真实的，尽管没有电线。一切都是一体的，正 如你与房间的表面墙壁是一体的。再次地，这是透明的概念。墙壁对我来说确实

practical purposes we must behave as if the wires are there.There are certain planes which I cannot glimpse from my viewpoint, although I have greater understanding of these things than you.I realize that the changes that must occur before I can view those other planes will occur in me, not in the other planes.Again if you will consider our maze of wires, I will ask you to imagine them filling up everything that is, with your plane and my plane like two small bird's nests in the netlike fabric of some gigantic tree.</td><td>然而对我来说，墙壁是透明的。为了说明我们关于第五维度的观点而建造的电线 也是透明的，但为了所有的实际目的，我们必须表现得好像这些电线就在那里。仍有一些层面，从我的角度也无法瞥见到，但我仍然比你们更理解那些层面。我 意识到，在我能够查看那些其他层面之前，必须发生的变化将发生在我身上，而 不是其他层面。如果你再次考虑我们的电线迷宫，我将要求你想像它们填满了一 切，你的层面和我的层面就像一些巨大的树的网状结构中的两个小鸟巢。</td></tr><tr><td>I

amused.You have so little conception yet of what is involved, and yet personally I found last night's session enjoyable.Your friend however really would have intruded, in a bumbling but quite domineering manner, had I so allowed him.He is like a child begging for a piece of frosty cake, and I must admit I was tempted to shove his head in the frosting.</td><td>我想我应该认为自己很幸运，你没有要求演示这棵树长到你们的客厅里。你们要 原谅我，但我并没有真正被激怒，亲爱的朋友们，对这种示范的欲望。哈，如果 一开始你不成功，那就试试，再试试。这只是因为你们是如此天真无邪，而我是 如此有趣。你们对所涉及的事情还没有什么概念，但我个人认为昨晚的课程很愉 快。然而，如果我允许的话，你的朋友真的会以一种笨拙但相当霸道的方式闯

give such lessons, but psychic bonds between teacher and pupils are necessary, which means that we must wait until personalities on your plane have progressed sufficiently for lessons to begin.To explain more clearly, lessons are conducted with those who are psychically bound to us, although reason is extremely important and I do not mean to minimize its value.Nevertheless, what you call emotion or feeling is the connective between us, and it is the connective that most clearly represents the life force on any plane and under any circumstances.</td><td>在我的层面上，我们所有人或多或少都会上这样的课，但老师和学生之间的灵性 连结是必要的，这意味着我们必须等待到你们层面的人格有了足够的进展，才能 开始上课。更清楚的解释就是，课程是与那些与我们有灵性连结的人一起进行 的，虽然理性极其重要，我并不是要贬低它的价值。然而，你们所说的情感或感 觉是我们之间的联系，它是在任何层面和任何情况下，最清楚代表生命力的联 系。</td></tr><tr><td>From it is woven all material of your world and mine.If you consider the wires again, then you could view them as solidified emotion, woven together, however with a strong cohesive and stiffening power of the intellect.With feeling alone, although it is the basis, you would have an inconsistent, very precarious framework.Reason is the form that disciplines and upholds these frameworks.</td><td>你们和我的世界的所有物质都是由它织成的。如果你再想一想这些电线，那么你 可以把它们看作是凝固的情感，交织在一起，然而有一种强大的凝聚力和智力的 坚挺力量。仅凭感觉，尽管它是基础，你会有一个不一致的、非常不稳定的架 构。理性是约束和维护这些架构的形式。</td></tr><tr><td>At a later date I will go in even further into this fifth dimension.You consider for example that these wires are also mobile, constantly trembling, and also live, in that they not only carry the stuff of the universe but are themselves projections of this stuff, and you will see how difficult it is to explain.Nor can I blame you for growing tired, when after asking you to imagine this strange structure I then insist that you tear it apart, for it is no more actually seen or touched than is the buzzing of a million invisible bees.</td><td>在以后的日子里，我将进一步深入到这个第五维度。比如说，电线也是移动的， 不断颤动，也是活的，因为它们不仅携带着宇宙的东西，而且本身就是这些东西

around.</td><td>你们想自己尝试任何想做的实验都是无可厚非的，没什么损失，也许收获更多。喜欢就叫它家庭作业吧。也许，我甚至会给你一颗金星，然而，以我对妳们的认 识，你们会坚持认为老师会把众所周知的苹果给学生，而不是相反。</td></tr><tr><td>In any case I wish you the best of luck in whatever experiments

that it renews contact in a familiar manner, and also I have always been partial to formality to some extent.The board gives us each a breathing spell, and is a method of saying good day or good evening or tipping one's hat.I'm also of the opinion that small ritual tends to emphasize data in the mind, and set it off to advantage, in the same way that good cuisine is set off by fine dishes.</td><td>显灵板是一个形式上的问题，实际上非常重要，因为它以一种熟悉的方式重新进 行接触，而且我在某种程度上总是偏爱形式。显灵板给了我们每个人一个喘息的 机会，并且，也是一种打招呼的方法，如同说日安、晚安或轻提帽沿致意那样。我也认为，一个小小的仪式会有强化头脑中资讯的倾向，并将其衬托得更有优

concept and as yet you do not have the necessary background.</td><td>从某种意义上来说，具有那种性质的任何颜色或品质都可被认为是一种精神酵 素。举例来说，在精神和物质之间有某种交换，如果不是这样，颜色将不存在。现在，我首先用色彩作为例子，也许是因为，如何把它理解成为精神酵素，比把 叶绿素理解成为同样的事情更容易被理解。叶绿素是绿色，但它不仅只是颜色而 已。(停顿)这里存在一种互动，不过，这也确定了叶绿素的本质。(停顿)这 是最难解释的术语之一。我希望能说得让你对它更清楚一些，但它涉及到一个更 大的概念，而目前你对这概念还没有必要的背景知识。</td></tr><tr><td>("What can you tell us about Jane's recitation the

请仔细听好 - 并且也是行动本身。(*注:此处行动 action 是那本能的，自发的，动的状态) 换句话说，精神酵素不仅在物质世界引起行动，并且成为行动本身。从这里开始，我会一直把物化称为行动，因为你们现在都知道没有什么是静止的。如果你能读完以上三、四 段，你就会越来越清楚地看到精神和物质成为一体的地方。</td></tr><tr><td>You both know again what love and hate are, but as I told you before try to think in new ways.Love and hate for example are action.They are both action and they both imply action in physical bodies, and even as far as thoughts are concerned.In your plane action is the main word of importance.</td><td>你们都知道什么是爱和恨，但正如我之前告诉你们的那样，试着用新的方式思 考。例如，爱和恨都是行动。它们都是行动，它们都意味着在肉体中的行动，甚 至就思想而言也是如此。在你们的层面上，行动(action)是最重要的词。</td></tr><tr><td>These mental enzymes, to go back to them, are solidified feeling but not in the term again that you usually think of.I see I will have to try to give you a better definition of feeling or we will get into trouble.</td><td>再回头谈精神酵素，精神酵素就是固化的情感(feeling)，但还是那句话，不是你 通常认为的那种术语。我看，我最好是对感觉这词，为你提供一个更好的定义， 否则我们会说不清楚。</td></tr><tr><td>Let the definition go for a moment however while I make this one point.I have said that our imaginary wires that seem to permeate our model universe are alive, and now if you will bear with me I will say that they are mental enzymes or solidified feelings, always of course in motion and yet permanent enough to form a more or less consistent framework.(Pause. ) You could almost say that mental enzymes become the tentacles which form material, though I do not find that a very pleasant phrase.</td><td>暂把定义摆一边，我先解说一个观点。我已经说过，我们的想像线似乎渗透到了 我们的模型宇宙中，是有生命的，现在，稍安勿躁，我要说，它们就是精神酵素 或固化情感，当然总是在运动中，但又足够持久，以形成一个或多或少一致的架 构。(停顿)尽管，我没有找到一个非常贴切的短语，但你几乎可以说，精神酵 素成为了形成物质的触须。</td></tr><tr><td>The framework is only for convenience, as your walls are for your convenience as I mentioned earlier.The walls are not there as such, but you had better act as if they were or suffer a possible broken neck.I must still respect many like frameworks in my own plane, but my understanding of them renders them less opaqueâand that is a poor wordâall the time.</td><td>这个架构仅仅是为了方便，就像我前面提到的，你们的墙壁也是为了你们的方便 一样。墙壁并不是真的在那里，但你最好表现得像它们是存在的，否则有可能撞 断脖子。在我自己的层面，我也仍然必须尊重很多类似的架构，但由于我对这些 架构的理解，使它们显得较透明 -- 这是一句很蹩脚的话。</td></tr><tr><td>Intellectual truth alone will not make you free, though it is certainly a necessary preliminary.If this were the case your walls would fall away, since intellectually you understand their rather dubious nature.Since feeling is so often the cohesive with which mind builds, it is feeling itself which must be changed if you would find freedom from your particular plane of existence at your particular time.That is, to some extent a change in feeling will allow you to see variants.Since feeling is a cohesive, to change it completely would hardly be of any advantage since your world of present existence would fall apart.</td><td>仅仅是智力上的真理并不能使你自由，尽管它肯定是一个必要的初步。如果是这 样的话，你的墙就会掉下来，因为在智力上你了解它们相当可疑的性质。感觉往 往才是心智赖以创建的凝聚力，如果你想在你的特定时间从你的特定存在层面中 找到自由，必须改变的是感觉本身。也就是说，在某种程度上，感觉的改变会让 你看到差异变化。由于感觉是一种凝聚力，因此要完全改变它几乎没有任何好处，因为你现在的存在世界会崩溃。</td></tr><tr><td>I will at a later date try to discuss the question of time.Any of these discussions are of necessity of a simple and uncomplicated nature.If I speak in analogies and images it is because I must relate with the world that is familiar to you.</td><td>以后我会设法讨论有关时间的问题。所有这类的讨论都必须具有简单而不复杂的 性质。如果我用比喻和图象来说明，那是因为我必须要连结你所熟悉的世界。</td></tr><tr><td>("Seth, how many worlds do we remember within?"</td><td>("赛斯，我们记得多少个内在世界？")</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane dictates:) Your question leaves much to be desired.I am not certain if you refer to the subconscious memory of personality, the conscious memory of personality, or of the memory of an entity.The entity of course represents and is aware of the lives of all its personalities.</td><td>(珍传述:)你这问题有很多不足之处。我不确定你是指人格的潜意识记忆、人格的有意识记忆或是一个存有的记忆。存有当然代表并觉知它所有人格生命的每 一世。</td></tr><tr><td>You on your plane for example do not even have conscious memory of your own dream fragments.For that matter you can hardly remember one idea from one week to another on a conscious deliberate basis.It is simply impossible for the ego as you know it to maintain conscious dominance at this time.(Pause. )</td><td>举例来说，在你们自己的层面上，你甚至对自己的梦境片段都没有有意识的记 忆。正因为如此，你很难在有意识的基础上记住从一个星期到另一个星期的一个 想法。在这个时候，你所知道的自我根本不可能保持有意识的主导地位。(停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that this session come to a conclusion.I hesitate to give you an excess of data on Monday when our next session is on a Wednesday.You need time to digest the material, and this material is difficult on the digestion.In any case you bear with me very well, and I can say the same for myself.</td><td>我认为，本节课应该结束了。我不愿意在星期一给你过多的资料，而我们的下一 次课程是在星期三。你需要时间来消化这些资料，而这些资料是很难消化的。无 论如何，你们对我非常包容，我也可以对自己说同样的话。</td></tr><tr><td>Good night, but do touch hands to the board.</td><td>晚安，但一定要把手触摸到显灵板上。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane and I sat at the board, hands on the pointer.We moved it to the word good-bye.</td><td>(珍和我坐在显灵板的旁边，双手放在指针上。我们把它挪到再见这个词上。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth.

She sensed his deep and personal inner awareness.It confused and haunted him, since his inarticulateness applied also to thoughts within himself.He felt strongly but could not explain.In his solitary nature he came close to being a mystic but he was unable to relate his personality as Joseph Burdo with the social world at large, or even to the other members of his family.There was a block, regrettably.He felt strongly his connection with the universe as a whole and with nature as he understood it.But to him nature did not include his fellow human beings.The solitariness that besieged himâbecause it did besiege himâis dangerous to any personality unless it comes after identification with the human race.</td><td>除了正常的原因之外(珍传述:)他有偏于灵性的倾向，在珍小的时候，在她自己 更接近某个前世的时候，她感觉到他深刻而个人的内在觉知。由于他的不擅表达也作用到了他内心的想法，这令他困惑和烦恼。他有强烈的感觉，却无法解释。孤独的本性使他几乎成为神秘主义者，但他无法把他自己身为约瑟·波多的人格， 与整体社会，甚至他的家庭其他成员相连接。遗憾的是，这里有一个障碍。他强烈地感觉到自己与宇宙作为一个整体的连接，以及与他所理解的自然之间的连接。但是对他来说，大自然并不包括他的人类同胞。困扰他的孤独感 - 因为它确实困扰着他 - 对任何人格来说都是危险的，除非是先与人类认同之后。</td></tr><tr><td>(By now as usual Jane was pacing back and forth as she dictated.)</td><td>(现在，珍在传述时，像往常一样来回踱步。)</td></tr><tr><td>That is, in his feeling of unity with All That Is, he excluded other human beings, and on your plane it is necessary for the personality to relate to them.Only after such relation is isolation of that nature of benefit.Jane sensed her grandfather's feeling of identification with the rest of nature however, and since she had not yet developed a strong ego personality as a young child she felt no sense of rejection as did, for example, the other members of the family.When he spoke of wind she felt like wind, as any child will unselfconsciously identify with the elements.</td><td>就是说，在他与一切万有[All That Is]合一的感觉中，他排斥了其他人类的存在， 而在你们的层面上，人格有必要与他们发生关系。只有在这种关系之后，那种性 质的孤立才有好处。然而，珍可以感知到外公与人类以外的自然界的认同感，因 为身为一个小孩，珍还没有发展出强烈的自我人格，所以她没有像其他家庭成员 那样有受到排斥的感觉。当他说到风，她就感觉像风一样，因为任何孩子都会不 自觉地与这些自然元素认同。</td></tr><tr><td>He responded to his own attraction for her and was able to expand in her direction because she was not an adult.He was essentially childlike in one manner and yet he had little use for most people.Had he lived to see Jane mature the feeling between them might well have dissipated.(Joseph Burdo died in 1948 at the age of 68. Jane was 19.) He could not relate to another adult, and when in his eyes she joined the league of adulthood he would not have been able to retain his strong leaning toward her.</td><td>他对自己对她的吸引力做出了回应，并且能够向她的方向扩展，因为她不是一个 成年人。在某种程度上他像孩子一样，但对大多数人来说这孩子气毫无用处。如 果他活到珍长大成熟，他们之间的感觉很可能会消散。(约瑟·波多于 1948 年去世，享年 68 岁，珍那时是 19 岁。)他无法与另一个成年人交往，在他的眼中当珍进入成人世界后，他将无法保持对她的强烈依恋。</td></tr><tr><td>He never forgave his own children for growing up, nor did he forgive his wife for tending to earthly ways.Yet he related his own body, at least until the very end, very well with nature.He considered that he aged as a tree will age, but perversely he felt that others aged to spite him.</td><td>他从来没有原谅自己的孩子长大，也从不原谅妻子倾向于世俗的方式。然而，至 少直到最后他都将自己的身体与自然有着很好的连结。他认为自己像树木一样会 衰老，但反常的是，他觉得别人衰老是为了惹恼他。</td></tr><tr><td>It was an unfortunate defect in the personality.The psychic nature grew in an oddly distorted manner in some aspects and yet remained stubbornly shrunken in others.From early age however Jane drank in his feeling of completeness with nature, and it had much to do with her later development.She now displays in some instances her grandfathers closed attitude toward people.At times both you and Jane reinforce each other along these lines.</td><td>这是人格上的一个不幸的缺陷。灵性的本质在某些面向中以一个古怪、扭曲的方 式成长，而在其他的面向则又顽固地萎缩着。然而，从很小的时候起，珍就沉浸 在她外公与自然完整合一的感觉，这与她后来的发展息息相关。她现在，在某些 情况下也表现出她外公对人的封闭态度。有时，你和珍也相互加强了彼此的这些 面向。</td></tr><tr><td>You must of course use discipline in personal relationships, but you must have personal relationships, as I think you are beginning to learn.You have both expanded in that direction and that is good.</td><td>当然，在人际关系中你们必须有所自律，但你们必须有人际关系，我想你们已经 开始学会了。你们都朝着这个方向扩展，这很好。</td></tr><tr><td>Such relationships, disciplined of course, will nevertheless yield richness for both of you that neither of you would get in any other manner.You do not have to take hordes into your house. On the other hand all stages of relationships are necessary, and a casual give and take between you and friends will expand your spirit in ways that neither you nor Jane personally can do alone.I am going into this matter because it has concerned both of you at various times, and I would like to state that your work will not suffer by expending energy in these other directions.</td><td>当然，这种有纪律的人际关系，将会为你俩带来用任何其他方式都不能带来的丰 裕。你不必把成群的人带进家里，另一方面，所有阶段的关系都是必要的，你们和朋友之间的宽容互动会以你和珍无法单独做的方式扩展你们的灵[Spirit]。我之所以要讨论这个问题，是因为它在不同时期都与你们两个人有关，我想说的是， 你们的工作不会因为在这些其他方向上耗费精力而受到影响。</td></tr><tr><td>I am speaking now of disciplined relationships.When you avoid them or attempt to avoid them you both do so out of fear.Your personalities, work habits and goals are well set and secure enough not to be threatened in such a manner.You also Joseph have much to offer other individuals and through giving you yourself will grow.</td><td>我现在说的是有纪律的关系。当你们避开他们或试图避开他们时，你们都是出于 恐惧。你们的个性、工作习惯和目标都已设定好，足够安全，不会受到这样的威 胁。你，约瑟，也有很多东西可以提供给其他个人，通过给予，你们自己也会成 长。</td></tr><tr><td>Keep your regular work habits intact.I know I need not tell you this, far be it from me when I know your habits so well.When you were worldly you were the fleshiest man I knew.Now in your compensation you show the same tenacity of purpose.</td><td>保持你正常的工作习惯。当我如此了解你的习惯时，我就不会这样做了。当你是 俗人的时候，你是我所知最纵于声色的人。而今你矫枉过正，对生命的目标报以 同等的韧劲执着。</td></tr><tr><td>Your isolation during working hours becomes even more precious and more constructive when contrasted with periods given to friends, as sweet is sweeter when bitter is on the tongue.You forget also that because of your makeup all your experiences are translated into your work, and work becomes play and play becomes work.</td><td>如同舌头上沾了苦味时，甜味会变得更甜，你在工作时间的孤立，与给予朋友的 时段相比，也变得更加珍贵和更具建设性。你还忘了，由于你们的性格，你们所 有的经历都被转化为工作，工作成为了游戏，游戏变成了工作。</td></tr><tr><td>As to your jottings this morning concerning art, very good, I commend you.You are already beginning to think in new and wider concepts.As your paintings are solidified feeling on board or paper, apparent in the physical universe and therefore vulnerable to the laws of that universe, so is the universe itself on your plane physical materialized feeling, only with more dimension than a drawing or a painting.</td><td>今早，你对有关艺术所做的简短笔记，非常好，我赞赏你。你已经开始在新的和 更广泛的概念中思考。就像你的画作是画板或画纸上的固化情感，在物质宇宙中 是显而易见的，因此容易受到该宇宙规律的影响，同样的，在你们层面上，宇宙 自身也是物理具体化的情感，只不过比一张图或一幅画有更多维度。</td></tr><tr><td>There is however also an extra dimension in a painting than people usually recognize, beside the lines and color and form and content, which are as you said so aptly feeling solidified.You have the action of which you also spoke.First you have the action of the lines, form and content and so forth, caught and solidified, then as an observer looks at a painting feeling is again motion moving out from the painting into the beholder's perception.</td><td>但是，除了 线条，颜色，形式和内容之外，绘画中还有一个比人们通常认识到的更多的维 度，就是你说得相当贴切的情感的固化。还有你谈到的行动。首先，你有画出线 条、形式和内容等等的行动，这些行动都被捕捉并被固化，然后当观察者看一幅 画时，这时，情感再次成为行动从画中移出，进入观察者的感受中。</td></tr><tr><td>As for your straight lines and curves you realize, I know, that there are really no straight lines and curves, but that they are symbols.Otherwise your dissertation was excellent.Action is solidified, or should I say transfixed, in a painting and yet even in a painting action is never really solidified or transfixed, but continually fluid.</td><td>至于你的直线和曲线，我知道，你了解其实没有所谓的直线和曲线，它们都只是 符号。否则的话，你的论述是非常出色的。在绘画中，行动是被固化的，或者我 应该说是被固定的，但是即使是在一幅画中，行动也从未真正被固化或固定，而 是持续不断地流动。</td></tr><tr><td>As far as the ink sketch is concerned, do not forget that while your man was imprisoned by his senses, in trying to reach beyond them in your physical universe your man could not perceive anything at all; and yet it is through these very earthy senses that he has a chance to glimpse beyond, or indeed realize that there is a beyond to glimpse.</td><td>就水墨素描而言，不要忘记，在你们人类正受困于自己的感官而试图在物质宇宙 中超越这些感官的期间，你们人类根本无法感知任何东西；然而，正是通过这些非常尘世的感官，人类才有机会瞥见那超越的境界，或者确实意识到是有个超越 的层面可以被瞥见。</td></tr><tr><td>Perception of beauty through the senses is the trigger on your plane for subsequent inner perceptions.The two are so closely bound, through music for example, which can only be appreciated through the senses.Psychic actions take place which lead the individual beyond the senses.There is much more to be said here.There is a phrase which I will explain at a later dateâinner sensesâwhich you will find extremely interesting.By this I mean senses within the senses.I would use behind the senses but I believe this would lead to confusion.</td><td>在你们层面，感官对美的感知，是后续内在感知的触发点。这两者是如此紧密相 连。例如，只能经由感官来欣赏的音乐，随后导致个人发生超越感官的灵性行 动。这里要说的太多了。这里有一个短语 - 内在感官 - 我以后会解释，你会发现它非常有趣。我的意思是感官内的感官。我也可以用背后的感官，但我认为这会 导致混乱。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you break.Quietly however, do not crash into pieces.</td><td>我建议休息。然而，要静静地，不要溃不成军。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:50.To date the above monologue is the longest answer we have received.During its delivery Jane talked at a steady rate, just slow enough for me to be able to take it down word for word in longhand.Shorthand would be a great help.During this dictation Jane neither stopped, speeded up, backtracked gave any indication of confusion, stopped or started anew.</td><td>(9:50。迄今为止，上述独白是我们收到的最长的答案。珍在传述过程中以平稳 的速度说话，缓慢的程度足以让我能够逐字记录下来。速记将大有帮助。在传述 过程中，珍既没有停下来，也没有加速，更没有倒退，也没有表现出任何混乱、 停止或重新开始。</td></tr><tr><td>(The reader will note that I did not ask Seth to comment on my writings concerning art, but that the subject came up during the monologue.I had given Jane my copy to read earlier in the day.We wondered if this method of acquainting both of us with involved questions before the session began might not save asking the question during the session itself.</td><td>(读者会注意到，我没有要求赛斯对我有关艺术的著作发表评论，但是这个话题 在赛斯的独白中提出了。稍早时我把那篇文章拿给珍看。我们想，这种在课前先 熟悉所要涉及问题的方法，是不是可以省去在课程中提出问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(After break Jane promptly began dictating again.Resume at 10:05.)</td><td>(休息后，珍迅速地再次开始传述。10:05。)</td></tr><tr><td>Everything on your plane is a materialization of something that exists independent of your plane.Therefore within your senses there are other senses that perceive inward.Your regular senses perceive, or as Jane would like to say create, an outer world.The senses within them, that is within the recognizable senses, perceive and create an inner world, they perceive part of an inner world.This is difficult for me to explain to you.However as your regular senses are limited according to the plane which you inhabitâin your case dear friends on your plane extremely limited, I'm afraidâso are the corresponding inner senses limited.</td><td>你们层面的一切事物都是某种独立存在于你们层面之外的东西的物质化。因此， 在你们的感官之内，还有一些向内感知的感官。你们平常的感官感知外部世界， 或者如珍想说的，创造外部的世界。在能辨识的感官之内有内在感官，这些内在 感官也感知并创造着一个内在世界，它们感知内在世界的一部分。我很难向你们 解释。然而，正如你们平常的感官，根据你们所居住的层面而受到限制--在你们 的情况下，亲爱的朋友们，在你们的层面上更是有限，相应的内在感官也是有限 的。</td></tr><tr><td>It is almost as if you could see, feel, touch and perceive so much outwardly and feel, touch, see and perceive so much inwardly, though much more exists in all directions, of which you are necessarily ignorant.Once you exist on a particular plane you must necessarily be attuned to it while blocking out many other perceptions.(Pause. )</td><td>这几乎就像你能看到、感觉到、触摸到和感知到这么多外在的东西，你也感觉到、触摸到、看到和感知到这么多内在的东西，尽管在各个方向存在更多的东 西，但你必然不知道。一旦你存在于某个特定的层面，你必然要与之校准，同时 挡掉许多其他的感知。(停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>It is a sort of psychic focus, a concentration of awareness along certain lines.As your ability grows in relation with the environment of your plane then you can afford to look around, use the inner senses, and enlarge your scope of activity.This is only natural.Survival on a particular plane depends upon your concentration in that plane.Again, when survival is more or less satisfied by attention then you can avail yourself of the opportunity to turn your attention elsewhere.</td><td>这是一种灵性的专注，是意识在某些方面的集中。随着你的能力与你们层面环境 的关系之增长，你就有能力环顾四周，运用内在感官，并扩大你的活动范围。这 是很自然的。在一个特定层面上的存活，取决于你对该层面的专注程度。再者， 通过专注而多少满足了存活所需后，你便可以利用这个机会将注意力转移到别处。</td></tr><tr><td>The time element is something I told you I would discuss, and if my intentions are strong Ruburt at this point is growing weak.And there is a certain element of time in this statement.The material itself has not made either of you weary.Time involved, or your idea of the time involved, has.</td><td>我告诉过你，我会讨论时间因素，如果我的意图很强，那么鲁伯在这时反倒变得 越来越弱。而这句话中，就涉及有某些时间因素。这个资料本身，没让你俩中的 任何一人疲劳。所涉及的时间，或你们对所涉及时间的观念，却有。</td></tr><tr><td>On your plane no action is really simultaneous and so time instantly enters in.You mentioned yourself Josephâoh see, you can't hide anything from meâyou mentioned earlierâI'm sorry, Ruburt needs a short break.A short one, Ruburt, should suffice.</td><td>在你们层面上，没有任何行动是真正的同步发生，因此时间立刻加入了。约瑟， 你自己说过– 瞧，你什么都瞒不了我 - 您刚才说 –真抱歉，鲁伯需要休息片刻。就一下下，鲁伯，应该就够了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:25.At last break 35 minutes ago, Jane had already said that she was exhausted.Her voice by now was even rougher, and now as then I suggested that we end the session.But she wanted to continue, mainly because Seth was coming through so well.Jane resumed dictating at 10:27.)</td><td>(在 10:25 休息。在 35 分钟前的最后一次休息时，珍已经表示她很累了。她现在嗓音更加沙哑，我建议我们现在结束课程。但她想继续，主要是因为赛斯的通讯非常顺畅。珍在 10:27 继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>You mentioned earlier Joseph that you had the feeling that I could refer back to myself almost as if I could turn a later page of a book to an earlier one, and of course this is the case.</td><td>约瑟，你之前说过，您有种感觉，我可以返回到我先前的自己，就好像我可以将 一本书的后页翻到前面一样，当然，事实就是如此。</td></tr><tr><td>(I had made this remark several days ago.)</td><td>(几天前我说过这番话。)</td></tr><tr><td>To some extent though to a much lesser degree you can do this on your own plane, but in a weak fraction of a dimension.That is, you can perhaps sense or remember an earlier moment intuitively or capture an earlier moment visually as in a photograph, or audibly as in a recording.You can through motion pictures refer back to past time, capturing the visual and auditory data of a moment and even the apparent motion of its sequence.Viewing through your so marvelous televisionâhaâa historical moment for example you can refer to much that has passed.</td><td>在某种程度上，尽管程度要小得多，你们在自己的层面上也能做到，但是只能在 一个维度的弱小部分。就是说，你或许可以直觉地感知或记起一个先前的时刻， 或像在照片中看到、一段录音里听到，而抓住过去的某个时刻。你们能借由电影 重温过去的时光，捕捉瞬间的视觉和听觉资料，甚至捕捉其序列的明显动态。透 过你们奇妙的电视，比如说看一段历史事件，您们能参阅很多已经过去的时刻。</td></tr><tr><td>But this referral itself involves time.The time that you spend watching such a historic moment takes up an identical amount of time in the present.Therefore one minute of such a past referral costs you one minute of present time.Also you end up short changed.You give up your precious moment in the present but you do not have a complete moment of the past to show for it.</td><td>但是这个回顾本身涉及时间。观看这样一个历史时刻所花费的时间，在当下也占 用了相同的时间量。因此，对过去回顾一分钟也会耗掉你当前一分钟。结果你还 吃亏了。您放弃了当下的宝贵时刻，却没换来过去的完整时光。</td></tr><tr><td>Seeing for example a crowd of people, even if you yourself were among the crowd, you cannot experience the feeling that you were experiencing when the picture was taken, and though you may see before you the pictures of people who stood in that crowd, neither you nor they can see or experience the emotions that they felt.There is much more to be said here.I must move into these things slowly.</td><td>例如，看着照片中的一群人，即使你自己也身在其中，你也无法体验当初拍照时 你正经历的感觉，纵使你眼前能见到照片中站着的那些人，但你和他们都无法看 到或体验到他们的情绪。这里还有更多要说的。我必须慢慢道来。</td></tr><tr><td>When I refer back to myself or back to what I have said in an earlier session, I do not expend an identical amount of time in doing so.That is, if two hours of your time were necessary for me to give you certain material it does not take me the same amount of time to refer back to the whole body of the same material.</td><td>当我回顾自己或回顾我在以前的课程上所说的话时，我不会花费相同的时间来这 样做。就是说，如果我给你们提供的资料需要花掉你扪两个小时的时间，那么我 不需花同样长的时间来回想同一资料的全部内容。</td></tr><tr><td>I did not intend to make you work so hard this evening, Joseph.If your hand is working as quickly as Ruburt's mouth then you must be exhausted.Would you like to take a break or would you prefer to end the session?I am always thinking of your convenience, at least when I am not concerned with your education.</td><td>约瑟，我没打算让你今晚这么辛苦。如果你手动得像鲁伯的嘴一样快，那么你一 定累坏了。你想休息一下，还是想结束课程？我总是为你的方便着想，至少在我 不挂心你的教育问题的时候。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:37.I was concerned lest Jane's voice give out.I urged her to call it a night although we were both eager to continue.We decided to take a short break and then resume briefly.Jane resumed pacing and dictating at 10:40.)</td><td>(10:37 休息。我担心珍的声音会哑掉。虽然我们都想继续，但我还是劝她今晚就这样吧。我们决定先休息一会儿，然后继续。珍在 10:40 重新开始来回踱步传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>While I am not affected by time on your plane I am affected by something resembling time on my plane.Time has no meaning without barriers.To put it another way, time has no meaning without the necessity to counteract against other actions.</td><td>虽然我在你们的层面上没有受到时间的影响，但我在我的层面上却受到类似时间 的影响。没有障碍，时间就没有意义。换一种说法，如果没有抵制其他行动的需 要，时间就没有意义。</td></tr><tr><td>Basically this is a gem of a description, if I do say so myself.The sad part is that you probably won't be able to understand it.It all takes time!As I try to counteract your ignorance I couldn't resist.I mean it kindly, you have no idea of the difficulties involved in explaining time to someone who must take time to try and understand the explanation.</td><td>基本上，这番描述是精华，至少我自认为如此。可悲的是，你很可能无法理解 它。这一切都需要时间！当我面对你的无知时，我又忍不住了。我是好意，你不 知道对着一个，必须花时间去尝试和理解，我对时间的解释的人，解释时间，这 其中所涉及的困难有多大。</td></tr><tr><td>The study of time will teach you much about fifth dimension also.Our imaginary wires composed of solidified vitality are fluid, I hope you understand this, even while they are solidified.For solidity is only illusion.</td><td>对时间的研究也会让你对第五维度有很多了解。由固化的生命力所组成的假想 线，即使他们被固化也是流动的，我希望你明白这一点。固化只是错觉。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane pounded on the desk for emphasis and began, surprisingly, to speak in a stronger voice.I had thought without becoming consciously involved that her voice had been strengthening and deepening since last break.Now, the deeper tone became unmistakable.As she talked it became even more pronounced, more formal and louder.</td><td>(此处珍敲了敲桌子以示强调，并开始以更大的声音说话，令人惊讶。我一直下 意识地有个想法，自上次休息后，她的声音一直在增强和变低。现在，这低沉的 语调变得明确无误了。当她说话时，声音变得更加明显，更加正式和响亮。</td></tr><tr><td>(As I looked down to write I now had the feeling that I was listening to someone else's voice.If Jane was surprised or upset by this phenomena she gave no sign that I could see.Her manner with this more formal and strong voice was almost that of a lecturer.I said nothing to her about the voice change as she talked on.)</td><td>(当我低头写字时，我感觉像在听别人的声音。如果珍对这个现象有任何惊讶或 不安，那她丝毫没让我看出来。她这种更正式和有力的说话方式，几乎就是一个 演讲者。当她继续讲下去时, 我对她声音的变化只字未提。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have said also that this feeling of vitality, and I prefer the term vitality, is moving and itself a part of the living stuff of the universe.Now as these wires pass seemingly from plane to plane they actually form the boundaries of each plane and become subject to the particular laws of the plane.Therefore they become subject to time on your plane.And they become subject to other laws, if not laws of time, on other planes.</td><td>我也说过生机活力的感觉，我比较喜欢生机活力这词，这活力是跃动的，它本身 就是宇宙活物的一部分。现在，这些假想线似乎是从一个层面穿越到另一个层 面，它们实际上形成了每一个层面的边界，并且变得受制于该层面的特定规则。所以，在你们层面，它们变得受制于时间。它们在其他层面，如果不是受制于时 间法则，那也是受制于其他法则</td></tr><tr><td>(Pause.Looking at Jane and knowing her natural feminine voice so well, I had to think twice to realize that this other new voice was issuing from her in such volume, and with no strain at all.I don't know whether I was more surprised at the fact that Jane appeared not at all disturbed by it, or by the fact that it had a definite deep and masculine tone. )</td><td>(停顿一下。看着珍，太熟知她原本的女性声音，我不得不想了再想，意识到这 另一个新的声音是以如此大的音量从她身上发出的，而且一点也不费力。事实 上，我不知道，我是惊讶于珍显得完全不受其干扰，还是惊讶于确实有一个深沉 和男性化的音调这一事实。</td></tr><tr><td>The motion of the apparently solidified vitality gives the illusion of time.The counteraction involved in this case is counteraction within the core of vitality itself, in much the same manner that we spoke of a closed mental enclosure, multiplying and setting up motion within itself.</td><td>表面上固化的生命力的运动给人以时间的错觉。在这种情况下，所涉及的反作用 是生命力核心本身的反作用，就像我们谈到的封闭的精神围场一样，在自身内部 繁殖和建立运动。</td></tr><tr><td>The action and counteraction is the time trigger.To you this will be almost unbelievable, but on some other planes motion is simultaneous and time unknown.To me time can be manipulated, used at leisure and examined.To me your time is a vehicle, one of the several vehicles by which I can enter your awareness.It is therefore still a reality of some kind to me.Otherwise I could not utilize it in any manner whatsoever.As an example of my good intentions I will end this session.</td><td>行动和反作用是时间的触发。对你们来说，这几乎是不可思议的，但在其他一些 层面上，运动是同步的，时间是未知的。对我来说，时间可以被操纵，可以随意 使用和检查。对我来说，你们的时间是一个载体，是我可以进入你们意识的几个 载体之一。因此，时间对我来说，仍然是某种实相。否则，我将无法以任何方式 利用它。为了表示我的好意，我将结束本节课。</td></tr><tr><td>I felt extremely pleased with your frames of mind this evening.I would continue if I did not have your physical limitations to contend with.For some reason I am able to come through very well, and when this happens I like to take advantage of the opportunity.After all, do you blame me?I admit that I miss you occasionally between sessions, dear friends; and Ruburt, your voice almost reminds me now of your old one.</td><td>我对你们今晚的心智架构感到非常满意。如果不是为了要应付你们身体的局限 性，我会继续下去。出于某种原因，我能够非常顺利地透过来，当这种情况发生 时，我就想好好利用这机会。总之，你会怪我吗？亲爱的朋友，我承认在不上课 的时候，我偶尔会想你们；而鲁伯，你现在的声音几乎让我想起了你以前的声音。</td></tr><tr><td>In any case I shall say good night.You should know that I too enjoy a moment of social discourse or I would not keep you so long.I regret the necessity to keep Joseph so occupied.However I try to speak to you, Joseph, and answer the questions you would ask if you had the time to open your mouth.</td><td>无论怎样，我应该道晚安了。你应该知道，我也喜欢社交谈话，否则不会占你这 么长时间。我很遗憾必须让约瑟如此忙碌。不过，我还是尽量和你说话，约瑟， 回答你会问的问题，如果你有时间开口的话。</td></tr><tr><td>(At the board, Jane and I said good night to Seth.With our hands on the pointer we received an answer.)</td><td>(在显灵板上，珍和我对赛斯说晚安。随着我们的手放在指针上，我们收到了答 案。)</td></tr><tr><td>Yes, good-bye.</td><td>是的，再见。</td></tr><tr><td>(11:05 PM.Jane's voice now was perfectly normal.As we laid the board aside she said "He feels very affectionate tonightâI almost got a lump in my throat.He's real sentimental. He'd go right on if we went back to the board, he'd go on for hours if we could stand it.He doesn't want to quit. ""</td><td>(晚上 11:05 分。珍现在的声音完全正常了。当我们把显灵板放在一边时，她说"他今晚感觉很深情，我几乎哽咽了，他真的很多情善感。如果我们回到显灵板 上，他会立即回来，如果我们能经受的住，他会说上几个小时。他并不想结束"。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane also said that Seth was quite pleased with the new voice, and that she now knows what he is thinking sometimes, even though he does not relay it to or through her as part of a message.</td><td>(珍还说，赛斯对新的声音很满意，她现在知道他有时在想什么，即使他没有把 它作为信息的一部分传达给她或通过她传达。</td></tr><tr><td>(We debated whether to continue.Jane felt better now, and of course we were interested to try resuming in this fashion since it would be something new.Almost as if by signal Jane began to dictate again.We did not touch the board.)</td><td>(我们讨论了是否要继续。珍现在感觉好多了，当然我们有兴趣试着以这种方式 继续，因为这是新的尝试。仿佛这就是信号，珍又开始传述。我们没有触碰显灵 板。)</td></tr><tr><td>Besides, you owe me a session, having missed one.</td><td>再说了，你还欠我一节课呢，因为你们错过了一次。</td></tr><tr><td>In one sense meeting with you costs me little energy, it is true.On the other hand the effort to communicate explanations does involve very real effort on my part.And so you are not the only ones who grow weary in this respect.As I have said, feeling is action, and in my communications to you feeling plays a strong part.</td><td>从某种意义上说，与你们相会，我的能量消耗很少，这是事实。但另一方面，沟 通解释的这份努力，确实涉及非常真实的努力。因此，你们并不是唯一在这方面 感到疲累的人。就像我说过的，感觉就是行动，而在我与你们的交流中，感觉起 到了强而有力的作用。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here again, Jane's voice began to deepen.)</td><td>(此时，简的声音再次开始变得深沉。)</td></tr><tr><td>I realize that you both are tired.I enjoy speaking with you and wanted merely a few moments of what you might be pleased to call normal conversation.Friends do not always talk of high and weighty matters, and at times when we have the energy left over from our philosophical dissertations, then let us now and then indulge in at least some pleasantries.</td><td>我知道你们俩都累了。我喜欢和你们交谈，只想有片刻的时间进行你们可能乐意 称之为正常的交谈。朋友之间也不会总是谈论高深的话题，在结束哲学论述后还 有剩余的精力时，让我们偶尔也沉浸在一些寒暄中吧。</td></tr><tr><td>Feeling acts in many worlds.It is the connective and it strongly connects the three of us.If I sound ponderous it is only because these necessary explanations cannot be given to you in a playful manner.You would discount them.And my dear Joseph, at times I peek in on you between sessions.The twist is a beautifully innocent and wicked contortion that I would enjoy.</td><td>感觉在许多世界中起作用。它是连接物，它强烈地连接着我们三个。如果我的话 听起来很沉重，那只是因为这些必要的解释不能以一种好玩的方式传递给你们。你们会不当一回事。我亲爱的约瑟，有时我会在课后之余偷看你。这个怪癖是我 乐在其中的美丽天真和顽皮的柔身术。</td></tr><tr><td>I see you both now very clearly and I must say that I approve of what I see.I will try to answer a few questions but let us keep these few moments in a light and pleasant vein.This is something of an experience involving your so- called emotions in these sessions for perhaps the first time.</td><td>我现在非常清楚地看到了你们俩，我必须说，我对所看到的非常满意。我会尽量 回答一些问题，但让我们保持片刻轻松愉快的气氛。这可能是你第一次在这些课 程中涉及到你所谓的情绪的体验。</td></tr><tr><td>Previously we have been too concerned with other matters for any interchange of an emotional kind, and if Ruburt's voice sounds rather dreary in this transitional phase I myself am in a very playful, I might say frisky, mood.By all means ask any questions and we will see what we can do.</td><td>之前我们太关注其他事情，少了情感方面的交流，如果说在这个过渡阶段鲁伯的 声音听起来相当沉闷的话，我自己可是处在一种非常好玩，可以说是活泼的，情 绪。好了，尽情地问吧，看我们能做些什么。</td></tr><tr><td>(At this point I laughed.</td><td>(我在这里，笑了。</td></tr><tr><td>("I'm afraid, Seth, that all the questions we've got written down here are rather serious.You caught us by surprise.")</td><td>("很抱歉，赛斯，我们写在这里的所有问题都是相当严肃的。你让我们措手不 及"。)</td></tr><tr><td>The trouble is, you see, you look upon me as a veritable fountain of knowledge, and I would also be known as a personality in myself and as a friend.</td><td>问题是，你看，你视我为一个名副其实的知识源泉，但我也能被看作是一个有自 己个性的人，也是一位朋友。</td></tr><tr><td>("Do you have friendships on your plane, as we do here?")</td><td>("在你的层面上有友谊吗，像我们这里一样？")</td></tr><tr><td>I have friendships where I am of course.The one thing about your plane that makes it such a tempting field of endeavor for all of us here is of course that we still have ties of an emotional kind, and we attempt, though clumsily, to make contact with friends.As you yourself write letters to friends in strange countries and do not forget them, so we do not forget.</td><td>我所在之处当然有友谊。对我所在之处的所有人来说，你们的层面之所以是如此 吸引人为它尽力的领域，当然就是，我们仍然有情感方面的联系，尽管很笨拙， 我们仍然试图与朋友联系。就像你自己给一个陌生国家的朋友写信一样，你不会 忘记他们，同样，我们也不会忘记。</td></tr><tr><td>("Do you have a sense of play and relaxation on your plane?")</td><td>("在你们层面有游戏和放松的感觉吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>We have a much stronger sense of play and relaxation than you have, and much more enjoyable.We can play as a child plays, having however full conscious appreciationâthe I am principleâwhich the child lacks in his fanciful games.</td><td>我们有比你们更强烈的游戏感和放松感，而且更令人愉快。我们可以像孩子一样玩耍，然而有全然的意识的领会 – "我是(I am)"的原则 – 这是孩子在他的幻象游戏中所缺乏的。</td></tr><tr><td>("Do you also experience such emotions as anger?")</td><td>("你也经历过像愤怒这样的情绪吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>I have to admit that you've lost me completely.Because we experience play why does that mean we experience anger?In your terms we experience emotions and therefore are capable of anger.However we are so disciplined that anger seldom arises.</td><td>我得承认，你把我完全弄糊涂了。我们经验游戏，为什么这就意谓着我们也经验 愤怒？用你们的说法，我们经验过情绪，因此有能力发怒。然而，然而我们是如 此有自律，以至于愤怒很少出现。</td></tr><tr><td>It's almost impossible, I can see, to talk with you in a conversational manner for purely mechanical reasons.If I speak quickly in ordinary tones through Ruburt you simply cannot write fast enough to take the words down.Some night I will speak to you as I choose for my own enjoyment.We shall have an interchange, and for that one night the notes will get the boot.I promise to speak on fairly personal and inconsequential matters so that you do not miss my pearls of wisdom.</td><td>我看得出来，几乎不可能用对话的方式和你们交谈，这纯粹是因为机制上的原 因。如果我通过鲁伯用普通的语调说得很快，你的速度根本来不及写下来。总有 一个晚上，我将以我自己选择的方式与你交谈，以便我自己享受。我们应该交流 一次，而在那一晚就把笔记开除。我保证会讲一些相当个人化的、无关紧要的事 情，这样你就不会错过我的智慧珠玑。</td></tr><tr><td>The one thing that pleases me immensely is the way Ruburt can translate at least a few of my humorous remarks and inflections of my natural speech.It is difficult to carry to you at this point but I have hopes of doing better.Ruburt's voice is an experiment.The immediacy of our sessions would be enhanced if more of my personality could come through.I could go on quite happily, you might say blithely, for hours but I shall not.I would if I thought I could get away with it.</td><td>有一件事让我非常高兴，那就是鲁伯至少能翻译出我的一些幽默话语和自然说话 的转折。在这一点上很难带给你，但我有希望做得更好。鲁伯的声音是一个实 验。如果我的个性能更多地流露出来，我们课程的即时性就会增强。我可以很高 兴地讲下去，你可以说是快活地讲上几个小时，但我不会这么做。如果我这么做 可以没事的话，我会这么做。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not some old fogy.Now and then old Frank Watts comes through simply because he is the latest independent materialization, and is used to taking things upon himself.I have not assimilated him completely but you can believe me, I intend to.</td><td>我不是什么老顽固。那个老弗兰克·沃茨，不时地透过来，只是因为他是最新款独 立的具体化，并习惯于把事情揽在自己身上。我还没有完全同化他，但是相信 我，我有此打算。</td></tr><tr><td>I am glad Joseph that you enjoy my humor.What were you going to say?</td><td>约瑟，我很高兴你喜欢我的幽默。你想说什么？</td></tr><tr><td>("I was going to say that I got a charge out of your calling Frank Watts a fathead, at our seance the other night.")</td><td>("我本来想说，那天晚上在我们的降神会上，你说弗兰克·沃茨是个笨蛋，让我像充了电般地兴奋。)</td></tr><tr><td>"I'm afraid I haven't learned humility yet.On the other hand you knew me before I knew Frank Watts, and my vanity was astounding.You were quite vain yourself, and as a woman you certainly put your present wife to shame as far as vanity is concerned.

"</td><td>许多人无法赋予片段以这样的物质实相，因此或多或少地将它们推开，保持距 离。就像鲁伯那晚的伟大经历一样，人格分离的部分穿上了另一个身份，并与鲁 伯自己的身份争夺主导权。</td></tr><tr><td>Many so-called cases of possession can be laid to this alone.The dominant personality can be likened on your plane to the dominant entity.Please understand that I am using an analogy here.As the personality on your plane actually changes, expands and grows according to its potentialities, as it presents at various times varied images to the world, such asâif you'll excuse me for using clichÃ©sâa smiling face, a sorrowful face, but is still basically the same personality, so on another level does the entity present at various times a varied appearance and speak in a different voice.As the smiling and the sorrowful face also express and expand the personality, so too do the various reincarnated personalities express and expand the entity as a whole.</td><td>许多所谓的附体案例都可以归结为这一点。在你们层面，主导人格可以被比喻为 主导存有。请你理解，我在这里用的是一个比喻。你们层面的人格实际上是根据 其潜能而变化，扩展和成长，就像它在不同时间向世界呈现不同的形象，比如， 原谅我用陈腔滥调，一张笑脸、一张苦脸，但基本上仍然是同一个人格，所以在 另一个层面，存有的确在不同时候呈现不同的外观，用不同的声音说话。正如笑 脸和苦脸也表达并扩展了人格，各种转世的人格也表达和扩展了存有的整体。</td></tr><tr><td>Without the stages of childhood, adulthood and old age, the personality could not expand to its fullest degree, and without various incarnations the entity cannot expand.Along these lines your brother Dick will most likely have an extra visit to make up on this earth for a previous early death.</td><td>没有经过童年、成年和老年的阶段，人格就不可能扩展到最充分的程度，没有形 形色色的各种转世，存有也无法扩展。遵循这些原则，你弟弟迪克极有可能会再 来地球造访，以弥补他在前世的早逝。</td></tr><tr><td>In dreaming, such a dissociated state as Ruburt reached is of course the rule, only here the ability is used to form the dream images.But these dream images work for the entity as a whole and serve as a means for the various personalities to communicate.That is, in many cases for the previous incarnated personalities to correspond with the present personality.It is a means of acquainting the present personality with its past and also of reminding it of its goals, without disturbing that blatant awake ego.</td><td>做梦时，鲁伯达到的这种解离状态，当然是常态，只是这里的能力是用来形成梦 中的影像。这些梦影象对存有整体起作用，并作为各种人格沟通的手段。也就是，在许多情况下，是给前世人格与当前人格沟通之用。这是一种让现在的人格 了解其过去的手段，也是一种提醒其目标的手段，且不至搅扰清醒时的自我。</td></tr><tr><td>Joseph when your hands grow tired I do wish you would volunteer to take a break, and relieve me of an ever-growing compassionate concern for your physical condition.Surely after our pleasant chat the other evening you should know nothing of this sort would offend me, and I would much prefer more broken-up sessions, if they are necessary, than sessions in which I see myself as a torture master.</td><td>约瑟，当你的手累了的时候，我希望你会主动休息一下，以缓解我对你身体状况 不断增长的怜悯之心。毫无疑问，你应该知道经过我们那晚的愉快交谈，这种事 是不会冒犯我的，如果有必要，我宁可课程多打断几次，也别让我看自己像个酷 刑大师。</td></tr><tr><td>And please do not think of yourself as some sort of male stenographer.Through means I cannot explain at this date I could not speak through Ruburt without you, and a kink in your own present personality would quite prevent me from communicating with you alone, if indeed Ruburt would allow it. And if you are not good I will have another cozy little chat that lasts until three o'clock in the morning.</td><td>请别认为自己是个男性速记员。目前我无法解释，若没有你，我无法通过鲁伯传 话，而且就算鲁伯允许，而你现在性格中的一个缺陷，会让我无法单独与你交流，如果你感到不太好，我将另有一个温馨小叙，可以一直聊到淩晨三点。</td></tr><tr><td>(Quite often during these sessions, Seth will call for a break just as it seems I could not write any longer without rest.My hand is actually painful by then, yet I don't believe I have ever mentioned this fact aloud. "</td><td>(在这些课程中，赛斯常常要求休息，就像我似乎不休息就不能再写下去一样。那时我的手真的很痛，但我不认为我曾经声张过。</td></tr><tr><td>("Okay then we'll take a break. ")"</td><td>("好吧。那我们就休息一下"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent.</td><td>好极了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:50.When Jane began dictating again, her voice once more deepened slightly.Resume at 10:02.)</td><td>(9:50 休息。当珍又开始传述时，她的声音再次变得低沉些。10:02 继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>As a special favor I would like to make a request.  Would you for a moment turn off your main light and open your blinds and curtains or whatever so that I may look out into the snowy night?</td><td>我想要求一个特别的恩惠，你能暂时关掉你的大灯，打开百叶窗和窗帘或其他什 么东西，让我能看到外面的雪夜？</td></tr><tr><td>While I am with you I am in a way that I will explain later attached to Jane, in that I see what she sees, and so forth.I can of course dissociate myself but the effort involved in doing this and returning is really not quite worth the effort.It is like putting one sort of diving equipment on, removing it for another, and then redoing the first.Costumes are not always physical attire. They may also serve as a sort of vehicle, in the manner of the diving equipment.</td><td>当我和你们在一起时，我以一种我稍后将解释的方式与珍相连，因为我看到了她 所看到的东西，以及其他种种。我当然能解离自己，但这样做和返回所涉及的努 力却不太值得。就像穿上某种潜水装备，脱下它换上另一种，然后又重新穿上之 前那套。装束并不总是身体的衣着，它们也可以作为一种载具，就像潜水装备那 样。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane now turned off the brightest of our two lights, then opened the blinds as Seth requested. She stood at the window, looking out at our busy intersection one house away as she talked.Fresh snow covered everything.)</td><td>(珍现在关掉了我们两盏灯中最亮的一盏，然后照赛斯要求的，打开了百叶窗， 她一边说话一边站在窗前，看向我们一房之隔的、繁忙的十字路口。新雪覆盖了 一切。)</td></tr><tr><td>"The view is truly astounding.I'm glad you live on such a nice corner; and as far as Einstein is concerned, he saw more than he knew he saw, and he was more than he knew he was.We will go into this thoroughly when we return to our discussion of time."</td><td>这景色真是令人赞叹。我很高兴你们住在这么好的角落里；就爱因斯坦而言，他 见到的比他以为他看见的还要多，他也比他自认的自己还要多。当我们回到对时 间的讨论时，我们将好好地讨论这个话题。</td></tr><tr><td>(I had mentioned asking Seth about Einsteins theories during last break, and we had also mentioned our cat, Willy.)</td><td>(我曾提到，在上次休息时，问过赛斯关于爱因斯坦的理论，我们也提到了我们 的猫，威利。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your cat is indeed a fragment, and he does sense me at times.</td><td>你们的猫确实是一个片段，而且牠有时确实能感觉到我。</td></tr><tr><td>("How about that time in the kitchen?"</td><td>("那次在厨房是怎么回事？"</td></tr><tr><td>(On a recent Friday night, we had just returned home from grocery shopping.Jane had opened some fresh food for Willy and while he ate in our very small kitchen she began putting the groceries away.Carrying an empty waste basket, I walked out to the kitchen from my studio.Jane was kneeling, reaching into a cupboard, and Willy was momentarily trapped behind her.At my approach he began to hiss and spit quite madly and raced about in a tight little circle, not being able to get out of the kitchen.Jane, her back to him, stood up so quickly that she banged her head on an open cupboard door.The blow was a hard one and left her somewhat dazed for hours.We had never seen Willy behave this way before, and in a few moments he was as friendly and calm as usual, and resumed eating.</td><td>(最近的一个星期五晚上，我们刚从杂货店买东西回家。珍给威利开了些新鲜的 食物，威利在我们小小的厨房吃东西时，她开始把杂货放好。我提着一个空的垃 圾筐，从我的工作室走到厨房。珍正跪在地上，把手伸进橱柜里，威利被困在她 身后。当我走近时，牠开始发狂地嘶嘶叫着、口吐唾液，转着小圆圈跑，没办法 离开厨房。珍背对着牠快速地站起，头撞在打开的柜门上。撞得很重，她头晕了 几个小时。我们以前从来没有见过威利这样的行动，过了一会儿，他又像往常一 样友好和平静，又开始进食。</td></tr><tr><td>(A second similar episode took place a few days later.This time I walked into the living room.It was dark outside. Jane was holding Willy.At my approach he spat in a terrified manner and vaulted from her arms, scratching her quite well on both forearms.Again, a minute later he was as friendly as ever to both of us.)</td><td>(几天后又发生了第二起类似事件。这一次我走进客厅。外面很黑，珍抱着威 利。当我接近时，牠惊恐地吐着唾沫，从她的胳膊上拱起身来，在她的两个胳膊 上狠狠地抓了一把。一分钟后，牠又像以前一样对我们两个人很友好。)</td></tr><tr><td>His senses are extremely acute, his inner senses perfectly attuned.Even now he senses my presence.However as he grows more familiar with me his strange actions will altogether cease.My presence alternates between you both and this leads to confusion on Willy's part.Watch him even now.</td><td>牠的感官极为敏锐，牠的内在感官完美地调准了。即使现在牠也能感觉到我的存 在。然而，随着他对我越来越熟悉后，牠的怪异行动会完全停止。我的存在，在 你们俩之间交替出现，这让威利困惑。你看看牠，现在看。</td></tr><tr><td>(Even as Seth spoke through Jane, Willy uttered a loud meow.He began to tease and jump at her, as he will do when he wants attention.Now however he was unusually persistent.Entangling himself in Jane's feet as she tried to pace back and forth, he finally interrupted her dictation while she petted him.He then hopped up on Jane's empty chair, opposite mine, and lay there staring at me for some time while I took notes.His eyes were very large and luminous and somehow darker than usual.I then realized that Jane's eyes also had this look when she was dictating.It was some time before Willy finally relaxed and slept on the chair. "</td><td>(就在赛斯透过珍说话时，威利发出一声响亮的喵叫声。牠开始向她挑逗和跳 跃，就像牠想要得到关注时那样。然而现在牠却异常地固执。当珍来回踱步时， 牠把自己缠在她的脚上，而她抚摸着牠时，终于打断了传述。然后牠跳上我对面 珍的空椅子上，盯着我看了一会儿，我在做笔记。牠的眼睛又大又亮，不知何故 比平时更黑了。然后我意识到，当珍在传述时，她的眼睛看起来也是这样。过了 一段时间，威利终于放松下来，在椅子上睡着了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth now referred to a fragment of a vision I had experienced the day before.I had been doing some painting when once again I seemed to see my brother Loren, as a monk in a previous life, wearing his old red robe, fall face down with outstretched arms upon the same dusty red road upon which I had seen him before.This was a very brief vision, and the first that had popped to mind consciously while I was doing something else.)</td><td>(赛斯现在提到了我前一天经历的那闪现的画面是一个片段。当时我正在画画， 我好像再次看到我的弟弟洛伦，前世身为一位僧人，穿着他的旧红袍，伸开双臂，脸朝下趴在我以前见过他的那条尘土飞扬的红路上。这是一段非常短的景象，也是我在做其他事情时第一次有意识地跳进脑海。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your vision experience is coming along well, Joseph.You can expect it to enlarge, grow and mature, as Ruburt's ability has already shown astounding progress.I hesitate to go into Jane's Walter Zeh experience at this time.Her conscious ego sets up barriers, and in all cases she must willingly permit material to come through.Suffice it to say that she got rid of some previous responsibilities and paid off an old debt.</td><td>你的灵视(vision)经历进展得很好，约瑟。你可以期待它扩展、成长和成熟，就像鲁伯的能力已经显示出惊人的进步。我很犹豫要不要这时进入珍的沃尔特·泽*经 历中。她有意识的自我设立了阻碍，任何情况下，她都必须是心甘情愿地允许资 料通过来。我只想说，她摆脱了以前的一些责任，还清了一笔旧债。</td></tr><tr><td>I have been visiting other planes lately.I grow quite gymnastic.</td><td>我最近经常出入其他层面。练就得身手相当矫健。</td></tr><tr><td>("Seth, will you tell us something about President Kennedy?")</td><td>("赛斯，你能告诉我们一些关于肯尼迪总统的事吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>He was your president, not mine.You know who the assassin was.Of course the senseless slaughter was not foreordained.It was always a realm of the possible world, and the tragic circumstances culminated in much the same manner as Jane related in her idea Construction.</td><td>他是你们的总统，不是我的。你们都知道谁是刺客了。当然，这场毫无意义的屠 杀并不是注定的。它始终是一个可能的世界的领域，悲剧的情节最终以与珍的《理念建构》中描述的相同方式达到高潮。</td></tr><tr><td>Jack Kennedy himself had a premonition of events and even in the midst of action he was prepared for death.His subconscious mind always knew the true nature of death and flirted with it consciously.</td><td>杰克*·肯尼迪本人对事件有预感，甚至在事件的过程中，他也做好了死亡的准 备。他的潜意识心智一直都知道死亡的真正本质，并有意识地轻率对待。(译注:杰克是约翰的一个常见昵称，这是他成长过程中家人对他的称呼。)</td></tr><tr><td>"When I said watch the cat I didn't realize he was going to put on this display.I assure you I didn't order it. "</td><td>当我说看那只猫时，我并没意识到牠要玩这一套。我向你保证，我没指使牠。</td></tr><tr><td>(Willy was acting up again, chasing after Jane as she paced back and forth while dictating.)</td><td>(威利又开始调皮捣蛋了，珍在来回踱步传述时，一直追着她。)</td></tr><tr><td>The good Jack will be a beggar boy in India, to be born in 3 years.In later life he will attain prominence if he carries through as beautifully as he did in the past.His first name will be Ambum, A-m-b-u-m, pronounced Ammum.This time he will attain prominence from poverty, an experience which will greatly reinforce the strength of his entity's purpose.</td><td>这好小子杰克将在 3 年内出生为印度的乞儿。如果他像之前的生命那般做得一样漂亮，将成就显赫。他的名字将是 Ambum，A - M - B - U - M，发音安姆[Ammum]。这一次他将从贫困中脱拔出来，这一经历将大大加强他的存有目标的力量。</td></tr><tr><td>Oswald was always a personality fragment, as all psychopaths are.As fragments of a personality break off in the manner that I explained for schizophrenics, so in some cases part of an entity reincarnates before it should, does not carry its full mental gene blueprint, and therefore causes trouble and confusion.It is as though one of the wild images of a nightmare emerged with full physical power into the world of the day.</td><td>像所有的精神病患一样，奥斯瓦德[Oswald]一直是一个人格片段。像我解释精神分裂患者的那样，人格的片段会从主要行为人格断裂，所以在某些情况下，存有的一部分在它应该转世之前就转世了，没有携带完整的精神基因蓝图，因此会造成麻烦和混乱。就好像噩梦中某个狂野影象，带着完整的物质能量出现在白天的世 界一样。</td></tr><tr><td>Such people realize their deficiency, yet conversely because they do have a distorted but seemingly dominant "I" they are only all the more furious and confused.There is no basic unifying factor to give them consistency, and no unifying subconscious memories to give them true inner identity.This is one of the main reasons why they strike out at strongly integrated personalities, and why it is so easy for them to be catapulted by raw emotion into tragedies of this sort.</td><td>这样的人明白自己的不足，然而反过来，因为他们的确有一个扭曲的但看似占主 导地位的"我"，他们只会更加猖狂和困惑。没有基本的整合因素使他们稳定， 也没有整合的潜意识记忆为他们提供真实的内在身份。这是他们在强烈的综合人 格中出击的主要原因之一，也是他们为什么很容易被原始情感弹射到这种悲剧中 的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>Nightmares represent onlyies of disintegrations that rarely occur in actuality.I bring this up since I did mention the word in passing.They are usually not messages as most dreams are from past personalities to the present personality, though they may be messages from the primary personality to itself, as notice of fear or panic that may exist directly beneath the strata of the primary personality.Beneath this you will find the succeeding layers that have to do with personal reincarnations.Beneath this you will find material dealing with the race as a whole, and as Jane supposed even layers dealing with the prehumen state.</td><td>噩梦只代表鲜少在现实中发生的崩解的可能性。我提起这事，是因为我顺便提到 了这个词。它们通常不是像大多数梦境那样，是来自过去人格对当前人格的信 息，虽然它们可能是主要人格给它自己的信息，通知它直接存在于主要人格阶层 下的恐惧或恐慌。在此之下，你会发现与个人转世有关的后续层次。再往下，你 会发现涉及整体种族的资料，就像珍设想的那样，甚至有几层是关于人类存在之 前的状态。</td></tr><tr><td>The entity is the sum of these layers, having all of this knowledge at conscious command at all times.Yet though I speak of them as one beneath the other they are not actually so, and I speak only for convenience.They are in all places, intertwined with paths leading from one to the other and with the echo of the entity's voice resounding through each interconnecting corridor.</td><td>存有是这些层的总和，在任何时候都能有意识地指挥所有这些知识。然而，尽管 我把它们说成是一个在另一个之下，但实际上并非如此，我这样说只是为了方 便。它们在所有的地方，交织在一起，有路径从一个通向另一个，存有的声音的 回声，响彻每个相互连接的走廊。</td></tr><tr><td>I have decided as you have seen to include a little new material this evening.However, I shall not neglect at any time to give you a thorough picture of any material that I have once discussed.</td><td>正如你们所看到的，今晚我决定加一点新的资料。然而，我在任何时候，都不会 忽视对我曾经讨论过的任何资料的彻底描述。</td></tr><tr><td>("Can we take a break now?")</td><td>("我们能不能休息一下？") 如果你想的话，可以休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take a break if you so desire.</td><td>(10:37 休息。上述传述中，珍的声音非常正常，之后的课一直维持这样。我没有问任何问题，10:45 恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:37. During the above monologue Jane's voice was quite normal, and so it remained for the rest of the session.Without my asking any questions, Jane resumed dictating at 10:45)</td><td>在某程度上，你们自己多多少少觉知到其他层面，也多少能和这些层面沟通，就 像你们与你们的猫沟通一样。想象力让你们能够进入这些层面，就像你们想像另 一种动物的生活一样。</td></tr><tr><td>You are yourselves aware of other planes to some degree, and to some degree you can communicate with them as you communicate with your cat.Imagination allows you to enter into these planes, as when you imagine what another animal's life would be.</td><td>的确，在生理上人是动物，就像猫是动物一样。尽管如此，各种存在的种种差异 相当于层面级别的差异，但又不至于大相迥异，所以形形色色的存在确实能够共 存。你当然不能体验猫对时间的感知，但你对牠们时间感的理解，远比牠们能对你们的时间感的理解来得接近。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true that man is physically an animal and that a cat is an animal. Nevertheless the differences amount to a difference in plane, though they are not actually different enough, and so the various existences do manage to coexist.You cannot of course experience the cat's sense of time, but you can come closer to understanding his sense of time than he could ever come in understanding yours.</td><td>(休息时我提到了赛斯宣称造访了其他层面。)</td></tr><tr><td>(During break I had mentioned Seth's declared visits to other planes.)</td><td>在一个广义的层面内，生命当然明显地变化不一，并且发生着许多各种各样的演 化。当我说，我访问过另一个层面，你可以想象以下的经历。</td></tr><tr><td>There are of course therefore obvious variations in life within one generalized plane, and many various sorts of evolution occurring.When I say I visit another plane you can imagine the following experience Pretend that you not only understood your cat's concept of time to some degree, but could also experience his sense of time through the cat itself.In doing this you would in no way bother, inhibit or annoy the cat. He would not be aware of your presence and in no way could this be represented as any sort of an invasion.</td><td>假设你不仅在某种程度上理解你的猫的时间概念，而且还能通过猫本身体验他的 时间感。在这样做的时候，你不会以任何方式打扰、抑制或惹恼猫。他不会意识 到你的存在，而且这也不可能被视为任何形式的入侵。</td></tr><tr><td>(And here, staring at me, Jane pounded the table for emphasis.)</td><td>(在这里，珍盯着我，拍了拍桌子以示强调。)</td></tr><tr><td>Imagine further that you actually experienced the feeling of such a furry coat, and all the other feline equipment from the inside.Purely as a spectator this would loosely represent an analogy to my traveling to other planes.It follows that I could not travel to higher planes than my own, where more acute senses than mine would instantly perceive me.This sort of thing does not as a rule go on in your plane.Even with your limited senses you would perceive my presence, though my plane is further developed than yours.</td><td>进一步想象一下，你真的体验到了这样一个毛茸茸的皮毛的感觉，并且从内部体 验了所有其他猫科动物的设备。纯粹作为一个旁观者，这大体上代表了我到其他 层面的比喻。因此，我无法到达比我自己层面高的层面，在那里，比我更敏锐的 感官会立刻察觉到我。这种事情通常不会发生在你们的层面上。即使你的感官有 限，你也会觉察到我的存在，尽管我的层面比你们的层面更发达。</td></tr><tr><td>So you see that the laws operate in such a manner that we are more or less kept in our place.Controls are applied.This subject will come up again and I will go into it more deeply.You have also seen that your cat can sense me to some extent when I am in his environment, so we do not get away with much.</td><td>所以你看，规则以这样的方式在运作，那就是，我们或多或少被留在我们的地 方。是有管控的。这一主题将再次出现，我还会更深入地讨论它。你也已经看到 了，当我在牠的环境中时，你们的猫能在某种程度上感觉到我，所以我们并没有 逃脱很多。</td></tr><tr><td>On many planes we are fully visible to others on that plane.To some we are invisible, and to us some are invisible.</td><td>在许多层面上，我们是完全能够被看到的。在某些层面，我们是隐形的，而对我 们而言，有些是隐形的。</td></tr><tr><td>([I asked Jane:] "Is Seth going to say anything about his form?")</td><td>([我问珍：]"赛斯打算谈谈他的形态吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>As I have mentioned earlier the senses change according to the plane of materialization.If you are speaking about my present form, I can be many forms.That is, within limits I can change my form, but in doing so I do not actually change my form so much as I choose to become part of something else.</td><td>正如我前面提到的，感官随着物质化的层面而改变。如果你说的是我现在的形 态，我可以有很多种形态。就是说，在限度之内，我可以改变自己的状态，但在 这样做的时候，我实际上没有改变我的形态，而是选择成为其他东西的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>My incipient form is a man's form, if this is what you want to know, but it is not materialized in the same fashion as yours that is as your form and I can dematerialize it whenever I choose.</td><td>我的初始形态是一个人的形态，如果这就是你想知道的，但它不是以与你相同的 方式物化的，也就是作为你们的形式，我可以在任何时候选择将它非物化。</td></tr><tr><td>It is not however at all physical in your terms.. . And so here I suppose we will run into a block.The physical human form is extremely important to all entities, and they retain its idea shape for a long while.Again I will have more to say about the idea shape, which is somewhat like the physical genes and the blueprint, only on a different manifestation level.I believe, though I am not positive, that this human idea shape vanishes at some point and changes into another that is somehow more fitting and ideal.The entity in itself may only be a part of something else.</td><td>"然而，从你们的角度来看，它根本不是物质的所以在这里我想我们会遇到一个障碍。对所有的存有而言，物质的人类形态是极其重要的，存有长期保留着这 个概念形状[idea shape]。还有，我对概念形状还有更多的要说，那有点像是物质的基因与蓝图，不过是在不同的显化层面。虽然我并不肯定，但我相信，这个人 类的概念形状会在某个时刻消失，变成另一种更适合、更理想的形态。存有本身 可能只是其他东西的一部分。"</td></tr><tr><td>("Can you tell us something about the dream Jane had, in which she seemed to be receiving instructions on psychic phenomena?"</td><td>("你能告诉我们关于珍做的梦吗，在梦中，她似乎在接受灵性现象的指示？"</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane dictates in a normal voice:)</td><td>(珍以正常的嗓音传述:)</td></tr><tr><td>There are various types of dreams and dream fragments.I will follow this through also later, since in these beginning sessions I am giving you what may be considered a broad outline to be filled in.These dissociated states often occur in sleep, an excellent time since the ego is quieted.At such times it is extremely possible for present personalities to be visited by others such as myself, but only on the bidding of the entity itself.</td><td>有各种类型的梦与梦的片段。我以后还会详述，因为这些刚开始的课程，我只能 提供一个大致的轮廓，内容将来再补充。这些解离状态经常发生在睡眠中，那是 个绝佳时刻，因为自我已经安静了。在这种时刻，当前人格极有可能被其他人造 访，比如像我这样的人，但这仅限于在存有本身的要求下。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that we close this session for this evening.I have endeavored to fill in some previously mentioned material tonight.After our last arduous meeting you really needed a bit of relaxation.Nevertheless as you read this material you will see that it correlates with many other matters, and forms necessary connections which will be important in future discussions.</td><td>我建议结束今晚的课程。我今晚一直在努力补充前面提到的一些资料。在我们上 次艰巨的课程结束后，你真的需要一点放松。然而，当你阅读这些资料时，你会 发现它与许多其他事项相关，并形成必要的联系，这在未来的讨论中是很重要的。</td></tr><tr><td>It is not that I wasn't feeling humorous this evening, merely that I didn't think you could stand the full force of my really astounding sardonic nature.I just say these things to watch your reactions.And as far as assimilating our old friend Frank Watts, don't let me lead you too far astray.</td><td>并不是说我今晚不觉得幽默，只是我认为你招架不住我真正令人震惊的嘲讽本性 的全部力量。我说这些事情只是在观察你们的反应。至于同化我们的老朋友弗兰 克·沃茨，别让我把你引入歧途太远。</td></tr><tr><td>(I was about to ask Seth about assimilating Frank Watts.)</td><td>(我正要问赛斯关于同化弗兰克·沃茨的事。)</td></tr><tr><td>The entity never dominates or tries to dominate a previous personality.Sometimes these personalities also travel divergent ways for their own benefit and with the entity's full consent.</td><td>存有从来不支配或试图支配先前的人格。有时这些人格也会为了裨益自身，在存 有完全同意之下，走不同的路。</td></tr><tr><td>There is no such thing as division as far as the personality is concerned.Even a full-fledged fragment can turn into an entity in certain cases.There are no rules that hold any living thing down to one form or one kind of existence.And now, dear patient friends, I bid you a most fond good night.</td><td>就人格而言，不存在所谓的分裂。在某些情况下，一个成熟的片段也可以转化成 为一个存有。没有任何规则将任何生物限制在一种形式或一种存在。现在，亲爱 的、有耐心的朋友们，向你们致上最美好的晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seated at the board, we touched our hands to the pointer.I spoke first, then Jane.</td><td>(坐在显灵板旁，我们把手触向指针。我先开口，然后是珍。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good-bye, Seth.

")"</td><td>("赛斯，为什么当珍现在传递你的讯息时，她的眼睛显得更黑，更亮？我们的 猫在上一节课时，眼睛看起来也是这样"。)</td></tr><tr><td>"Concentration.(Jane dictates:) Yet ego is relaxed.The cat focuses upon one thing at a time even though it has no strong ego.So Jane concentrates while I give her the messages, even though it is not her ego which is concentrating.You get a subconscious focus different in many ways from conscious concentration.In this state the attention is focused inward rather than outward, and it is the inner senses more than the outer that are being exercised.The cat is doing the same thing in his way that Jane is, and in the particular situation you are thinking of his inner senses, that is the cat's, were focused in my direction. "</td><td>专注。(珍传述:)但自我是放松的。尽管猫没有强大的自我，但它一次只专注于 一件事。因此，当我传讯息给珍时，珍很专注，虽然专注的不是她的自我。你们潜意识的专注，在许多方面都与有意识的集中不同。在这种状态下，注意力是向内而非向外集中，行使的是内在感官而非外在感官。这只猫正在以牠的方式做着和珍一样的事，而在你所想的特定情况下，牠的内在感官，也就是猫的内在感 官，都集中在我的方向。</td></tr><tr><td>As far as light being a mental enzyme, this is true.I'm pleased that you came forward with this yourself.There are other mental enzymes of course.Whether we will go into this during tonight's session I don't know.</td><td>至于光是精神酵素，这是事实。我很高兴你自己想到这个。当然还有其他的精神 酵素。我不知道今晚是否会谈到这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>The main mental enzymes create senses on the physical plane in order that they may be recognized and appreciated by the physical being.The mental enzymes are the same basically throughout the universe, but their materializations on a particular plane are determined by the properties inherent in the plane itself.The quality called light on this plane could just as well appear as sound in another, and for that matter even on this plane light can be changed into sound and sound into light.</td><td>主要的精神酵素在物质层面上创造了感觉，以便它们可以被物质存在所识别和欣 赏。精神酵素在整个宇宙中基本上是相同的，但它们在某个特定层面上的物化， 是由该层面本身固有的属性决定的。在这个层面上被叫做光的性质，在另一个层面上也可以作为声音出现，而且即使在这个层面上，光也可以变成声音，声音也 可以变成光。</td></tr><tr><td>It is always interaction which is important.Even the mental enzymes themselves are interchangeable as far as the principle behind them is concerned, though for practical purposes they maintain separate and distinct qualities in their materializations in one plane.That is why it is possible for some human beings to experience sound as color, or to see color in sound.Granted this is not characteristic experience, but if the mental enzymes were not interchangeable in principle, then this experience would not be possible for any.Light would never be heard for example, sound would never be seen.Nor is color usually heard, nor sound usually seen.</td><td>重要的是，始终存在着交互作用。即使是精神酵素本身，就其背后的原理而言， 也是可以互换的，尽管为了实际的目的，它们在一个层面的物化中保持着独立和 不同的品质。这就是为什么有些人有可能把声音体验为颜色，或在声音中看到颜 色。就算这不是特有的经验，但如果精神酵素在原则上不能互换，那么这种经验 对任何人来说都是不可能的。例如，光永远不会被听到，声音永远不会被看到。颜色通常也听不到，声音通常也看不到。</td></tr><tr><td>In practical terms these mental enzymes must of course, and do, give a predictable, more or less dependable result.The reason why they must is understandable.The thing to remember is that this interchangeability can occur and is therefore an ability or property of the mental enzyme in general.</td><td>在实践中，这些心理酵素当然必须，而且也确实给出一个可预测的、或多或少可 靠的结果。它们必须这样做的原因是可以理解的。要记住的是，这种互换性可以 发生，因此是一般精神酵素的能力或属性。</td></tr><tr><td>On your plane the action of the mental enzyme would appear to be more or less inflexible, more or less static, irreversible, and permanent.This of course is not the case.It is a view caused by the difficulty of getting any perspective about the particular plane which you happen to inhabit.</td><td>在你们的层面上，精神酵素的作用似乎或多或少是不灵活的，或多或少是静态 的，不可逆的，和永久的。当然，情况并非如此。这是对你碰巧居住的特定层面 难以获得任何观点而造成的观点。</td></tr><tr><td>(By now Jane's voice had begun to grow somewhat deeper and louder. )"</td><td>(现在珍的声音开始变得有些深沉和宏亮。)</td></tr><tr><td>Because mental enzymes seem to give the same effects most of the time in your physical universe, your scientists for years blithely labeled these as the laws of nature, that is, the apparent laws of cause and effect.Now because, if you'll excuse the pun, a certain cause will usually give a certain effect in your physical universe, you may be justified in saying that these apparent results are laws that operate within your physical universe.But please, stay in your own backyard.</td><td>在你们物质宇宙，精神酵素似乎大多数时候都产生相同的效果，所以你们的科学 家多年来，一直轻率地将这些标记为自然规律，也就是，明显的因果律。现在， 如果你能原谅我的双关语，在你们的物质宇宙中，某种原因通常会产生某种效 果，你可能有理由说，这些明显的结果，是在你们的物质宇宙中运行的规律。但 是，拜托了，别把这规则套用到你们的物质宇宙之外，留在你们宇宙自家的后院 就好了。</td></tr><tr><td>What I am trying to say is that there are apparent rules of cause and effect, but the same causes do not always give the same effects.There is much more that I want to say along these lines.If you will perhaps consider again our wires and mazes, I have said if you'll excuse the brief reminder, that these imaginary wires are composed of solidified vitality.They are the living stuff of the universe even as they form its boundaries and seem to divide it into labyrinthine ways, like the inside of a honeycomb.</td><td>我想说的是，的确有明显的因果规律，但相同的原因并不总是给出相同的结果。沿着这些思路，我想说的还有很多。如果你愿意再想一想我们的电线和迷宫，我 说过，如果你不介意我这简短的提示，这些想象的电线是由固化的生命力所组 成。即使它们就像蜂窝的内部一样形成了边界，也似乎把宇宙分隔成了迷宫，但 它们是宇宙中有生命的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>The planes within the tiny wires, that is the planes formed by the connections and interconnections of our imaginary wires, come into the sphere of each different plane and take on the form inherent in the plane itself.Therefore these wires, if we may use a small analogy, will grow thick or thin, or change color completely, like some chameleon-like animal constantly camouflaging its true appearance by taking on the outward manifestations of each neighboring forest territory.Then too, the inhabitants of any particular plane are chameleon like, animal like.Solidified vitality wires do not look like boundaries or divisions.They appear exactly of the same type as the other materializations on that particular plane.</td><td>在这细微线段内的层面，也就是说，这些层面是由我们假想线的连接，和交互连 接形成的层面，进到了每个不同层面的界域内，并采用了那个层面本有的形式。因此，这些线，打个小比方，就好像变色龙那类的动物，不断地通过采取每个相 邻森林领土的外在表象，来伪装自己的真实面貌。变得或厚、或薄，或彻底改变 颜色。那么，任何特定层面的居民也都像变色龙一样，像动物一样。这些固化的 生命线，看起来并不像边界或分界线。它们看起来完全就像那特定层面上其他物 质化的类型。</td></tr><tr><td>The inhabitants see only the camouflage.They then accept this particular camouflage as a definite rule of nature, never realizing that just beyond their eyesight and just beyond all their outer senses, this familiar tamed animal of a law changes appearance completely.So complete in fact is the transformation as to be almost in some cases unrecognizable.</td><td>居民们只看到伪装。然后他们接受这种特殊的伪装作为自然界的明确规则，从未 意识到，就在他们的视线之外，就在他们所有的外在感官之外，这个熟悉、驯服 的动物—自然规则，就彻底地改变了外观。事实上，这种转变是如此彻底，以至 于在某些情况下几乎无法辨认。</td></tr><tr><td>However, by seeing beneath the camouflage in any one case you see beneath the camouflage in all cases.What these wires are, therefore, that seem to divide our planes and that appear so differently in one plane than they do in another, are solidified vitality whose camouflaging action is determined by mental enzymes.</td><td>然而，借由看见伪装底下的任何一个情况，你能看见伪装底下所有的情况。因 此，这些线是什么，它们似乎把我们的层面分割开来，在一个层面和另一个层面 的表现如此不同，它们是凝固的生命力，其伪装作用由精神酵素决定。</td></tr><tr><td>Now you will understand why I said earlier that sound can be seen and color can be heard.There are many diverse examples along this line.If you will forgive me Joseph, at the risk, and I do mean the risk, of becoming boring, I would like to repeat briefly: Mental enzymes allow the solidified vitality to change its form.If I said this in the beginning before this discussion, it would have choked you to swallow it.</td><td>现在你会明白，为什么我之前说，声音可以被看到，颜色可以被听到。沿着这个 思路，还有许多不同的例子。如果你能原谅我，约瑟，冒着变得无聊的风险，我 确实是指风险，我想简单重复一下：精神酵素允许固化的生命力改变其形式。如 果我在讨论前，一开始就说这句话，你会噎着，吞不下去。</td></tr><tr><td>Your light is a mental enzyme tipped me off that you were ready for this discussion.Needless to say solidified vitality and mental enzymes are dependent upon each other in many ways.The enzyme part of our little equation therefore permits vitality to operate successfully under diverse mental and physical situations, and to form the basis for each particular plane.(Pause. )</td><td>你说光是一种精神酵素，这个说法，向我透露了，你已经准备好了这次讨论。无 须多说，固化的生命力和精神酵素在许多方面互相依赖。因此，在我们小方程式 的酵素这部分，允许生命力根据不同的精神和物质情况成功地进行运作，形成每 个特定层面的基础。(停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take a break.I am very pleased with your progress this evening so far.</td><td>我建议休息一下。到目前为止，我对你今晚的进展非常满意。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:45.Jane and I both were surprised at the amount of material we had gathered in forty-five minutes.The time seemed to fly.During this session our cat Willy slept the whole time.Jane's voice never went beyond a certain medium deepening and a small increase in volume.At times as she talked it was quite normal.During this break I mentioned that I would like to ask Seth about flying saucers.Jane resumed dictating at 9:51. )"</td><td>(9:45。珍和我都对我们在这 45 分钟的时间内收集到的资料数量感到惊讶。时间像飞的一般。我们的猫威利，整节课都在睡觉。珍的声音一直维持中度的低沉， 音量稍微变大。有时她说话时声音很正常。我在休息中说，我想问一下赛斯关于 飞碟的事情。珍 9:51 继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Incidentally I do have access to your conscious and unconscious minds, but only when you permit it.Consciously neither of you are aware of the subtle permission or refusal of permission that you yourselves give.And as far as suggestion is concerned, since you both have been reading along these lines, there is a point where the most suggestible of persons is beyond reach.</td><td>顺便说一句，我的确能读取你们的意识和无意识心智，但只有在你们允许的情况 下。在意识上，你们都没有意识到你们自己给予的微妙许可或拒绝许可。而就暗 示而言，因为你俩都一直在沿着这类的路线在解读，会有那么一个点，在那儿， 即使最容易接受暗示的人也无法被暗示。</td></tr><tr><td>It is unfortunately true that the dominant present ego can be degraded on your plane to an amazing degree, through for example brainwashing and so forth.However this situation, while bad enough, is not as dire as you might think.When you are considering the human personality as a thing of this time only and destroyed by death, then its disintegration for any reason seems truly a tragic thing.And it is tragic.</td><td>很不幸的事实是，占主导地位的当前自我，在你们的层面，通过洗脑之类的，可 以降级到一个惊人的程度。然而，虽然这种情况很糟糕，却也没你想象的那么悲 惨。当你们认为人类人格只是此时的一样东西，在死亡时被摧毁，那么，无论是 什么原因造成这个崩解，似乎真的是件悲惨的事。这才是悲剧。</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless, when you think in terms of the entity and its various personality manifestations throughout your earth time then you realize that the basic self, the entity, cannot be destroyed in any particular earth life.You are, I know, acquainted with the idea of regeneration.If you will imagine the various reincarnated personalitiesâand this is a most unpleasant analogyâas the various limbs and other faculties of the entity, then you will see why if one fragment is disintegrated it can be regenerated in the same manner that a physical cell of your body can be regenerated.</td><td>然而，当你以存有的角度以及存有的各式人格在地球时间的显化来思考时，你就 会觉悟到，那个基本的自己、也就是存有，不可能在任何一个特定的地球生命中 被摧毁。我知道，你熟悉再生的观念。如果你把各个转世人格—这是一个令人很 不舒服的比喻—想像成存有的各个肢体和其他器官，那么你就会明白为什么如果 一个片段被分解，它能以你身体细胞能再生的同样方式再生。</td></tr><tr><td>This is actually not as bad an analogy as I first thought, in that oftentimes a particular personality will be like the right arm of the entity as a whole, while another particular personality will have both feet on the ground.To get back however to the original point I wish to make, there is a point beyond which the most suggestible personality will be beyond reach, no matter what the circumstances are.Manifestations of the personality may follow the lines that suggestion commands.This is bad enough, but it only means that the personality has been forced to change its mode of action in the physical world.The personality seems shattered because the actions seem so changed.And here again we have your cause and effect, misapplied.The basic personality, that is the primary personality, has not been changed and will not change except through the personality itself.</td><td>其实，这比喻并不像我最先想的那么糟，经常，某个特定人格就像整体存有的一 只右臂，而另一个特定人格就像踏在地上的双脚。然而，回到我想说的原点，有 一个点，越过这个点，将触及不到那最易受暗示的人格，无论是何种情况。人格 的显化可能会遵循暗示的指示。这已够糟糕了，但这只意味着，人格被迫在物质 世界中改变其行为模式。因为行为改变得如此厉害，那人格仿佛破裂了。再次地，这里有你们误用的因果关系。基本人格，也就是主要人格，并没改变，而且，也不会改变，除非透过人格自身。</td></tr><tr><td>What may occur is that lesser fragments of the personality, that were at one time possible competing elements for the dominant personality, take over.</td><td>可能发生的情况是，那一度曾想争取成为主导人格的小片段人格，取而代之。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane pounded the table for emphasis, although her voice was normal.)</td><td>(这里珍拍着桌子以示强调，虽然她的声音是正常的。)</td></tr><tr><td>These may come to the foreground in bad circumstances, and actually save the basic personality itself from what would certainly be disintegration.It is as if the basic personality throws the dirty dogs bone after bone, all the while saving the real morsel.</td><td>在糟糕的情况下，这些片段可能走到前台，这实际上救了基本人格自身，免掉了 必然的崩裂。这就像基本人格丢给脏狗一根又一根的骨头，其实是在拯救真正的 佳肴。</td></tr><tr><td>I certainly do hesitate to go into your flying saucer question this evening.</td><td>今晚我真的很犹豫谈你的飞碟话题。</td></tr><tr><td>It is not complicated in itself, but complicated in the telling.I do want to mention one little point with which you might be concerned or pleased.You are both experiencing at this point, and have experienced in the past, the distorted time element, or so-called foreshortened time that you read about in your books on hypnotism.If you will notice the time by the clock you will see how much material I have given you in something like 15 minutes.I do like to save a few little surprises like this for you now and then.</td><td>它本身并不复杂，复杂的是怎么说。我真的想提一小点你可能会关心或高兴的 事。你俩此刻正在经历，过去也曾经历过，扭曲的时间元素，或你在有关催眠的书中读到的，所谓的按透视法缩短的时间。如果你注意一下时钟的时间，你会看到我在 15 分钟内已经为你提供了多少资料。我确实喜欢时不时地为你保留一些像这样的小惊喜。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth made this surprising statement at 10:12, just 21 minutes since we ended last break at 9:51.Now typing up this material the next day, I must say that my reading of the clock may not have been entirely accurate; it sat on a shelf behind me and I merely looked quickly over my shoulder.I was so surprised by the statement that I did not think to make absolutely sure of the reading.</td><td>(赛斯 10:12 发表了这个令人惊讶的声明，从我们上次 9:51 休息结束只有 21 分钟。现在，在第二天打出这份资料时，我必须说，我当时看的时间可能并不准 确；它就在我后面的架子上，我只是很快的回头瞥了一眼。这个说法使我非常惊 讶，我不完全确定我看到的时间是正确的。</td></tr><tr><td>(However, I did take down three fill closely-written pages of material during this time.This included pauses during Jane's dissertation, besides the regular-paced rhythm she uses.Therefore it seems plausible to us that some sort of time foreshortening may have taken place.Note that I had also remarked at the end of the first break how the time seemed to fly, and commented upon the amount of material we were accumulating. )"</td><td>(但是，我真的在这段时间记下了三页密密麻麻的资料。除了珍的常规节奏外， 还包括了珍传述过程中的停顿。因此，发生了某种时间的缩短，对于我们来说似 乎是蛮合理的。请注意，我还在第一次休息结束时作了记录，说时间过得飞快， 并评论了我们所积累的资料的数量。)</td></tr><tr><td>The strange thing incidentally about your flying saucers is not that they appear, but that you can see them.As science advances on various planes the inhabitants of the various planes learn to travel between planes occasionally, while carrying with them the manifestations of their home station.</td><td>关于你们偶然看见的飞碟，奇怪的不是它们的出现，而是你们能看见它们。随着 科学在各个层面上的发展，各个层面的居民也学会了偶尔在层面之间旅行，并随 身携带他们本站的那些显化。</td></tr><tr><td>This is complicated in the telling.As I mentioned they carry their own particular camouflage with them.You recognize it as not your own.Taking off at right angles involves another one of your natural laws which are not natural laws, but seem to be because this is how things look from where you are.I'll take this up at a later date if I do not go into it in the later part of this discussion.</td><td>这说起来很复杂。正如我说的，它们带着它们自己特定的伪装。你们认出那不是 你们自己的。直角式的起飞涉及到你们另一个自然规律，那不是真的自然规律， 只是从你所在之处看起来似乎是。如果我在本节的后段没谈到这部分，我日后会 再讲。</td></tr><tr><td>You may as well take a break while you have the chance.</td><td>有机会你不妨休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt, you can stop playing ring around the rosy.</td><td>鲁伯，你可以停止围着玫瑰绕圈子了。(译注: ring around the rosy 一种游戏，)</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:20.Seth referred to Jane's habit of pacing endlessly around the room as she talked.Although her voice sounded normal to me, Jane said that during this session even so she has a subjective feeling that her voice is different, and that sometimes it is a strain to pause in the middle of a monologue to speak to me as herself and not Seth.At these times she reports that she would rather nod her head to a remark or question of mine, so as not to break her continuity with Seth.Jane resumed dictation at 10:28.)</td><td>(10:20。赛斯说的是，珍在说话时不停地在房间来回踱步的习惯。她的声音我听 起来很正常，珍说，即使如此，她在本节课期间，有一个主观的感觉，觉得她的 声音不一样，在独白中暂停下来，以她自己而不是赛斯和我说话是很吃力的。在 这些时候，她说，她宁愿点一下头，来回应我的一句话或问题，以免打断她与赛 斯的连续性。珍 10:28 继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>The inner senses are actually the channels through which the entire composition of any particular plane is appreciated and actually maintained.It is through the inner senses that the mental enzymes are enabled to act upon the vitality which is, as I have said, the structure of the universe itself.</td><td>内在感官实际上是通道，经由这些内在感官，任何特定层面的整体构成，才都得 到了理解和实际的维护。正是通过内在感官，精神酵素才能作用于生命力，如我 所说的，生命力是宇宙自身的结构。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner senses in other words are the means, the mental enzymes are the tools, and the vitality is the actual material that forms the universe as a whole, the apparent divisions within it, the apparent boundaries of the various divisions, and the diverse materials within each division.Again, the different materials within each division are only camouflages formed by the inner senses upon the material itself.</td><td>换句话说，内在感官是途径，精神酵素是工具，生命力则是形成宇宙做为一个整 体的实际材料，也是形成宇宙内的明显分类、分类之间的明显边界，以及各种分 类中形形色色物质的实际材料。再说一次，在每一个分类之内的不同的物质，只 是由内在感官在物质本身上形成的伪装。</td></tr><tr><td>I still haven't gone completely into our fifth dimension discussion, but I am rounding out our imaginary structural universe in such a way that the fifth dimension material will fit in almost effortlessly when the time comes.You have already been given a tremendous portion of material this evening.I hit upon the foreshortened time idea to save you actual practical time that you might wish to use in other matters.I will go along with it as far as I can and still achieve the best results, that is, it may tire you in ways that I am not aware of, though I doubt it.In this case I should of course dispense with it.</td><td>我还没有完全进入我们第五维度的讨论，但我正在完善我们想象中的结构宇宙， 以这样一种方式，一旦时机成熟，第五维度的资料将几乎毫不费力地契入其中。今晚你们已经得到大量的资料。我提出了缩短时间的想法，以便为你们节省实际 的时间，你们可能希望将这些时间用于其他事项。我将尽可能地配合它，并仍然 取得最好的结果，也就是说，它可能会以我没有意识到的方式使你疲劳，尽管我 对此表示怀疑。但如果让你疲劳了，我当然会放弃它。</td></tr><tr><td>("I feel okay, Seth.

When the flying saucer as you prefer to call it starts out toward its destination, the atoms and molecules that structurally compose it, and which are themselves formed by vitality, are more or less aligned according to the pattern inflicted upon it in its own territory.Now as this enters your plane a distortion occurs.The actual structure of the craft is caught in a dilemma of form.It is caught between transforming itself completely into earth's particular camouflage pattern, and retaining its original pattern.The earthly viewer attempts to correlate what he sees with what he supposedly knows or imagines possible, in the little he knows of the universe.</td><td>飞碟的现形，来自于目前在科学技术上，比地球更先进得多的层面。然而，这仍 不是一个精神科学的层面。所以，伪装用具或多或少可见，令你们惊讶。现在， 生命力从一种明显的形式，转到另一种形式的倾向是如此强烈，以至于你们看到 的飞碟，既不是在你们层面所见到的样子，也不是它所来自的层面的原来面貌。发生的情况是这样的，一旦你们喜称的飞碟朝目的地出发，构成飞碟结构的原子 和分子---—它们本身也是生命力形成的—---或多或少与自己领地加诸其上的模式一致。现在，当它进入你们的层面，变形发生了。飞行物的实际结构卡在形式的 两难之境。它卡在完全转变成地球特定的伪装模式和保留其原有模式之间。地球 的观看者，以他对宇宙知之甚少的情况下，试图把他看到的与他认为理应知道， 或可能想象的东西，联结在一起。</td></tr><tr><td>What he sees is something between a horse and a dog and resembles neither.The craft retains what it can of its original structure and changes what it must.This accounts for much of the conflicting reports as to shape, size and color.The few times that the craft shoots off at right angles, it has managed to retain functions ordinary to it in its particular habitat.</td><td>他所看到的是介于马和狗之间的东西，但又两者都不像。飞行物尽可能地保留了 它原有的结构，并做了必要的改变。这对飞行物的形状、大小和颜色相互矛盾的 报告，占了很大的比例。少数几次的直角发射，是它维持住了在其特定栖息地的 普通功能。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not believe you will have any saucer landings for quite a while, not physical landings in the usual sense of the word.These saucers cannot stay on your plane for any length of time at all.The pressures that push against the vehicle itself are tremendous.It is literally caught between two worlds.This struggle to be one thing or the other is very great on any plane.To conform to the laws of a particular plane is a practical necessity, and at this time the flying saucer craft simply cannot afford to stay betwixt and between for any indefinite period.</td><td>我认为有相当一段时间都不会有任何飞碟着陆，不是通常字义上的那种实际着 陆。这些飞碟根本不可能在你们的层面停留任何片刻。施加在飞行器上的大气压 力是巨大的。它真的是夹在两个世界之间。要成为这样或那样的形式，这在任何 层面都是一场巨大的挣扎。符合特定层面的规则，是一种实际的必要，此时，飞 碟飞行器根本承受不了任何不确定时间的停留。</td></tr><tr><td>What they do is take quick glimpses of your planeâand hold in mind that the saucer or cigar shape seen on your planet is a bastard form having little relation to the structure as it is at home base.At a later date I may go into the inhabitants of that plane more thoroughly, but as it is I am not acquainted with them very much myself.There are so many things that you do not understand that I hope to explain to you.There are other things that you do not understand that I cannot explain to you, simply because they would be too alien now for your regular mode of thought.</td><td>他们做的只是快速地瞥一眼你们的层面，记住，在你们的星球上看到的碟形或雪 茄形是一个混合形式，和它们在本营的结构几乎没有关系。日后，也许我会更深 入地了解该层面的居民，实际上，我自己对它们并不熟悉。有太多事情你们不明 白，而我想向你们解释。还有一些事情你们不明白，而我也无法向你们解释，仅 仅是因为它们现在对你们的常规思维模式而言，太陌生。</td></tr><tr><td>("How about an example of what you mean?"</td><td>("举个例子，说明一下你的意思如何？"</td></tr><tr><td>(Once again Jane's voice became loud; but it was still quite recognizable as her voice. )"</td><td>(珍的声音变得大声；但仍然听得出是她的声音。)</td></tr><tr><td>One note along these lines.A planeâand I am using your term, I will try to think of a better oneâis not necessarily a planet.A plane may be one planet, but a plane may also exist where no planet is.One planet may have several planes.Planes may also involve various aspects of apparent time.This particular matter is too difficult to go into right now.However I will continue it later.</td><td>沿着这些思路有一个例子。一个层面，不一定是一个星球 - 我在使用你们的说法，我会尽量想一个更好的说法。一个层面可能是一个星球，但一个层面也可能 存在于没有星球的地方。一个星球上也可能有几个层面。层面，也可能涉及表面 时间的各个方面。现在谈这件事太难了。不过，稍后我会继续。</td></tr><tr><td>Planes can and do intermix without the knowledge of the particular inhabitants of either plane.I want to get away from the idea of a plane being a place.It may be in some cases but it is not always.

A plane is an isolation of elements where each element is given the most possible space in which to function.</td><td>在这些层面的特定居民不知情的情况下，层面与层面可以、并且也的确相互交 错。我想摆脱一个层面是一个地方的概念。在某些情况下可能是，但并非总是如此，层面可能就是时间。层面，不管你信不信，可能只是似乎独自存在的一丝生命力。层面显然是从宇宙的其余部分为了一段时间、为了一个原因而分离出来的东西。层面可能不复存在。层面也可能凭空冒出。层面是为了存有随着不同层 次，作为实现的模式而形成的。层面是有利于发展独特、特定能力和成就的一种气候。层面是因素的隔离，其中每个因素，都被给予它能发挥作用的最大可能的空间。</td></tr><tr><td>Planets have been used as planes and used again as other planes.A plane is not a cosmic location.It is oftentimes practical that entities or their various personalities visit one plane before another.This does not mean that one plane must necessarily be visited before another.A certain succession is merely more useful for the entity as a whole.</td><td>星球已被用作为层面，并可被再次地用作其他层面。层面不是宇宙中的一个位置。存有或存有的各种人格，一次造访一个层面，然后再造访另一个是很实际 的。这并不意味着，某个层面必须先造访，才能再造访另一个。有特定顺序，只 是对存有整体更有用。</td></tr><tr><td>In other terms you could also say that an entity visits all planes simultaneously, as it is possible for you to visit one particular state, one particular county, one particular city at one time.Also you might visit the state of sorrow and joy almost simultaneously, and experience both emotions in heightened state because of the almost immediate contrast between them.</td><td>用另一种说法，你也可以说，一个存有可同时造访所有的层面，因为你有可能在 同一时间造访一个特定的州，一个特定的县，一个特定的市。你也可能会几乎同 时拜访悲伤和喜悦，并经历两种情绪的强烈状态，因为它们之间几乎立即形成对 比。</td></tr><tr><td>In fact, the analogy of a plane with an emotional state is much more valid than the analogy between a plane and a geographical state.Particularly since emotional states take up no room.</td><td>事实上，用情绪状态来比喻层面，比用一个地理状态来比喻要有效得多。尤其是 情绪状态不占用空间。</td></tr><tr><td>("Seth, when you were speaking to us as Frank Watts in the 2nd session, you said you came from the state of sorrows.</td><td>("赛斯，当你在第二节课以弗兰克·沃茨身份与我们说话，你说你来自于悲伤状态。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane dictated the answer in a loud firm voice.)</td><td>(珍以大声又坚定的声音传述回答。)</td></tr><tr><td>Frank Watts did indeed come from the state of sorrow.He was a makeup personalityâthat is, through Frank Watts I had to make up for past errors.Never a pretty proposition.These people who seem borne from sorrow to sorrow are often of this type.I should not make light of Frank Watts, since almost literally he redeemed me.This plane for Frank Watts was a plane of sorrow.I will of course make it all up to him, or try to.He has absolutely no sense of humor.</td><td>弗兰克·沃茨确实来自于悲伤状态。他是一个弥补人格，也就是说，我必须透过弗 兰克·沃茨，弥补过去的错误。这从来就不是一个好主意。那些似乎从忧伤承受到 忧伤的人，通常都是这种类型。我不应该轻视弗兰克·沃茨，因为几乎就是他救赎 了我。这个层面，对弗兰克·沃茨而言，是个悲伤的层面。当然，我将弥补他，或 设法那样做。他毫无幽默感。</td></tr><tr><td>I have seen Ruburt glance at the clock.You may take a break or end the session, as you choose.I would say that you had enough material to keep you busy.</td><td>我看见鲁伯瞄了时钟一眼。你可以休息或结束课程，自己决定。我想说的是，你 有足够的资料让你忙。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:28.We were both very tired by now, Jane especially.We decided to end the session with one more question.During this answer Jane spoke in a low and quiet voice.Resume at 11:30.</td><td>(11:28 休息。现在，我们都累了，尤其是珍。我们决定用一个问题来结束课程。在这回答中，珍用低沉而平静的声音说话。11:30。</td></tr><tr><td>("Seth, what do you think about Jane talking to the students at Elmira College this afternoon?")</td><td>("赛斯，你怎么看珍今天下午在艾尔迈拉学院与学生的谈话？")</td></tr><tr><td>I didn't hear her speak.I know she didn't do as beautifully as she does for me in your own living room, and I am sure she spoke in her own voice.Nevertheless I understand she came up against a Frank Watts in poet's clothingâa shocking experience for anybody.She always did like to teach, and this ability is one of the carry-through traits of her various personalities.</td><td>我没听她说话。我知道她的表现不像在自家客厅为我做的那么漂亮，我确定她是 用自己的声音说话。不过，据我理解，她碰到了一个诗人版本的弗兰克·沃茨 -

As I knew of your York Beach experience, I also knew of other occurrences through the past few years.</td><td>这里涉及的东西比初看之下还要多得多。这个资料可能不像你的飞碟那样令人吃 惊，但它可能非常有用。现在，我已经看到你在不同时间和场合的挣扎，但我无 法让你听到我，我知道你在约克海滨的经历，我也知道过去几年发生的其他事件。</td></tr><tr><td>The ego must sit lightly, otherwise it can smother the talent that lies beneath.This is very properly your talent, your talent as a personality at this particular time.However, you are also more than you know.Your subconscious is a greater part of you than you know, and the ego is nothing more than the topmost portion of the subconscious.There is after all no dividing line, and you are as much your subconscious as you are your ego, and more.</td><td>自我必须轻轻地坐着，不然它能窒息底下的才能。这的确就是你的才华，你在这 个特定时期作为一个人格所拥有的才华。不过，你也比你知道的你更多。你的潜 意识是比你知道的更大的一部分，自我只不过是潜意识的最表层。毕竟根本没有 分界线，你是你的自我，你也是你的潜意识，而且不仅只于此。</td></tr><tr><td>Now when this ego becomes overly concerned over practical matters it becomes overly conditioned to negative responses.The outer senses are not as quick or as fluent.The creative energies build up their thickly-dimensioned pseudo realities of pain.For a certain amount of time, according to your condition, they automatically create the patterns of fear that belong to the ego.</td><td>当自我变得过度关切实际的事物时，它会过度调整自己来迁就那些负面的回应。外在感官没那么快或那么流畅。创造的能量，聚积起厚密的痛苦伪实相。在一定 时间内，根据你的状态，它们会自动创造出属于自我的恐惧模式。</td></tr><tr><td>These fears do not belong to the subconscious.Then these materializations of panic and pain play about the physical body, projected by the ego and stealing the powers of the subconscious mind from their natural constructive tasks to do so.In other words, the ego becomes a tool to disrupt rather than to create.</td><td>这些恐惧并不属于潜意识。那么，这些显化的恐慌和痛苦，戏弄着由自我所投射 的形体肉身，窃取了潜意识心智的力量，这些原本是用来做建设性的任务。换句 话说，自我变成了破坏而非创造的工具。</td></tr><tr><td>In the past you did not understand properly this relationship.You understood the destructive tendencies but you placed them in the subconscious.The endless or seemingly endless circle need not occur now, or in the future.This dissociation of which Ruburt has spoken to you is an excellent discipline that will insure your use of energy in the best possible manner.I am not suggesting that the ego be ignored in any manner, merely that the tool is not allowed to become the master.</td><td>过去你没有正确地理解这关系。你理解破坏性的倾向，但你把它们放在潜意识 内。自今而后，这无止境或看似无止境的循环都无需再发生。鲁伯跟你提过的解 离，是个极佳的训练，可以确保你以最好的方式使用能量。我不是建议你以任何 方式忽略自我，只是别让工具喧宾夺主。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take a break.</td><td>我建议休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:43.During break Jane's voice abruptly returned to its normal tone.She resumed dictating at 9:50. )"</td><td>(9:43。在休息期间珍的声音突然恢复到正常音调。9:50 继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>You see, dear Joseph, the subconscious and the ego, of course, are both you.For simplicity's sake I will speak of the ego and the subconscious, though they are actually one.The subconscious forms and projects the materializations of the ego as a tool to enable it to attain its goals.When these goals and talents are attributed to the ego alone they are so to speak decapitated.</td><td>你看，亲爱的约瑟，潜意识和自我，当然都是你。为了简便起见，我才说自我和 潜意识，实际上它们是一体。潜意识形成并投射物质化的自我，使其能够成为实 现其目标的工具。当这些目标和才能单单被归因于自我时，它们可以说被斩首 了。</td></tr><tr><td>(By now, Jane's voice had resumed its deeper tone. )"</td><td>(现在，珍的声音又回到深沉的音调。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your own subconscious is the fountain of your individuality and personality.From it springs your talent.When the ego becomes too concerned with daily matters, with worry in other words, then the works of the tool become clogged.It becomes ineffective.Dissociation, and I will give you many ways of achieving it, unclogs the tool and is absolutely necessary.The freely working subconscious, or the inner you, is completely capable of taking care of all practical considerations, and will use the ego as a tool to see that this is done.</td><td>你自己的潜意识，是你的个人性和人格的源泉。你的才华从那里涌现。当自我变 得过于关注日常事物，换句话说，太担心，那么工具的作用就会被堵塞。变得无 效。解离，我会给你很多达到解离的方法，疏通工具是绝对必要。自由运作的潜 意识，或者说内在的你，完全有能力照顾到所有实际的考虑，也会把自我当作工 具来检视确定完成结果。</td></tr><tr><td>Dissociation puts the power back where it belongs.Ruburt's seemingly impractical suggestions in the past have been much more practical than some of your intellectual so-called practical conclusions.At the time Ruburt felt intuitively the importance of dissociation but didn't know how to achieve it.</td><td>解离可以把力量归回原处。鲁伯过去那些看似不切实际的建议，远比那些知识分 子所谓的实践结论要实用得多。鲁伯总是直觉地感受到解离的重要性，但不知如 何做到。</td></tr><tr><td>A trip of course was the easiest method and Ruburt hit upon it.Daily methods of dissociation are extremely practical and beneficial.You will notice within a few week's time, if not sooner, an added energy.So-called impulses on your part are often quelled because your ego finds them impractical.The subconscious knows its own meat and sauce, and the best means for its own nourishment.</td><td>旅行当然是最简单的方法，鲁伯碰巧发现了它。日常的解离方法非常实用和有 益。你会在几星期内，甚至更早，发现自己新增的能量。你自己那部分的所谓冲 动，往往因为你的自我认为不切实际而被🗎平。潜意识知道自己的肉和酱，知道 滋养自己的最佳手段。</td></tr><tr><td>Begin the yoga exercises and follow them faithfully.Your few experiences with autosuggestion upon falling asleep have been ego-bound.Think of this in terms of muscle-bound and you will see what I mean.Be in a drowsy state and suggest, Ruburt, suggest, Joseph; do not attempt to bully or command the subconscious.Suggestions are all that are needed.Your love of nature, Joseph, and Ruburt your love of nature, is another method of dissociation, or can be if you use it as such.</td><td>要开始瑜伽的练习，并忠实地遵循它。你的几次入睡后自动暗示的经验，一直都 是受困于自我的。你用肌肉僵硬的说法来想，就会明白我的意思。要在昏睡状态 下做暗示，鲁伯，暗示，约瑟；不要试图去霸凌或命令潜意识。暗示就足够了。你们对自然的热爱，约瑟，鲁伯，你们对自然的爱，是另一种解离的方法，或者

"</td><td>狗的病是初期，在任何情况下，你都不可能长期维持牠的健康。我想明确地指 出，动物当然确实具有维持自身健康的能量，但是通常来说，动物在情感上依附 的人类生命力，大大增强了这种能量。事实是，在他最需要的时候，你无法给你 的狗那额外的情感活力。无需自责。那超出了你所能掌控的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Our dog Mischa was 11 years old when he died of kidney failure.)</td><td>(我们的狗米沙 11 岁时死于肾功能衰竭。)</td></tr><tr><td>Animals, like people, sense when they are a burden, and the dog sensed that he was a burden, and also something of a nuisance.I would have preferred that you did not ask me this question, but since you did and since you both loved the dog, it deserves an answer.</td><td>动物和人一样，当牠们觉得自己是个负担时，牠们是有感觉的，你的狗感觉到牠 是一个负担，也给人带来麻烦。我宁愿你没有问我这个问题，既然你问了，而且 你们俩都爱狗，那应该给个答案。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt, or I will say Jane now, strongly resented your mother, Joseph, on that Thanksgiving directly before the animal's death.And rightly so, since the strong negative suggestions given by her actually represented a turning point, and not a good one.The suggestion acted upon you and Jane, as well as upon the dog.</td><td>鲁伯，或者我现在会说珍，对你的母亲强烈不满，约瑟，那正好是狗死亡之前的 感恩节。没错，正是这样，因为她给出那强烈的负面暗示，实际上代表了一个转 折点，并且不是一个好的转折点。这个暗示对于你和珍起了作用，对狗也起了作 用。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest again that you take a break, because of the emotional content of this material.However, directly after the break I want to tie this in with personal responsibility, as far as healthy emotional states are concerned.</td><td>因为这个资料的情绪内容，我再次建议休息一下。但在休息后，就健康的情绪状 态而言，我想将此与个人的责任联系在一起。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:06.Resume with Jane dictating at 11:16.)</td><td>(11:06。珍 11:16 继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>Dissociation will blot out negative suggestions and is extremely beneficial.Nor is it difficult to achieve.It was impossible, Joseph, for your parents to even be decent when you returned from Florida for the same reason that you and Ruburt were unable to help your Mischa in his time of need.You were using all available energies to fight nervous projections, and therefore could not help maintain what was real.</td><td>解离会清除负面暗示，是极端有益的。也不难做到。约瑟，当你从佛罗里达回来 时，你的父母甚至不可能是像样的父母，这是同样的原因，你和鲁伯无法在米沙 需要的时候帮助牠。你正在使用所有可用的能量在对抗焦虑的投射，因此无法维 护真实的境况。</td></tr><tr><td>Dissociation, and I will give you further training along this line, will enable you to bear your parents and to help them.Without it you cannot help them, and sometimes even add to their burdens.You have developed somewhat in this area lately on your own, and with Ruburt's help.From you Ruburt has received and is receiving necessary aids in self-discipline and control, which are necessary to channel the strong intuitional abilities.</td><td>解离，我会沿着这个思路提供你进一步的训练，将使你能够容忍你的父母并能帮 助他们。没有它，你无法帮助他们，有时甚至会增加他们的负担。你最近在这方 面，靠着自己和鲁伯的帮助，已经有所长进。从你那里，鲁伯已经收到并正在接 收必要的自律和控制的帮助，这对于传导强大的直觉能力是必不可少的。</td></tr><tr><td>From Ruburt you are receiving needed freedoms and necessary confidence in your own intuitional powers.There are strange aspects, or should I say contradictory aspects, in your personality.For instance intuitively you have always felt a unity with nature, yet at the same time you distrusted what could not be proven in material terms.You had a natural affinity with things behind nature, that is you sensed the spirit of nature, and at the same time you had a tendency to distrust what you could not actually see, smell or touch.</td><td>在你自己的直觉能力方面，你正在从鲁伯那里收到需要的自由、和必要的信心。你的性格中有一些奇怪的面向，或者我应该说矛盾的面向。比如说，在直觉上你 一直感觉与自然为一体，但同时你又不信任在物质上无法证实的东西。你与在自 然背后的东西有自然的亲切感，就是说，你感知到自然的灵[spirit]，而在同时， 你有不信任无法实际看见，嗅到或触及的东西的倾向。</td></tr><tr><td>"This is certainly contradictory.Fantasy left you cold.I say this icily.Intellectually you would have no part in it, yet your imagination spun its fantastic web despite the fact that you believed in neither fantasy or web.Your artwork showed promise from the beginning.Your imagination was rich and varied.But you so feared your present mother's sense of exaggeration, that led often to sheer though unwitting lies and dishonesty, that you denied the capacity of the imagination lest it also lead you into ways of deceit. "</td><td>这当然是矛盾的。幻想引不起你的兴趣。我冷酷地这样说。从理智上讲，你不会 参与其中，但你的想像力却编织了它梦幻之网，然而你既不相信幻想，也不相信 网。你的艺术作品从一开始就显示出有前途。你的想象力丰富而多变。但你太害 怕你这一世母亲的夸张感，那经常导致非故意却纯粹的谎言与不诚实，以致你否 认了你想象的能力，以免它也把你引入到欺骗的歧途。</td></tr><tr><td>This of course happened at a young age.At the same time as a young child you almost adored your mother.This led to these conflicting feelings toward freedom of the subconscious and of the imagination.Reinforcing this unfortunate circumstance, we have the carry-over distrust of impulse from the Denmark existence.Ordinarily the last life before this would have adequately compensated for the Denmark experience, but the mother situation in this life reawakened the fear of giving in to impulse, and tended to over strengthen the desire for discipline, which was based on fear.</td><td>这当然是发生在你小时候。你小时候，对你母亲几乎是崇拜。因此你对潜意识自 由和想象力自由有这些相互冲突的感觉。从丹麦那一世带来的对冲动的不信任， 强化了这个不幸的情况。按说，你的前一世已完全弥补了丹麦那一世的经历，但 你母亲在这一世的处境，再次唤醒了那屈服于冲动的恐惧，这导致了过于强化对 自我约束的渴望，而这仍是源于恐惧。</td></tr><tr><td>I hope to use tonight's occasion to do a good bit of work along this personal line, if this meets with your approval.</td><td>如果你同意，我希望今晚能多谈一点个人方面的事。</td></tr><tr><td>("All right, please continue.")</td><td>("好吧，请继续"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your parents, unwittingly of course, can do you much harm.I use the name Jane now rather than Ruburt for the sake of convenience.Jane is dissociated to some degree as far as your parents are concerned.You can trust her intuition and judgment along these lines.In Florida she said often, whether you remember it or not, that they would not be as pleased to see you return as you supposed.At a later date I will go into her terrific demonstration at that occasion in Florida.</td><td>你的父母可能会给你造成很大的伤害，当然，他们自己并不知道。为了方便，我 现在用珍，而不用鲁伯这个名字。就你的父母而言，珍在某种程度上已经解离 了。在这方面你可以信任她的直觉和判断力。不管你是否记得，在佛罗里达时她 常说，他们并不像你以为的那样高兴看到你回来。以后我会谈谈她在佛罗里达州 那次精彩的展示。</td></tr><tr><td>Also her strong feeling that you should borrow money and get an apartment or flat or whatever you call it, was the best advice you could have been given.She was vehement and in tears over this on one occasion.Again this did not seem a practical solution.Looking back, can you not agree with me that it was a much more practical solution than the one you ultimately chose?</td><td>还有，她强烈地感觉，你应该借钱买间公寓或平房或随便你怎么称呼的东西，那 是你能得到的最好的建议。有一次她还为此激动地落泪。再次，这对你似乎仍不 是一个可行的解决方案。回头看看，你难道不承认，比你最终选择的那个，这是 更加实际的解决方案么？</td></tr><tr><td>If it seems I am hitting you over the head with a small hammer, it is only because tonight I am dealing with you.Ruburt, believe me, will get his turn.This material is meant in no way to corrode your confidence, but to show you past mistakes which you have already begun to remedy.More than others, the two of you operate as a team.For this reason it is necessary that you understand what your particular strengths and weaknesses are, and to know in which field of endeavor you can depend upon various abilities and avoid various pitfalls.</td><td>如果看起来我似乎一直在用小锤子打你的头，那只是因为今晚我只针对你的事。相信我，会轮到鲁伯的。这资料绝无意腐蚀你的信心，只是在指出你已经开始纠 正的过去的错误。最重要的是，你们俩是以一个团队在运作。基于这个理由，你 们有必要知道自己特定的强项和弱点是什么，并知道在哪个领域努力可以依赖自 己各方面的能力，并避免种种陷阱。</td></tr><tr><td>For your ego Joseph the unspoken but strong advice you gave Jane, who was carried away in Elmira at the radio station, this advice was excellent and saved you both much pain.However, she heeded it, therefore it helped you both.Had you heeded hers in Miami or even later in Sayre, you would have saved yourself what really can only be called an agonizing blow.If you are not completely exhausted then take a break and I will continue.If you are way down by tonight's lecture you may call it a day.</td><td>就你的自我而言，约瑟，你给珍的那没有明讲的强烈建议，在艾尔迈拉电台那次 让她有点忘形，这个建议非常好，免去了你们很多痛苦。不管怎样，她听从了， 因此帮了你们俩。假如在迈阿密，甚至后来在塞尔，你也听从了她的建议，就有 可能避免真的可说是惨痛的打击。如果你还没累垮，那就休息一下，我还会继 续。如果今晚的说教让你觉得很丧气的话，那就到此为止。</td></tr><tr><td>("No, I'd rather continue.")</td><td>("不，我宁愿继续"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your Malba spoke

closer at hand, and therefore it is necessary that you both learn the best way to handle that situation.Dissociation will help particularly in Ruburt's case, since already it is being practiced and can be relied upon to some extent.It is also easier for Ruburt to practice dissociation since it is Joseph's parents who are involved.</td><td>约瑟的问题近在手边，因此，你们俩都必须学会最佳的应对方法。解离有帮助， 尤其是就鲁伯的例子来说，因为已经实践过，并且在一定程度上可以信赖。还有 她面对的是约瑟的父母，练习解离就容易一些。</td></tr><tr><td>I would suggest therefore that Ruburt determine your relationship with Joseph's parents for now until Joseph catches up so to speak.Joseph's mother is particularly difficult to handle since it is against her emotionalism that Joseph first rebelled.He is in a difficult position now.</td><td>因此我建议，现在先由鲁伯来确立与约瑟父母的关系，直到约瑟赶上来。约瑟的 母亲特别难处理，因为约瑟首先反抗的就是她的情绪化。他现在处境艰难。</td></tr><tr><td>"It is true that because Ruburt is now a woman, and because Ruburt dislikes his own mother so vehemently, that some problems do arise between the two women.That is, Jane and Joseph's mother.Nevertheless this can be handled.As for your life before this time Joseph, this is hardly the time to go into it.It was however relatively calm.

she had a few periods of loudness.</td><td>(这是我们迄今为止最长的课，结束后，我们都很累。珍抽了 16 支烟。她的声音大部分时间是正常的，有几次声音很大。</td></tr><tr><td>(Gratis)</td><td>(自动回答)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening, chicks.</td><td>晚安，小宝宝们。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.What do you think of my performance last night?")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯。你觉得我昨晚的表现怎么样？")</td></tr><tr><td>Very good indeed if you are referring to the hypnosis session.</td><td>如果你指的是催眠治疗，那确实非常好。</td></tr><tr><td>Your condition following your first exercise bout should have showed you how badly you were in need of the treatment.When I suggested that you dissociate I didn't mean that you should break up in pieces.</td><td>你在第一次锻炼后的状况应该表明你是多么需要治疗。当我建议你解离的时候， 我并不是说你应该四分五裂。</td></tr><tr><td>At times the ego can hold you in a tight vice, which the dissociation breaks.This is what happened after your exercises.You have been doing very well, for you, in allowing yourself psychic freedom.However conscious fears cause the ego to tighten its grasp and some effects of this nature were starting up again.This is why I suggested that you begin these exercises now.The fact that the fearful ego was beginning to tighten explains your reaction to the exercises.The ego can build up around the subconscious vitality like a glacier, and these exercises melt it away.Even the prickles in your neck are like tiny picks chipping away at icy fears.</td><td>有时自我会把你紧紧地钳制住，而解离会打破这种局面。这就是你练习后发生的 情况。你一直做得很好，为你自己，允许自己灵性自由。有意识的恐惧使自我收 紧了它的控制，随之而来的一些影响就又开始了。这就是为什么我建议你现在就 开始这些练习。恐惧的自我开始收紧这个事实，解释了你对练习的反应。自我可 以像冰川一样堆积在潜意识的活力周围，而这些练习可以融化它。就连你脖子内 的刺也能像小刺儿般地在冰冷的恐惧中逐一剃除。</td></tr><tr><td>You are already much improved from just two exercises.You were released so quickly last night that quite literally you didn't know what happened.Incidentally while we are on this subject, often in the past when you thought you were dealing with a matter or a person in a dissociated manner, you were instead exhibiting a cold conscious detachment.</td><td>仅仅两次练习，你就已经有了很大的进步。昨晚你被释放得如此之快，以至于你 根本不知道发生了什么。顺便说一下，当我们谈到这个问题时，过去你常常认 为，你是在以一种解离的方式处理一件事或一个人，你其实是表现出一种冰冷的 意识抽离。</td></tr><tr><td>This is an unbending conscious pose of the ego, and not to be confused with the lithe subconscious detachment which is actually warm, flexible and expansive.That is, it can contain within it many elements, acknowledge them but be not affected by bad or negative suggestions or elements.</td><td>这是自我的一种不屈服的意识姿态，不要和轻盈的潜意识抽离混淆，潜意识实际 上是温暖的、灵活的、扩张的。也就是说，在它之内可以容纳许多元素，承认它 们，但不被不好的或负面的暗示或元素所影响。</td></tr><tr><td>As to Jane's feeling about the tree having certain consciousness, or course this is the case.What you have here is much latent energy and vitality and capacity, with much of it withheld or suspended momentarily.</td><td>至于珍觉得树有一定的意识，当然事实就是如此。这里有着很多潜在的能量、生 命力和能力，大部分被扣留或暂时中止。</td></tr><tr><td>The tree is of course dissociated in one manner.In some ways its living forces and consciousness are kept to a minimum.It is in a state of drowsiness on the one hand, and on the other hand it focuses the usable portion of its energy into being a tree.The state of consciousness involved here is dull as compared to the highly differentiated human ability in many ways.</td><td>树当然是以某种方式解离的。在某些方面，它的生命力和意识被维持在最低限度。它一方面处于瞌睡状态，另一方面它把可用的部分能量集中起来做为一棵 树。与许多方面都高度分化的人类能力相比，这里涉及到的意识状态，在很多方 面都是呆滞的。</td></tr><tr><td>However in some other manners the experiences of the tree are extremely deep, dealing with the inner senses which are, and properly, also properties of freedom.There is something here difficult for me to explain clearly.The inner senses of the tree have strong affinity with the properties of earth itself.They feel their growing.They listen to their growing as you listen to your own heartbeat.They experience this oneness with their own growth, and they also experience pain.The pain however while definite, unpleasant and sometimes agonizing, is not of an emotional nature in the same way that you might experience pain.</td><td>然而在其他一些方式上，树的体验是极其深刻的，它涉及到内在感官，而这些内 在感官，正确的说，也是树木的属性。这里有一些东西我很难解释清楚。树的内 在感官与大地本身的属性有很强的亲和力。它们感觉到自己的生长。它们倾听自 己的成长，就像你倾听自己的心跳一样。它们用自己的成长体验这种合一，它们 也体验疼痛。然而尽管疼痛是确定的，不愉快的，有时是痛苦的，但它不像你可 能体验到的痛苦，那样具有情绪性质。</td></tr><tr><td>In some ways it is even a deeper thing.The analogy may not be a perfect one, far from it, but it is as if your breath were to be suddenly cut off.In a manner this somewhat approximates pain for a tree.</td><td>在某些方面，这甚至是更深层的东西。这个比喻也许并不完美，其实差远了，就 是，这就像你的呼吸被突然切断一样。在某种程度上，这有点近似于一棵树的疼 痛。</td></tr><tr><td>The tree makes adjustments as you make adjustments. The tree listens to its growth up from the earth and listens also to the murmur of the growth of its roots beneath.It adjusts each root ending according to what impediments might lie in its way.Without the so-called mind of man, it nevertheless retains this inner consciousness of all its parts above and below the ground, and adjusts them constantly.</td><td>树和你一样也会做调整，树倾听着它从大地往上生长的声音，也倾听地下根系生 长的低语。它根据可能存在的障碍，调整每个根的尾端。虽没有所谓人那样的心 智，但它却对地上和地下的所有部分保持着这种内在意识，并不断地调整它们。</td></tr><tr><td>The tree is also inner aware of its environment to an astonishing degree.It maintains contact awareness and the ability to manipulate itself in two completely different worlds, so to speak, one in which it meets little resistance growing upward, and one composed of much heavier elements into which it must grow downward.Man needs artificial methods for example to operate effectively on land or in water, but the so-called unconscious tree manages very nicely in two worlds as diverse certainly as land and water, and makes himself a part of each.I am speaking now of a tree as a "he" for reasons that I will go into in a further discussion.</td><td>树对环境的内在觉察也达到了惊人的程度。它在两个完全不同的世界中保持着接 触的觉知和操纵自己的能力，可以说，一个是它往上生长几乎不会遇到阻力的世 界，一个是由重得多的元素所组成，必须向下生长的世界。例如，人需要人工的 方法才能在陆地或水中有效地操作，但所谓的无意识的树，却能在两个的确就像 水和陆地一样不同的世界中应对得相当好，并使自己成为其中的一部分。我现在 把一棵树说成是一个"他"，原因我会在以后的讨论中加以说明。</td></tr><tr><td>And as far as motion is concerned, the tree moves upward and downward.It is quite unfair to say that it cannot transport itself since it does so to an amazing degree, the roots and limbs moving in all directions.The inner senses of all plant life are well attuned, alert and very important.All these fragments have consciousness to a rather high degree, considering that man holds them in such ill repute.</td><td>而就运动而言，树是向上和向下运动的。说它不能移动自己是很不公平的，因为 它做到了惊人的程度，根和枝朝四面八方移动。所有植物生命的内在感官都很灵 敏，很警觉，非常重要。就人类对它们的低评价而言，所有这些片段，其实都有 相当高度的意识。</td></tr><tr><td>If you will remember what you know of the trance state, you are for example in a light trance, able to maintain awareness of yourself, your environment and your place in it.You simply behave somewhat differently, not bestirring yourself in any direction unless the suggestion to do so be given you.</td><td>如果你还记得你所知道的恍惚状态，比如你在轻度恍惚状态中，能够保持对自 己、环境和自己在所处之地的觉知。你只是行为有些不同，除非有人暗示你，否 则，你不会在任何其他方向激励你自己。</td></tr><tr><td>The awareness of plant life lies along these lines.In a deep trance there is oblivion afterward, that is the subject though fully aware of what is going on while in deep trance, can remember nothing of it afterward.The awareness of plant life is also like the awareness of a subject in deep trance.Except for the suggestion and stimulus received by regular natural forces on your plane, the plant life does not bestir itself in other directions.But like the subject in trance, our plant is aware.Its other abilities lie unused for the time and latent, but they are present.</td><td>植物生命的觉知就是沿着这样的方式进行。在深深的恍惚状态中，随后是遗忘， 也就是说，主体虽然在深层恍惚时，完全知道正在发生的事情，但之后却什么也 记不得。植物生命的觉知，就像主体处在深度恍惚中的觉知。除了从你们层面接 受一般的自然力量的暗示和刺激之外，植物生命不会在其他方向上自我激励。但 就像处于出神状态的主体，我们的植物是意识到的。它的其他能力暂时未被使用，是潜伏的，但它们是存在的。</td></tr><tr><td>The awareness is focused along certain lines.The energy is likewise focused.Much of the ability again is suspended as for a subject in a trance, but consciousness is present.Your hybrid plants merely demonstrate this susceptibility to new suggestion which your plant, like your susceptible trance subject, will gladly follow.I will have more to say along this road of thought, but am detoured for just a moment as to which fork to follow.</td><td>觉知沿着一定的路线集中。能量也以同样的方式聚焦。还是那句话，就像出神状 态的主体，大部分的能力是处于暂停状态，但意识是存在的。你们的混种植物只 是证明了这种对新暗示的敏感性，而你们的植物，如同易受影响的出神主体，会 很乐意跟随。顺着这条思路，我还有更多的话要说，暂时绕个路，看该走哪一条。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take a break.I always like to get you well worn in first.</td><td>我建议休息。我总是喜欢先磨你们一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:43. Jane felt that Seth wanted to go on, but had so many points of departure to choose from that he couldn't decide which to pursue first." I can feel him buzzing around," she said just before she resumed dictating at 9:50.)</td><td>(9:43 休息，珍感觉赛斯还会继续，但有这么多的资料点，他无法决定要选哪一个。就在继续传述之前，她说："我能感觉到，他在周围乱转"。9:50 传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>As you have probably supposed by now, there is consciousness in everything.Visible or invisible to you, each fragment of the universe has a consciousness of its own.Pain and pleasure, the strongest aspects of all consciousness, are experienced strongly by every fragment, according to its degree.Differentiation is of course various, and it is in the degree of differentiation that consciousness is different.</td><td>现在你可能已经猜到，万事万物都有意识。不管你看得见还是看不见，宇宙中的 每一个片段都有自己的意识。痛苦和愉悦，所有意识中最强烈的面向，都被每个 片段根据其自身的程度，强烈地体验。差异化当然是形形色色的，差异化程度的 不同，形成意识的不同。</td></tr><tr><td>In some fragments such as much plant life and vegetative life there is strong use of certain inner senses.Your rocks, Joseph, I will call vegetative.Rocks are far from lifeless.Other types of life, including your own, rely on the recognized outer senses.The ideal of course is a consciousness that is adept at using both the inner and outer senses fully.</td><td>某些片段，比如众多植物生命和植物性生命是强有力地在使用内在感官。你们的 岩石，约瑟，我会称之为植物性的。岩石远非是无生命的。其他类型的生命，包括你们的生命，都依赖于可识别的外在感官。当然，最理想的是一种善于充分使 用内在和外在感官的意识。</td></tr><tr><td>Your tree lives through its inner senses, experiencing many sensations and reacting to many stimuli of which you are unaware.Minute earth tremors, even the motion of small ants about its lower trunk, are recognized and experienced by tree consciousness.Such invisibilities as humidity, radioactivity and all electrical earthly values, are felt as quite real things by your tree and recognized as being separate from the tree itself.</td><td>你的树通过它的内在感官生活，经历许多感觉，对许多你不知道的刺激作出反 应。大地的细微震颤，甚至是小蚂蚁在树干低处的爬动，都被树的意识识别和感 知到。像湿度、放射性和地球上所有的电子值之类不可见的东西，都会被你们的 树感觉到是相当真实的东西，并认识到它们与树自身是分开的。</td></tr><tr><td>A tree knows a human being also.Not only for example by the weight of a boy upon its branches, but by the vibrations in the air as adults pass, which hit the tree's trunk at varying distances, and even by such things as voices.You must remember my earlier remarks about mental enzymes, and my remark that color can sometimes be heard and sight be seen.</td><td>树也知道人类。例如，透过一个男孩在树枝上的重量，透过一位成人经过时空气 中的振动，这些振动以不同的距离撞击树干，甚至也能透过声音来感知。你一定 还记得我先前说过的关于精神酵素的话，以及我说颜色有时可以被听到，影象可 以被看到。</td></tr><tr><td>In drawing up his list of so-called natural laws, I have said that man decided that what appeared to be cause and effect to him was therefore a natural law of the universe.Not only do these so-called laws, which are not laws, vary according to where you are in the universe, they also vary according to what you are in the universe.Therefore your tree recognizes a human being, though it does not see the human being in your terms.To a tree the laws are simply different.And if a tree wrote its laws of the universe, then you would know how different they are.</td><td>在列出所谓的自然法则时，我曾经说过，人类决定把在他看来是因果关系的定为 是宇宙的自然法则。这些所谓的法则—其实不是定律—不仅因你在宇宙中的位置 不同而不同，也因你在宇宙中的身份不同而不同。因此，你们的树知道人类，但 不是你们所说的看见人类，但它认识人。就一棵树来说，法则是完全不同的。如 果让一棵树写出它的宇宙法则，那么你就会知道它们是多么的不同。</td></tr><tr><td>The tree does not even build up an image of man, which is why this is difficult to explain.I have no intention of going deeper into this matter than you can follow at this time.Nevertheless the tree builds up a composite sensation which represents say an individual man.And the same tree will recognize the same man who passes it by each day.Beside the recognized outer senses, and the inner senses of which you are just now beginning to gain knowledge, there are other inner and even outer senses, which you are not quite ready to understand.</td><td>树连人的形象都没有建立起来，这就是为什么难以解释的原因。我无意在这个时 候深入探讨这个问题，你们也跟不上。然而，树建立了代表一个个体的综合感 知。而同一棵树，会认出每天经过它的同一个人。除了已认知的外在感官、以及 你们现在刚开始认知的内在感官之外，还有其他的内在甚至外在感官，你们还没 有准备好去理解。</td></tr><tr><td>They deal with finer distinctions than you know now, being somewhat of the nature of your body's ability to sense another person's aggression.As your body senses temperature changes so it also senses the psychic change not only of other human beings but also, believe it or not, of animals, and to a lesser extent it senses the psychic charge of plants and vegetative matter.Your tree builds up a composite of sensations of this sort, sensing not the physical dimensions of a material object, whatever it is, but the vital psychic formation within and about it.</td><td>它们处理比你现在所知道的更细微的区别，在某种程度上有如你身体的本能，能 感知他人的侵略性。就像你的身体感知温度的变化，树感知灵性的变化，不仅是 来自于人的灵性变化、而且，不管你信不信，也来自于动物，在较小的程度上， 它还感知植物和植物性物质的灵性电荷。树积聚这种综合感知，它感知的不是实 物的物理尺寸，不管它是什么，而是它内部和关于这物体的重要灵性构建。</td></tr><tr><td>Size however is sensed by a tree, perhaps because of its inherent concern with height.The table around which Ruburt now walks senses Ruburt even as Ruburt senses the table.At a later date I intend to go quite intensively into the means by which other fragments sense each other, and man.The abilities of the tree are latent in man as, dear Joseph, are the abilities latent in the tree.</td><td>然而，树能够感知到尺寸大小，也许是因为它与生具来的对高度的关注。鲁伯现 在绕着走的桌子能感知到鲁伯，一如鲁伯能感知到桌子。以后我打算相当深入地谈谈其他片段如何相互感知，以及如何感知人类。树的能力潜伏在人类身上，正 如，亲爱的约瑟，潜伏在树里的能力一样。</td></tr><tr><td>"Mans ego causes him to interpret everything else in the light of himself.He loses very much in this manner.The ego is definitely an advancement, but it can be compared to the bark of the tree in many ways.The bark of the tree is flexible, extremely vibrant, and grows with the growth beneath.It is a tree's contact with the outer world, the tree's interpreter, and to some degree the tree's companion. "</td><td>人的自我使他以自己的目光来解释一切。以这种方式他损失很多。自我绝对是一 种演化升级，但它可以在许多方面与树皮相类比。树皮有弹性，极富生命力，而 且随着底部的生长而成长。它是树与外界的联系，是树的铨释器，在某种程度上 也是树的伙伴。</td></tr><tr><td>"So should man's ego be.When man's ego turns instead into a shell, when instead of interpreting outside conditions it reacts too violently against them, then it hardens, becomes an imprisoning form that begins to snuff out important data, and to keep enlarging information from the inner self.The purpose of the ego is protective.It is also a device to enable the inner self to inhabit the physical plane.It is in other words a camouflage. "</td><td>人的自我也应如此。但人的自我却成了一个壳，它不是铨释外界条件，而是对外 界条件作出过于激烈的反应，这让自我变得僵硬，成为一种禁锢的形式，开始扼 杀重要的资讯，并瞒着内在自己持续扩大的信息。自我的目的是保护。自我也是 让内在自己存在于物质层面的装备。换言之，它是一种伪装。</td></tr><tr><td>It is the physical materialization of the inner self, but it is not meant to snuff out the inner self.If for example our tree bark grew fearful of the stormy weather and began to harden itself against the elements, in a well-meaning but distorted protective spirit, then the tree would die.The sunlight and so forth could never penetrate.The sap could not move upward for the trunk would solidify through and through, trying all the while to protect, and killing the tree with its obsessive kindness.</td><td>它是内在自己的实体化，但它不是要扼杀内在自己。比如说我们的树皮对暴风雨 产生了恐惧，在一种善意但扭曲的保护精神下，开始变硬以抵御风雨，那么这棵 树就会死亡。阳光和其他之类的将永远无法穿透。树液无法向上移动，因为树干 会彻底硬化，始终是试图保护，但偏执的善意却杀死了树。</td></tr><tr><td>"This is what the ego does when it reacts too violently to purely physical data on your plane.As a result it stiffens and you have, my well-meaning friend, the cold detachment with which you have faced the world.I do not want to digress here.I have certain points in mind for this evening.Nevertheless lest Ruburt thinks he is getting off scot-free, let me remind him that the tree's bark is quite necessary, cannot be dispensed withâbut I will get into that and into Ruburt at a later time. "</td><td>这就是自我在你的层面上对纯物理资料反应过于激烈时所做的事情。结果它僵化 了，我的善意的朋友，你就有了你面对世界的冷漠疏离。我不想在这里岔开话题。今晚我有一些要点。不过，为了避免鲁伯认为他可以逍遥法外，让我提醒 他，树皮是很有必要的，是不能舍弃的--不过，我以后再谈这个，还有鲁伯的事 情。</td></tr><tr><td>Take a break, and then I will have more to say about the bark which barks too loudly.</td><td>休息一下，关于树皮[bark]我还有更多的话要说，它们咆哮[bark]得太大声。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:26.Jane said she had stage fright this evening; why she does not know.She still wonders where the material is coming from, especially when she does not consciously know what she will say from one word to the next.Her eyes have been very dark this evening.</td><td>(10：26 休息。珍说她今天晚上怯场了，为什么她不知道。她还是不知道资料从哪里来，尤其是她在意识上并不知道自己从一个字到下一个字会说什么。今晚她 的眼睛一直很黑。</td></tr><tr><td>(She said she senses that Seth is hiding some material from her tonight, concerning the inner senses.Her voice has been pretty much her own tonight.She resumed dictating at 10:35.)</td><td>(她说她感觉到赛斯今晚对她隐瞒了一些资料，是关于内在感官。她今晚的声音 几乎是她自己的。她在 10:35 恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>The idea of dissociation could be likened to the slight distance between the bark and the inside of the tree.Here we do not have a rigid bark, as you should not have a rigid ego.We have instead a flexible bark, changing with the elements, protecting the inner tree or the inner self, but flexible, opening up or closing in rhythmic motion.The bark is so to speak outside our tree; and there is a small space between the inner tree and the bark.This small space is our dissociation.</td><td>解离的概念可以比喻为树皮和树的内部之间的微小距离。在这里，我们没有僵硬 的树皮，就像你也不该有一个僵硬的自我一样。我们反而有一个灵活的树皮，随着自然环境的变化而变化，保护内在的树或内在的自己，有弹性，在有节奏的运 动中张开或关闭。可以这么说，树皮在树的外面，而内在的树和树皮之间有一个 小小的空间。这个小空间就是我们的解离。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner tree continues to grow because the bark is flexible.Man lets his ego face the outer world as does the tree bark, and this is its purpose.Nevertheless the inner self, like the inner tree, must have room to expand.The tree bark makes allowances for good weather (here Jane pounded the table) though bad weather is repulsive to the bark.Nevertheless the bark makes whatever adjustments are necessary and is flexible.Forgive me if this is a trite analogy, I almost hate to say it, but it bends with the wind.It does not bend when there is no wind.Nor does it solidify, stopping the flow of sap to the treetop for fear the dumb tree, not knowing what it was up to, would bump its head against the sky.</td><td>内在的树继续生长，因为树皮是有弹性的。人让自我面对外部世界，就像树皮一 样，这是它的目的。然而内在的自己，就像内在的树一样，必须有扩张的空间。树皮为好天气留出了余地(珍在此敲击桌子)。虽然恶劣的天气让树皮很反感。但树皮还是会做出任何必要的调整，而且很灵活。原谅我这是一个老套的比喻， 我几乎不想说，但它随风而弯。没有风就不会弯曲。它也不会固化，停止树液流 向树梢，因为担心这棵笨树不知道要干什么，脑袋会不会撞到天空。</td></tr><tr><td>Neither should the ego react so violently that it remembers and reacts to past storms in the midst of clear and sunny weather.You can understand this analogy, Joseph.You know that such a tree bark would be death to the tree.What you must still understand is that the same applies to yourself.</td><td>自我也不应该反应如此激烈，以至于在晴空万里、阳光明媚的天气里，还回忆并 反应过去的风暴。你可以理解这个比喻，约瑟。你知道，这样的树皮对树来说是 死亡。你还必须明白的是，同样的道理也适用于你自己。</td></tr><tr><td>What Ruburt must learn is that it is equally ridiculous to act as if it is a summer day when snows are falling.The tree has enough sense not to show blossoms in the middle of a blizzard.However, the danger is stronger on your side.</td><td>鲁伯必须学会的是，在下雪的时候，表现得有如在夏日一般，是同样荒谬可笑 的。树有足够的判断力，不会在风雪中开花。然而，你这边的危险更大。</td></tr><tr><td>When you are overly concerned with physical matters, and even vital physical matters, you pull yourself in.And more ridiculous, you pull up your roots.A tree would never pull up its roots.I am not speaking now of pulling up your roots in terms of moving from one location to another.I am speaking of something akin to cutting off your roots from any nourishment whatsoever.</td><td>当你过分关注物质问题，甚至是攸关生死的物质事物时，你就会把自己拉下水。更可笑的是，你把自己的根拔了起来。一棵树绝不会拔起自己的根。我现在说的 拔起你的根，并不是指从一个地方搬到另一个地方。我说的是类似于切断你源于 根部的任何营养。</td></tr><tr><td>"We come again to the problem of practicality, and at the risk of repeating myself let me say that in the past Ruburt's seeming impracticality has been more practical than your intellectual practicality.This is merely because you have not trusted your egos ability to offer adequate protection.You have forced it into anxiety so that it overcompensates trying to protect you, and ends up half choking you to death. "</td><td>我们再来谈谈实用性的问题，冒着重复的危险，请允许我说，在过去，鲁伯的看 似不切实际，比你的理性实际更加实用。这仅仅是因为，你不相信你的自我意识 能够提供足够的保护。你把它逼得焦头烂额，使它过度补偿，试图保护你，结果 把你掐得半死。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you want to sit in the rocker?</td><td>你想坐摇椅吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(I must have been squirming again.

She first noticed this phenomena two sessions ago but for some reason never mentioned it to me.At times during a session her hands feel heavier and waterlogged, the fingers fatter, the palms thicker, so that when she makes a fist her hand has a different feel to her than ordinarily. "</td><td>(珍说，她现在在课程中靠着信仰或信任说话，这是她平时做不到的。另外，在传 递赛斯的信息时，她的手似乎"更胖"。她第一次注意到这一现象是在两节课 前，但由于某些原因从未对我提起过。有时在课程中，她的手会感觉更重、像浸在水里的木头，手指更胖，手掌更厚，所以当她握拳时，她的手有一种与平时不同的感觉。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane has long slim fingers with spaces easily observable between them close to the palms.Examining her hands midway through the session, we saw these spaces somewhat closed up; her index fingers also appeared to be thicker than usual.At the start of the session Jane removed her rings because they had become uncomfortably tight in the previous two.Inadvertently slipping a ring back on during a break, she had great difficulty getting it off Normally it is easily removed.</td><td>(珍的手指细长，靠近手掌的手指之间有容易观察到的空隙。中途检查她的手 时，我们发现这些空隙有些闭合，食指也比平时粗。在课程开始时，珍摘下了她 的戒指，因为前两次课中它们紧得令人不舒服。在休息的时候，她不经意间又戴 上了一枚戒指，她很难把它取下来，通常情况下，它很容易被取下来。</td></tr><tr><td>(In this session Jane displayed no voice effects of note. She did not smoke except at breaks and the hoarseness was minimized.To begin we sat at the board as usual, fingers on the pointer.Seth spelled out his greeting on the board but Jane began to receive him within immediately.Thus she dictated the entire session.</td><td>(珍在本节课，除了休息时间一直没有吸烟，嘶哑声减小了，没有显示出令人注 意的语音效果。课开始时，像往常一样坐在显灵板旁，手指放在显灵板的指针 上。赛斯在显灵板上拼写出他的问候，并且，珍立刻从内部开始收到信息。就这 样，她传述了整个课程。</td></tr><tr><td>(Gratis)</td><td>(自动回答)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>I would like to continue with some more personal data if this will not bother you.Any time you become uncomfortable you have only to say the word.I am not a doctor but I am certainly giving you a dose.</td><td>如果不会令你们不安的话，我想继续说更多的个人资料。任何时候你变得不舒 服，你只需要说一句话。我不是医生，但我肯定会给你一剂药。</td></tr><tr><td>I did not mean that Ruburt should handle all your personal matters by any means.Such a suggestion was not my intention.I merely mean that when Ruburt feels strongly one way or another about a particular situation that you should give the matter deep thought and consideration, since you can usually, not always but usually, trust his intuitions.</td><td>我真的不是在说，无论如何都应该是鲁伯处理你们的个人事务。这样的建议不是 我的本意。我只是在说，当鲁伯对某一特定情况有强烈的感觉时，你应该对这件 事情给予充分考虑，因为你通常可以相信他的直觉，虽然不一定，但通常是这样。</td></tr><tr><td>"I did suggest that for the present you trust Ruburt's intuitions in the matter of your parents while you caught up with the technique of dissociation.There is no need for you to follow Ruburt's lead in all directions.I merely want you to examine your own ideas as to what is practical, because often your ideas have been practical for the short term only, and in many cases though not all Ruburt's seemingly unpractical notions have been based on very practical psychological knowledge. "</td><td>我确实建议，目前，关于你父母的事情，你要信任鲁伯的直觉，同时你要抓紧时 间学习解离。没有必要方方面面都遵从鲁伯。我只是想让你审视一下自己的想法，什么是实际的，因为你的想法往往只在短期内是实际的，并且在多数情况 下，并不是鲁伯所有的看似不切实际的想法，都是基于非常实用的灵性知识。</td></tr><tr><td>For example had you left your last job when you were first very strongly tempted to do so, and when Ruburt urged you to do so, you would not have become sick in the way that you were.There would have been a period of financial strain but it would have been over by now, and it would have been a period of financial difficulties mainly.That is, you would have found yourself capable of dealing with the problem since you would not have used up so much energy as you tried to hold off the inevitable.</td><td>比如说，如果你在第一次受到非常强烈的诱惑时就离开了前一份工作，而鲁伯又 敦促你这样做的话，你就不会生那样的病。虽然会有一段经济紧张的时期，但现 在已经过去了，那主要是经济困难的时期。也就是说，你会发现自己有能力处理 这个问题，当你想抵挡不可避免的情况时，你不会耗费那么多精力。</td></tr><tr><td>In the latter case which you followed you allowed your psychic energies to drop to a very low and dangerous ebb, from which you are now just emerging.I have been dealing with you first since you were very ill, and I would like to give you some insight to prevent such an occurrence in the future.And you must remember that the tragic possibilities discussed in our previous session represent but one sample of such possibilities that are occurring constantly with every individual and every family.</td><td>紧接着下来，你让你的灵性活力降到了一个非常低的、危险的低潮，你现在才刚 刚从中走出来。自从你病重以来，我一直先和你打交道，我想给你一些启示，以 防止将来发生这样的事情。你一定要记住，我们上一堂课所讨论的悲剧的可能性，只是代表了一种可能的例子，这种可能性经常发生在每个人和每个家庭身上。</td></tr><tr><td>Because Ruburt has been somewhat annoyed with me and because I do not want to hurt either of you, let me say again that you averted many tragedies, and if you did not always take the easiest or the best course you have never taken the worst course, and you have never acted through malice.Now I hope Ruburt will stop yapping like an angry cur and let me continue.</td><td>由于鲁伯已经对我有些恼火，因为我不想伤害你们中的任何一个，让我再说一 遍，你们避过许多悲剧，如果你们没有总是采取最简单或最好的方法，你们也没 有采取最坏的方法，你们从来没有通过恶意来行事。现在，我希望鲁伯不要再像 个愤青一样叽叽喳喳，让我继续说下去。</td></tr><tr><td>"Because Ruburt's background in this life was particularly bizarre in a way and certainly unpleasant, he became beautifully efficient as far as sensing the approach of psychic storms is concerned and very adept at sensing moods, and also amazingly efficient in learning self-protective devices.It is true that Ruburt can also be trapped by his own capacity for protection.In his case this amounts to a stubborn refusal to see what he does not want to see.However this mechanism seldom actually goes haywire in this manner.This represents merely a possibility that could occur. "</td><td>因为鲁伯这一世的背景，在某种程度上特别诡异，当然也很不愉快，所以就感知 心灵风暴的来临而言，他的效率变得非常漂亮，而且非常善于感知情绪，学习自 我保护装置的效率也很惊人。的确，鲁伯也会被自己的保护能力所困。在他的情 况下，这相当于固执地拒绝看到他不想看到的东西。然而这种机制实际上很少会 以这种方式失控。这仅仅代表了一种可能发生的可能性。</td></tr><tr><td>"I intend to go into Ruburt's peculiarities at my leisure, and I will.Nevertheless it is still you, Joseph, with whom I will be concerned for a while. "</td><td>我打算在闲暇的时候去研究鲁伯的奇特之处，我也会这样做的。不过，眼下我还 是要先关注你一会儿，约瑟。</td></tr><tr><td>The fact remains that Ruburt's intuitions have been of fairly high quality.It is true that your particular talents can give variety and reason to many of Ruburt's ideas.In many cases you could for example accept Ruburt's basic intuitive impulse, and then make your own changes.For example you could have left your position at a much earlier time and then made your own plans accordingly.When you both are intuitively attracted to the same proposed move then in most cases it would be wise to make it.Because you are soâis the word wobbly?âafter your exercises I suggest a short break.</td><td>事实上，鲁伯的直觉是相当高明的。的确，你的特殊才能可以使鲁伯的许多想法 具有多样性和合理性。例如在许多情况下，你可以接受鲁伯的基本直觉冲动，然 后自己再做些改变。比如你可以在更早的时候离开你的职位，然后做出相应的计 划。当你俩都直觉地被吸引到同一个计划步骤时，那么，在大多数情况下，做出这个举动是明智的。因为你是如此-wobbly 这个词是摇摆不定吗？在你的练习之后，我建议你短暂的休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:25.I had done my yoga exercises at 8:30 and felt very relaxed and lightheaded.My handwriting was very fluid.Smoking a cigarette during break, Jane received the words "âand as far as mediums are concernedâ" but told Seth to wait until she had finished.She also admitted that she had been somewhat upset with Seth because of what he had told me the last two sessions; this I had not known.Jane resumed dictating at 9:30.)</td><td>(9:25 休息。我在 8:30 做了瑜伽练习，感觉非常放松，有点头晕。我的字写得非常流畅。珍在课间休息时抽了一支烟，并收到了词语" - 对于灵媒而言 - "，她告诉赛斯，等她抽完烟。她承认，她已经因为在过去的两节课中，因为赛斯对我 说过的话，而对他有些生气；我不知道这一点。珍 9:30 继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>As far as mediums are concerned, for that matter the term is rather ridiculous.From my point of view it is like saying that some people are breathers and some are not.Everyone is a medium, unwittingly and yet knowingly.It is well known to your scientists, or it should be, that you bring many things about without knowing how you do so.</td><td>就灵媒而言，就这一点而言，这个词相当可笑。从我的角度来看，好像是说，有 些人要呼吸，而有些人则不。然而，每个人都是灵媒，在不知情中，但又明明知 道。你们的科学家很清楚，或者说应该很清楚，就是，你们不太知道自己是怎么 做了这些事。</td></tr><tr><td>Your so-called mediums are simply people who know more about what they are doing.You are learning step by step how to gain access to abilities that you have always enjoyed, always used to some extent, and which have helped mold the exterior circumstances of your life and given your personality much of its meaning.You will learn more.You can use these abilities in a practical manner and you have already begun to do so to some extent.I have given you enough personal data for a time but I will add to this material as I see fit.</td><td>你们所谓的灵媒，不过是更了解自己在做什么的人。你正在一步步地学习如何获 得你一直喜欢的、一直在某种程度上使用的能力，这些能力帮助塑造了你生活的 外部环境，并赋予你人格许多意义。你会学到很多。你可以用很实际的方式使用 这些能力，你在某种程度上已开始这样做了。我已经给你们提供了足够多的个人 资料，但我会在我认为合适的时候，对这些资料进行补充。</td></tr><tr><td>Mental enzymes have much to do with psychic phenomena naturally, as they have to do with the transformation of energy on any level and of any kind.I will also continue with your fifth dimension material, add much to the time discussion, and go into some elements of existence on other planes that are different from your own.This will all take time and we have plenty of time, so there is no difficulty there.</td><td>精神酵素与灵异现象自然有很大的关系，因为它们与任何层面和任何种类的能量 转化有关。我还将继续第五维资料，在时间的讨论中增加很多内容，并探讨和你 们不相同的、在其他层面上的生存环境。这都需要时间，我们有足够的时间，所 以没有任何困难。</td></tr><tr><td>Mental enzymes are the transformers, and as I have said they are extremely important.I have spoken of the inner and outer senses to make our discussion easier.However you must know by now that there is no actual distinction between inner and outer.The apparent outer senses are merely concerned with the particular camouflage of a particular plane.The inner senses are concerned with vitalities beneath the camouflage.These inner senses, if I may use an analogy again, are like hidden underground trains that carry important fuel from one country to another.</td><td>精神酵素是转化器，我已经说过，它们极其重要。我讲了内在和外在的感官，以 使我们的讨论更容易。然而你们现在一定知道，内在和外在之间并没有实际的区 别。表面上的外在感官仅涉及特定层面的特殊伪装。内在感官关注的是伪装之下 的生命力。这些内在感官，如果我可以再用一个比喻的话，就像隐藏的地下火车，把重要的燃料从一个国家运到另一个国家。</td></tr><tr><td>In the various countries the fuel may be used for different purposes.The inhabitants of these imaginary countries may change the appearance of the fuel, but the fuel is all derived from the same source and supplies each various country, while the train itself travels deeply within each country and finds no barriers to keep it out.</td><td>在不同的国家，这些燃料可能被用于不同的目的。这些假想国家的居民可能会改 变燃料的外观，但燃料都是来自同一个源头，供应各个不同的国家，而火车本身 则深入每个国家内部，找不到任何障碍可以把它挡在外面。</td></tr><tr><td>I will go into this more deeply also.I am merely presenting a brief outline of the direction in which this material will go in the future.If you will ignore the apparent distinction between inner and outer senses you will get along at a faster rate.Even though they are not different things I must speak of them differently because they appear so on your plane.This is caused of course by the typical camouflage distortion effect, which occurs on almost every plane to some

later said that this phrase, camouflage distortion effect, was to be a very important one.)</td><td>(珍后来说，伪装扭曲效果，将是一句非常重要的话。)</td></tr><tr><td>The tree bark for example is not really divided from the rest of the tree, yet I must speak as if it were so divided because this is one of the apparent effects that you see, and I could not ignore what you insist was the evidence of your senses.The evidence of your senses is usually camouflage.Let that one sink in.</td><td>例如树皮与树的其他部分并没有真正的分开，但我却必须把它说成是如此分开 的，因为这是你所看到的明显效果之一，我不能忽视你所坚持的、作为你的感官 证据的东西。你感官的证据通常是伪装。让这事沉淀下来。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner senses deal with what actually is.The inner senses are the carriers of our fuel, that is, they can be likened to the various cars of our imaginary train.It takes some doing to be aware of this fuel, since it is so instantly transformed by the outer senses into the stuff of camouflage.The process involved is subconscious.You can hardly catch yourself at it, and yet with training you will be able to catch yourself in the act.</td><td>内在感官处理实际存在的东西。内在感官是我们燃料的载体，也就是说，它们可 以比作我们想象中的火车的各种车厢。这需要做一些事情才能觉知这种燃料，因 为它是如此瞬间地被外在感官转化为伪装的东西。这个过程是潜意识的。你很难 捕捉到自己的行为，但通过训练，你将能够捕捉到自己正在做的行为。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane tapped upon the table for emphasis.)</td><td>(珍拍了拍桌子以示强调。)</td></tr><tr><td>Almost but not quite, our invisible fuel carried to us by our inner senses could be likened to the air which you breathe, and which on a calm day is so difficult to perceive.</td><td>几乎但不完全是，我们的内在感官所携带的无形燃料，可以比作你呼吸的空气， 在平静的日子里，它是如此的难以察觉。</td></tr><tr><td>You cannot see a handful of air though your hands may be full of it.You know its effects, you breathe it constantly, but consciously you do not realize what you are doing.You do not know how air tastes unless you really think hard about it.It is fuel to your physical body and the idea of it comes very close to this fuel of the inner senses, which is not a camouflage effect and which is our vitality unsolidified, or the little wires which make up our imaginary universe.In other words these little wires move along constantly like little individual railway cars carrying fuel, and also are composed of the very fuel themselves.</td><td>尽管你满手都是空气，但你看不到这一把空气。你知道它的作用，你不断地呼吸 它，但在意识上你并没有意识到你在做什么。你不知道空气的味道，除非你真的 认真地想了想。它是你肉身形体的燃料，这个概念就非常接近内在感官的这种燃 料，它不是一种伪装的效果，而是非固化的生命力，或者说，是构成我们想象宇 宙的小丝线。换句话说，这些小丝线就像运载燃料的一个个小火车车厢一样，不 断地移动着，而丝线自身也是由这些燃料所组成。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you need a break?</td><td>你是否需要休息？</td></tr><tr><td>("No, Seth.")</td><td>("不，赛斯"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Using air again as a simple analogy to our fuel for the inner senses, which is converted by the various countries or planes for their own purposes and therefore camouflaged, air in its pure state is not observed easily.And permeating everything, it could almost pass unnoticed itself since it takes on the form of that which it composes.</td><td>再用空气来简单的比喻我们内在感官的燃料，它被各个国家或层面为了自己的目 的而转换，因此被伪装起来，纯净状态下的空气不容易被观察到。渗透到一切的 空气，几乎可以不被人注意到，因为它采取了它所构成的形式。</td></tr><tr><td>Surely you see where that leads us.If you will forgive me, my dear Joseph, you are full of air.I won't say hot air.But you look like a man.The man form, the physical form, is a camouflage that you see.You do not see the air of which you are composed when you look into a mirror.You are also composed of much water, yet you do not see a wet spongy mess when you look into the glass, at least I hope not.You see the camouflage or the physical form.</td><td>当然，你知道这将把我们引向何方。如果你能原谅我，我亲爱的约瑟，你充满了空气。我不是说你说大话[hot air] 。你看起来确实像个男人。有人的形态，身体的形态是你看到的伪装。当你照镜子时，你看不到组成你的空气。你还由大量的水组成，但从镜子里，你看不到湿漉漉的像海绵状的东西，至少我希望不会。你看到的是伪装，或者说，是物质形态。</td></tr><tr><td>I have added here the addition of water to air, yet they are composed of the same elements.The elements are the blocks which build our camouflage.Air and water have many forms even on your plane.The elements change position constantly to transform the inner vitality or fuel from one camouflage pattern to another.Then why is it so difficult to understand that this happens on other planes and under different camouflage sequences?</td><td>除了空气，我还加上了水来做说明，它们是由相同的元素组成。这些元素是构建 我们伪装的积木。空气和水即便在你们层面上也有多种形态。元素不断地改变位 置，将内在的生命力或燃料从一种伪装模式转换到另一种伪装模式。那为什么在 其他层面上和不同的伪装序列下，这种情况会如此难以理解呢？</td></tr><tr><td>Your scientists are correct in supposing that the universe is composed of the same elements that can be found on your plane.However, what they know as elements are of course particular camouflage patterns that may show

camouflages of the basic stuff or vitality, which you will not discover with your outer senses.Your scientists will discover that their tools are no longer adequate.Because man has such a sense of curiosity the scientists on your plane will be forced finally to use their own inner senses.Otherwise they will be dealing with camouflage only, and find themselves in a blind alley.Not because their eyes are closed, but because they are not using the right set of eyes.You will come no closer to knowledge of the fifth dimension until you use the inner senses as tools of perception.</td><td>同样，你们的元素，那些你们知道的和你们将发现的，以及你们将创造的元素， 都是你们不会用外在感官发现的基本东西或生命力的伪装。你们的科学家会发 现，他们的工具已经不够用了。因为人类有如此的好奇心，所以你们层面上的科 学家，最终会被迫使用自己的内在感官。否则，他们将只能与伪装打交道，发现 他们自己走在一条死胡同里。不是因为他们的眼睛闭着，而是因为他们没有正确 使用那双眼睛。在你们使用内在感官作为感知工具之前，你不会更接近第五维度 的知识。</td></tr><tr><td>The basic rules of the universe as I have said appear differently on different planes.The camouflage is necessary at this stage of development, intricate, complicated, various and beyond understanding of the outer senses which are the perceptron of camouflage itself, peculiarly adapted to see under particular circumstances.You cannot use camouflage to see through camouflage.There are basis rules in the universe.The inner senses use these rules consistently and well.</td><td>正如我说过的，宇宙的基本规则，在不同的层面有着不同表现。伪装在这个发展 阶段是必要的，错综复杂，五花八门，超出了外在感官的理解范围，而外在感官 本身就是伪装的感知器，特殊的适应于特定环境下的观察。你不能用伪装去看穿 伪装。宇宙中是有基本规则的。内在感官一贯地、并善于使用这些规则。</td></tr><tr><td>It is only the inner senses which will give you any evidence at all of the basic nature of life itself.Since very often the vitality or stuff of the universe seems as innocuous as air might seem to you, then look for what you do not see.Explore places that appear empty, for they are full. Look between events. What you see clearly with your outer senses is camouflage.I am not suggesting that you take everything on faith, nothing of the sort.I am saying that what seems vacant lacks camouflage, and therefore if this is explored it will yield evidence.I hope I have not carried you too far too fast.</td><td>只有内在感官才会给你提供任何关于生命本身基本性质的证据。既然很多时候， 宇宙的生命力或物质对你来说似乎就像空气一样无害，那么就去寻找你看不到的 东西。探索那些看似空无的地方，因为它们是充满东西的。在事件与事件之间寻 找(通过现象看本质)。你用外在感官可以清楚看见的东西都是伪装。我不是建议 你凡事都信，没有这样的意思。我是说，看似空无的往往没有伪装，因此，如果 对此进行探索，就会找到证据。我希望我没有把你带的太远太快。</td></tr><tr><td>Effects would seem to be evidence, and therefore when you probe into seemingly empty spaces you will receive effects which will be evidence.In concrete terms, if a tree branch blows you can take it for granted that something moves the branch.You know wind by its effects.No one has seen wind but since at times its effects are so observable it would be idiocy to say that wind did not exist.Therefore you will come up against the basic stuff of the universe and feel its effects, though your outer senses will not necessarily perceive it.</td><td>效果似乎是证据，因此，当你探讨看似空无一物的空间时，你将会收到会是证据 的效果。具体来说，如果一根树枝晃动，你理所当然地认为是什么东西移动了树 枝。就通过它的效应而知道是风。没有人见过风，但由于它的作用是如此显而易 见，说风不存在是愚蠢的。因此，你会碰到宇宙的基本东西，感受到它的影响， 虽然你的外在感官不一定能感知到它。</td></tr><tr><td>"Granted, your camouflage is in itself an effect.If you look at the observable physical world in this life, you can, it is true, learn something about the basic rules of the universe, if you take into consideration camouflage distortion.There is so much to be said here, and you have so much to learn that sometimes I have to admit that I'm appalled. "</td><td>诚然，你的伪装本身就是一种效果。如果你看看今生可观察到的物质世界，如果 你考虑到伪装扭曲，确实可以了解到一些宇宙的基本规则。这里要说的太多了， 有时我不得不承认，你有太多要学的东西，我很吃惊。</td></tr><tr><td>(I laughed.)</td><td>(我笑了。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your own experience with creativity should serve you well as far as this discussion goes.When you paint a picture, my dear egotistical Joseph, you are dealing with a transformation of energy and a transformation of camouflage pattern.There is a moment, a brief but vital moment in such an act of creation, when you are dealing with the underlying vitality of which I have spoken.You are forced because of your earthly physical situation to transform this creative energy into another camouflage pattern.There is nothing else you can do.But for this moment you pluck this vitality from the inner senses, you grab ahold of this fuel with both hands.You have it.You transform it into a somewhat different more evocative new camouflage pattern that is nevertheless more fluent, more fluid, than the usual pattern, and which gives greater freedom and mobility to the basic fuel or vitality itself.You approach a transmigration of planes.</td><td>你自己的创作经验应该对这个讨论很有帮助。当你划一幅画时，我亲爱的自负的 约瑟，你所面对的是一种能量的转换和伪装模式的转换。在这样的创作行为中， 有一个时刻，一个短暂但至关重要的时刻，你是在处理我所说的潜在的生命力。因为你现实的身体情况，你被迫将这种创造性的能量转化为另一种伪装模式。你 没有别的办法。但这一刻，你从内在的感觉中拔出这种生命力，你用双手抓住这 种燃料。你拥有了它。你把它转化为一种有些不同的，更令人回味的新的伪装模 式，尽管如此，它比通常的模式更流畅，更有流动性，它给了基本燃料或生命力 本身更大的自由和流动性。你在接近跨层面的嬗变。</td></tr><tr><td>A certain distortion must be expected, in the same manner that a distortion occurs in the form of your flying saucers.The painting in other words achieves a certain freedom from camouflage, while it cannot escape it, and actually hovers between planes in a way that no thoroughly camouflaged object could do.That is, something that exists completely in your plane cannot be evocative in the manner that a painting or, and this is for Ruburt, a poem can be.</td><td>某种程度的变形必然发生，就像你们的飞碟的形式发生变形一样。换句话说，画 作实现了某种摆脱伪装的自由，虽然无法逃脱伪装，它实际上是以任何彻底伪装 的物体都无法做到的方式在层面之间盘旋。也就是说，完全存在于你们层面中的 东西，无法像一幅画或者，这是对鲁伯说的，一首诗那样引人遐思。</td></tr><tr><td>Music, or rather a musical composition also achieves this state.Sculpture does not, for reasons that I will go into at a later time.The camouflage here however in the matter of a statue is too much like a prison.I am going to suggest a break.You may fly in as many pieces as you like at once.</td><td>音乐，或者说音乐作品也能达到这种状态。雕塑则不然，原因我以后再说。然而就雕塑这件事上，这里的伪装更像是个囚牢。我建议大家休息(break)一下。你可 以一次飞进多少片就飞进多少片 (break 有休息或打碎之意，赛斯喜欢玩双关语)。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:35.It was here that Jane, remarking about her fat hands, worked her ring back on.It took much pulling to get it off.She did not experience this odd sensation of change in any other part of her body.Resume dictation at 10:55. )</td><td>(10:35 休息。就在这时，珍谈起她发胖的手，把戒指勉强戴上了。之前花了好大力气才把它摘下来。她身体的其他部位并没有经历这种变化的古怪感觉。10:55 继续传述</td></tr><tr><td>Your scientists can count their elements.While they are on the wrong track they will discover more and more elements. That is, they will create more and discover more until they are ready to go out of their minds.Because what will happen is, they will always create camouflages of the real thing.And while they create instruments to deal with smaller and smaller particular particles, they will actually see smaller and smaller particles, seemingly without end.</td><td>你们的科学家们可以数得过来他们的元素。然而，只要他们仍在错误的轨道上， 他们就会发现越来越多的元素，直到发疯为止。因为将要发生的是，他们总是在 创造着真实东西的伪装。随着他们用创造的仪器，处理越来越小的特定粒子时， 他们真的会看到越来越小的粒子，似乎没有尽头。</td></tr><tr><td>As their instruments reach further into the universe they will "see," and I suggest that you put the word see into quotes, they will "see" further and further but they will automatically subconsciously transform what they apparently see into the camouflage pattern with which they are familiar.</td><td>当他们的仪器深入宇宙时，他们会"看到"我建议你把"看到"这个词打上引 号，他们会"看到"越来越远，但他们会自动下意识地把他们明显看到的东西转 变成他们熟悉的伪装模式。</td></tr><tr><td>They will be and they are prisoners of their own tools.More galaxies will seemingly be discovered, more mysterious radio stars will be perceived, until the scientists realize that something is desperately wrong.Instruments designed to measure the vibrations with which

certain camouflages and since they are expertly thought out they will perform their function.</td><td>他们会是，他们就是自己工具的俘虏。更多的星系似乎会被发现，更多神秘的射 电星会被看到，直到科学家们意识到有什么东西极度不对劲。所要设计的、旨在

deeply, as there is much more to be said on a technical level.But when you decipher one phenomena in terms of another you always lose sight of whatever glimmer of understanding may have reached you.</td><td>仪器本身就在做这种转换，把比如说时间或者光年的概念转换为声波、无线电波 等等。在这个过程中，你已失去了太多的东西。你得到的是如此扭曲，以至于你 们完全不知那原始面貌。我将更深入地探讨这个问题，因为在技术层面上还有很 多要说。但是，当你用一种现象来解读另一种现象时，你总是会忽略掉那可能触 及你的一丝照见。</td></tr><tr><td>It is not a matter of inventing new instruments any longer.It is a matter of using the invisible instruments that you have.These instruments may be known and even examined by their effects.This material itself is

I also like the hairdo.  She is doing very well with the cigarette habit, as I predicted that she would.</td><td>看到珍穿上裙子，这不是很好吗？我也喜欢这个发型。她的烟瘾改得很好，正如 我所预料的那样。</td></tr><tr><td>Mental enzymes belong to the mind rather than the brain, although they function through both and use chemical properties of the physical body in their operation.</td><td>精神酵素属于心智而不是头脑，尽管它们通过两者发挥作用，并利用肉身形体的 化学特性进行操作。</td></tr><tr><td>It is extremely difficult to go into detail concerning the inner senses, simply because they are un-camouflaged.I do hope to go into detail however, now or later.In some respects the inner senses can be compared to channels on your plane. When continuity is taken into consideration however then the analogy is a poor one, since the word channel seems to imply a more or less permanent opening, and this is not true. One of the marvels of your outer senses is their reach.They actually carry you further ahead, in distance for example, than your physical body may be at any particular time.</td><td>因为内在感官并非伪装，仔细地讲解它们是非常困难的。我的确想要现在或以后 进行仔细讲解。在某些方面，内在感官可以被比作你们层面上的通道。然而，当 考虑到连续性时，那么这个比喻就不恰当了，因为通道这个词，似乎意味着一个 或多或少是永久的开放，而这是不正确的。你的外在感官的一个奇妙之处在于它们的覆盖范围。比如说在距离上，它们可以在任何特定的时间，把你带到实际上 比你肉体能够的，还要更远的地方 。</td></tr><tr><td>The sense of sight, mostly concentrated in your eyes, remains fixed in a permanent position on your physical body.This is of course true.Without moving away from the physical body the eyes see something that may be far in the distance.In the same manner the ears hear sounds that are distant from the body.In fact, and this is a rather important point, the ears ordinarily hear sounds outside the body more readily than sounds inside the body itself.Since the ears are in the body more or less, and of it, it would be logical for an open- minded observer to suppose that the ears would be well attuned to the inner sounds to a high degree.This as you know is not the case.</td><td>视觉，大多集中在你的眼睛里，在你的肉体上保持着一个永久的位置。这当然是 正确的。不用离开肉体，眼睛就能看到远处。同样，耳朵也能听到离身体很远的 声音。事实上，这是相当重要的一点，耳朵通常听到身体外的声音，比自身内部 的声音更容易。由于耳朵多少是在身体内或与之相连，这对一个思想开放的观察 者来说，认为耳朵会很高程度对准内在声音将是合乎逻辑的。你也知道，事实并 非如此。</td></tr><tr><td>Your eyes, while belonging to the body, cannot see within the body.The ears can be trained to some degree by neurotic individuals into a sound awareness pertaining to the body itself.Breathing for example can be magnified to an almost frightening degree when one concentrates upon listening to his own breath.But as a rule the ears neither listen to nor hear the inner sounds of the body.</td><td>你的眼睛，虽属于身体，却看不到身体内部。耳朵可以在一定程度上被神经过敏 者训练成，能觉察身体自身的声音。例如，当一个人专注于倾听自己的呼吸时， 气息可以被放大到几乎可怕的程度。但通常情况下，耳朵既不聆听，也听不到身 体内部的声音。</td></tr><tr><td>The sense of smell also seems to leap forward.A man can smell quite a stink, even though it is not right under his nose.The sense of touch, as you are consciously familiar with it, does not seem to leap out in this manner.Unless the hand itself presses upon a surface in some manner then you do not feel that you have touched it.Touch usually involves contact of a direct sort.You can of course feel the invisible wind against your cheek, but touch involves an immediacy different from the distant perceptions of sight and smell.</td><td>嗅觉似乎也能向前跃进。一个人可以闻到相当的臭味，即使不在他的鼻子正下 方。触觉，如你意识上所熟悉的，似乎并不以这种方式跃出。除非手本身以某种 方式压在一个表面上，否则你不觉得触摸到了它。触摸通常涉及到直接的接触。你当然可以感觉到无形的风吹拂着你的脸颊，但触摸涉及的直接性，不同于可远 距离感受的视觉和嗅觉。</td></tr><tr><td>I am sure that you realize these points yourself.I do after all, and regardless of what you may think, credit you both with a certain sense of intelligence and imagination.</td><td>我确信你们自己也明白这些观点。我毕竟是这样做的，不管你们怎么想，我都认 为你们俩都有一定的智力和想象力。</td></tr><tr><td>This difference in immediacy is rather important for our consideration of the inner senses.This is also why I mentioned that the ears and the eyes, while connected with the body, are directed outward.They bring data to the body but very seldom do they collect data from the body.I am beginning to get into some material that is relatively difficult to explain, considering that I must take all of your camouflage patterns into consideration.</td><td>这种直接性的差异，对于我们考虑内在感官是相当重要的。这也是为什么我提 到，耳朵和眼睛虽然与身体相连，但却是向外的。它们给身体带来资料，但很少 从身体内收集资讯。我开始进入一些相对难以解释的资料，因为我必须要把你们 所有的伪装模式都列入考虑。</td></tr><tr><td>As I have said, the outer senses deal mainly and as far as I know exclusively with camouflage pattern.The inner senses, my dear Joseph, are senses which deal with realities beneath camouflage patterns, and which carry data of these realities, these inner realities, to the body.These inner senses therefore are thoroughly capable of seeing the inside of the body, in a way that the outer eyes cannot.</td><td>正如我所说，外在感官主要是处理，而且就我所知，专门处理伪装模式。我亲爱 的约瑟，内在感官是处理伪装模式之下的实相，并把这些内在实相的资讯带到身 体的感官。因此，这些内在感官能够彻底地看到身体的内部，这是外部眼睛所不 能看到的。</td></tr><tr><td>As the outer senses of sight, sound and smell appear to reach outward, bringing data to the physical body from an outside observable camouflage pattern, so the inside senses seem to extend far inward, bringing important inner reality data to the physical body.There is also a transforming process here much like the moment that we have spoken of in the creation of a painting.</td><td>如同外在的视觉、听觉、嗅觉似乎向外延伸，从外在可观察的伪装模式中给身体 带来资料一样，内在感官似乎也向内远远延伸，为身体带来重要的内在实相资料。这里也有一个转化的过程，很像我们讲过的绘画创作的那一刻。</td></tr><tr><td>The physical body is a camouflage pattern operating in a larger camouflage pattern.But the physical body and all camouflage patterns, looked at in another manner, are also transformers of the vital inner stuff of the universe, where this vitality is then enabled to operate under new and various conditions.</td><td>肉身形体是一个伪装模式，在一个更大的伪装模式中运作。但是，从另一个角度 看，肉体和所有的伪装模式，也是宇宙中有生命力的内在物质转化器，在那里， 这种生命力，然后能够在新的、不同的条件下运作。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take a short break, while I consider the most auspicious manner in which to go ahead with this material.I have been ready to speak further on the inner senses for some time now.Go ahead, take your break.</td><td>我建议短暂休息，我趁此好好想想，怎样以最尽善尽美的方式来继续谈这份资 料。我准备好进一步谈内在感官，已经有一阵子了。去吧，休息一下吧。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:31.Jane said she felt Seth wanted this material to be very clear to us, and so was proceeding step by step.He was, she said, having a hard time presenting it.Indeed, Jane delivered this material with many pauses.Since we had dispensed with taking messages through the board in the main, this session was the slowest-paced one to date.Jane resumed dictating at 9:36.)</td><td>(9:31 休息。珍说，她觉得赛斯想让我们非常清楚地了解这些资料，所以在一步步地进行。她说，他很难介绍。的确，珍传递这个资料时，有许多停顿。由于我 们基本上已不再用显灵板接收信息，所以这节课是迄今为止节奏最慢的一次。珍 在 9:36 恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>The inner senses deliver data from the inner world of reality to the body.The outer senses deliver data from the outside world of camouflage to the body.</td><td>内在感官将实相的内在世界资讯传递给身体。外在感官将伪装的外部世界资讯传 递给身体。</td></tr><tr><td>However, the inner senses are aware of the body's own physical data at all times, while the outer senses are concerned with the body mainly in its relationship to camouflage environment.In other words the inner senses have an immediate, constant knowledge of the body in a way that the outer senses do not.</td><td>但是，内在感官时刻关注着身体自身的身体资讯，而外在感官关注的主要是身体 与伪装环境的关系。换句话说，内在感官对身体有直接的、持续的了解，而外在 感官则没有。</td></tr><tr><td>The material is delivered to the body, as I have said, from the inner world by means of these inner senses.This inner reality data is received by the mind.This is extremely important.The mind, being un-camouflaged, is the receiving station for the data brought to it by the inner senses.What you almost have here is an inner nervous and communication system closely resembling the outer systems with which you are familiar.</td><td>正如我所说，资料是通过这些内在感官从内在世界传递给身体的。这种内在实相 的资料是由心智来接收的。这一点极为重要。心智，是不加掩饰的，是内在感官 所带来资讯的接收站。你几乎在这里拥有一个内在的神经和通讯系统，与你所熟 悉的外在系统非常相似。</td></tr><tr><td>I risk repeating myself, but I want these steps to be plain.This vital data is sent to the mind by the inner senses.Any material that is important for the body's contact with outer camouflage patterns is given to the brain.The subconscious, so-called, is a connective between mind and brain, between the inner senses and the outer senses.It is actually partly on your plane and partly on other planes.Portions of it do deal with camouflage patterns, with the personal past of the present personality, with racial camouflage memories; and the greater portion belongs to the inner world, and as data comes into it from the inner world, so can it reach far into the inner world itself.</td><td>我冒着重复自己的风险，但我希望这些步骤清楚明了。这个至关重要的资料是由 内在的感官传到心智的。任何对身体与外界伪装模式接触的重要资料，都会交给 头脑。所谓的潜意识，是心智和头脑之间，内在感官和外在感官之间的连接物。它其实一部分在你们的层面上，一部分在其他层面上。它的一部分确实是处理伪 装模式，处理当前人格的过去，处理种族的伪装记忆；而更大的一部分则属于内 在世界，如同资讯从内在世界进入潜意识，潜意识也可以深入内在世界。</td></tr><tr><td>You must remember here that time is part of the camouflage pattern.Now the outer sense of sight would seem to confound space, and seemingly conquer a portion of distance by using your eyes.That is, you do not necessarily have to walk a short distance in order to see what is in the particular space involved.</td><td>这里你必须记住，时间是伪装模式的一部分。视觉的外在感知仿佛混淆了空间， 似乎用眼睛就可以征服一部分距离。也就是说，你不一定要走一小段距离，才能 看到所涉及的特定空间里的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>So the inner senses and the subconscious can do the same thing as far as inner space, and what you would call inner time, is concerned.But this is not amazing, far from it.It only seems strange because you are so familiar with your precious camouflage patterns.Time and space, dear friends, are both camouflage patterns, therefore the fact that the inner senses can conquer time and space is not, after all, so surprising.To the mind with its subconscious, and to the inner senses, there is no time and space, and therefore to them nothing is conquered.The camouflage is simply not present.</td><td>所以，就内在空间，以及你们所说的内在时间而言，内在感官和潜意识可以做同 样的事情。但这并不惊人，远非如此。只是因为你们对自己宝贝的伪装模式太熟 悉，才显得奇怪。亲爱的朋友们，时间和空间，都是伪装模式，因此，内在感官 能够克服时空的事实，毕竟没什么好令人惊讶的。对于具有潜意识的心智，以及 内在感官来说，没有时间和空间，因此对它们来说，没有什么要被征服的。伪装 根本不存在。</td></tr><tr><td>When I speak of the subconscious in this manner, I speak of course of that larger portion which deals with the inner realities.I want to give you more detailed information about the inner realities themselves.Actually they do not parallel the outer senses, and this will sound appalling to you I'm afraid, simply because there is nothing to be seen, smelled, heard or touched in the manner in which you are accustomed.This is extremely hard to explain, since I do not want to give you the idea that existence without your particular set of camouflage patterns is bland and innocuous, because this is not the case.</td><td>当我这样说到潜意识的时候，我说的当然是那个更大的部分，它涉及到内在的实 相。我想给你更详细地介绍一下内在实相本身。其实它们并不与外在的感官平 行，这在你们听来恐怕会觉得骇人听闻，只因为没有任何东西可以用你们习惯的 方式去看、去闻、去听、去摸。这一点是极难解释的，因为我不想给你们一个想 法，认为没有你们那一套特定的伪装模式的存在，就是平淡无奇的，因为事实并 非如此。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner senses have a strong immediacy, a delicious intensity that your outer senses lack.There is no lapse of time in perception, since there is no time.</td><td>内在感官有一种强烈的直接性，一股有味儿的劲道，是你们的外在感官所缺乏 的。由于没有时间，所以在感受上也就没有了时间的流逝。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest again a short period of refreshment.You are both doing well.</td><td>我再次建议短暂的充电。你们俩都做得很好。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:01.Once again Jane remarked upon the fact that Seth was being very deliberate in giving us this material.Resume at 10:04. )</td><td>(10:01 休息。珍再次说，赛斯给我们这些资料是非常慎重的。10:04 恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>I am deliberately being deliberate.And for the present I am using Ruburt's voice, making no effort to superimpose my own.And for good reason.I do not want this material to be considered any sort of mumbo jumbo.It is not a cult in the terms that people often consider material that seems to come from a source beyond the individual who gives it.</td><td>我是刻意地深思熟虑的。目前我使用的是鲁伯的声音，没有努力叠加自己的声音。这是有原因的。我不希望这些资料被认为是什么胡言乱语。这不是一个邪 教，就这术语来说，人们经常认为，给出这些资料的，似乎来自于一个超越个人 的来源。</td></tr><tr><td>"The designations spirit, and medium and so forth, are ridiculous to begin with.You are simply using inner senses.These senses are not magical, they certainly are not religious in any sense of the word, and I am not some degenerating secondary personality of Ruburt's.Nor will I be compared with some long- bearded, beady-eyed spirit sitting on cloud nine. "</td><td>那些有名称的灵[Spirit]、灵媒等，本来就是荒谬可笑的。你只是在使用内在感 官。这些感官并不神奇，当然也不是任何意义上的宗教，我也不是鲁伯退化的次 要人格。也不能把我比作那留着长须、目光闪烁、坐在九霄云上的灵。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true that I have lived as a human being, but this is simply a fact.This meeting and our other meetings are not seances, and your experiments with your friend Mark are not seances, according to the implications usually given.So-called seances, when they are legitimate, are simply exercises in the use of the inner senses.</td><td>我的确以人类的形式活过，但这只是一个事实。本节课和我们其他的课都不是降 神会，你和你的朋友马克的实验，也不是通常给定含义的降神会。所谓的降神会，当他们确有其事时，也只是内在感官的运用练习。</td></tr><tr><td>The cults that have built up around such happenings are ludicrous, and in some cases unforgivable demonstrations of stupidity by well-meaning but imbecilic personalities.I dislike being so harsh and vindictive.However on a few occasions I have been involved, to my utter horror, on the other end of such performances.At a later date I will tell you about this.It is not important but it was distasteful.</td><td>围绕这样的事件建立起来的教派是荒唐的，在某些情况下是不可饶恕的愚蠢表 现，是善意但却是低能人格的糊涂事。我不喜欢如此苛刻，睚眦必报。然而，有 几次我也参与了这样的表演，令我极度厌恶。日后，我会告诉你这件事。这事并 不重要，但令人反感。</td></tr><tr><td>"Superstition breeds superstition.As far as Jane's or Ruburt's subconscious is concerned, I make contact with you through both of your subconsciousness (Jane's pronunciation); but through that larger portion which actually exists between planes, which is the property of the mind, not the brain, and which deals with the inner senses.I have absolutely nothing to do with that portion of the subconscious which is involved with your personal memories or present personality makeup."</td><td>迷信会滋生迷信。就珍或鲁伯的潜意识而言，我是通过你们两个的潜意识(珍的 发音)与你们接触的；不过是透过潜意识那较大的那个部分，它实际上存在于层 面之间，它是心智而不是头脑的属性，并且这部分涉及到内在感官。我与涉及你 们个人记忆或组成当前人格的那部分潜意识，没有任何关系。</td></tr><tr><td>I have more or less avoided giving you the kind of so-called evidence that would be so handy in explaining me to others.I helped you one night to keep your interest high.This occurred during the beginning of our sessions.I am also a personality in myself.I am not going to run around in circles, perform tricks, move rings, throw rocks and so forth.This material is legitimate, speaks for itself, and I will not embellish an otherwise sensible and excellent performance with circus tactics to impress those who will not be impressed under any circumstances.</td><td>我或多或少地避免给你们提供那种所谓的证据，这些证据在向别人解释我的时候 会很方便。有一天晚上，我帮助你让你保持高度的兴趣。这发生在我们课程开始 的时候。我也是一个有个性的人。我不会绕着圈子跑，表演魔术，移动戒指，扔 石头等等。这些资料都是有凭有据，不证自明的，我不会用马戏团的手段来美化 一个原本合理而优秀的表现，来打动那些在任何情况下都无动于衷的人。</td></tr><tr><td>At times I may use my own voice simply because it will be easier to get some kinds of material across, and also because it just would be fun for a change.You said something, Joseph, that got me on this subject.I had intended to go into the inner senses more thoroughly.However this reminds me of something else.</td><td>有时我可能会用自己的声音，只是因为这样会更容易把一些资料表达出来，也因 为改变一下会很有趣。你说的一些话，约瑟，让我扯到了这个话题。我本来打算 更彻底地探讨内在感官。然而这让我想起了另一件事。</td></tr><tr><td>You asked me, or you meant to ask me, why this material was being given to you, that is to you and Ruburt.My answer is, beside my strong affection for you both, that you are unaffiliated with any cult, religion, particular school of thought.You are open-minded, and I speak of both of you; not fools, and not ready to cast me in the guise of potbellied Cupid, Buddha, god, saint or devil.Such people are difficult to find.</td><td>你问我，或者你是想问我，为什么要把这些资料给你，也就是给你和鲁伯。我的 回答是，除了我对你们俩的浓厚感情外，你们与任何教派、宗教、特定的思想流 派都没有关系。你们思想开放，我说的就是你们两个；不是傻瓜，也不准备把我 假扮成大腹便便的丘比特、佛、神、圣人或魔鬼。这样的人很难找。</td></tr><tr><td>Camouflage patterns are bad enough to deal with from my end, but personal camouflage patterns thrown up by the brain are worse.As far as your neurotics are concernedâfor some reason speaking of the affairs usually called seances reminded me of neuroticsâas far as neurotics are concerned, this neuroticism is part and parcel of an inadequacy on the part of the physical body and the personality both, that involves an inability to handle camouflage patterns.</td><td>伪装模式从我这一端来说已经很不好对付了，但头脑抛出的个人伪装模式更糟糕。至于你们的精神病患者—不知为什么，通常称为降神会的事情提醒了我，精神病患者这个词—精神病患而言，这种神经质是肉体和人格两方面不足的重要组成部分，这涉及到没有能力处理伪装模式。</td></tr><tr><td>A neurotic on your plane for example would not necessarily be a neurotic on another plane, though he might be.The subconscious has been blamed for too much.Terms sometimes cause more troubles in communication than they solve.</td><td>你们层面的精神病，在另一个层面就未必是精神病，虽然也可能是。潜意识被怪 罪得过头了。在沟通上，专门术语造成的麻烦比解决的问题还多。</td></tr><tr><td>The conscious mind deals directly with survival as far as the particular camouflage patterns are concerned.But there is no actual dividing line or distinction between the conscious and the subconscious, nor among the apparent levels of the subconscious itself.</td><td>就特定的伪装模式而言，有意识的心智直接处理的是生存问题。但意识和潜意识 之间并没有实际的分界线或区别，潜意识本身也不存在明显的级别层次。</td></tr><tr><td>I want you to take a break but first I want to make one other point, and that is this: The mind contains the conscious and the subconscious, but the conscious and the subconscious are fluid.At various times the consciousness becomes unconscious, and the unconscious becomes conscious.During some periods this happens simultaneously.I will go into this in great detail.</td><td>我想让你们休息一下，但首先我还想说明一点，那就是：心智包含意识和潜意 识，但意识和潜意识是流动的。在不同时期，意识变成无意识，无意识变成意 识。在某些时期，这种情况是同时发生的。我将对此进行详细的论述。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:32.Try as we would, Jane and I could not recall what I had said at last break to bring on Seth's outburst concerning mediums, etc.  We think it was at least an innocently intended remark, one made in passing.I now remarked that I wondered whether Seth even wanted us to publish this material, since this might also be regarded by him as using him.Jane said that she definitely did not think he meant that.She resumed dictating at 10:40.)</td><td>(10:32 休息。珍和我都想不起来上次休息时我说了什么，引发赛斯对有关灵媒之类的事大发雷霆。我们认为这至少是话里有话、顺便一提。现在我说，我想知道赛斯是否真的想让我们发表这些资料，因为这也可能被他认为是在利用他。珍 说，她绝对不认为他是这个意思。她在 10:40 继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>I have said that the brain is the mind in camouflage, and so it is.It is the portion of the mind that is more or less observable to the surgeon, and the part of the mind that reacts to camouflage pattern, and the part that can be explored and tampered with, though this is dangerous indeed.</td><td>我曾说过，头脑是伪装的心智，事实也是如此。它是外科医生或多或少可以观察 到的部分，也是对伪装模式有反应的部分，也是可以探索和篡改的部分，不过这 样确实很危险。</td></tr><tr><td>The camouflage patterns of course do belong to the inner world also, since the camouflages themselves are formed from the vitality stuff of the universe by mental enzymes, which have a chemical reaction on your plane.The reaction of course being a distortion.That is, any camouflage pattern at all is bound to be a distortion, in a sense, of vitality forced into a particular form.</td><td>伪装模式当然也属于内在世界，因为伪装模式本身就是由宇宙有生命力之物通过 精神酵素形成的，精神酵素在你们的层面会发生化学反应。当然这个反应会是一 种扭曲。也就是说，任何伪装模式注定会是一种扭曲，在某种意义上说，是生命 力强行转化为某种特定形式的扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>As far as publishing this material is concerned, I have no objections.I didn't give it to you, and I'm not giving it to you, simply for your own edification.Because of its source you will probably be called crackpots, but I imagine you know this by now.</td><td>至于发表这份资料，我不反对。我给了你们，也正在给你们这些资料，不是只为 了让你们自己得到启发。因为它的来源，你们可能会被称为疯子，但我想你们现 在已经知道了。</td></tr><tr><td>Mental enzymes are actually the property of the inner world, representing the conversion of vitality into camouflage data which is then interpreted by the outer senses.Before I continue do you have any questions on this material?</td><td>精神酵素其实是内在世界的属性，代表着生命力转为伪装资料的转换，再由外在

analogy.Though in some cases it may fall down, overall it will make my point.</td><td>我想打一个比方。虽然在某些例子可能会落空，但总的来说，能说明我的观点。</td></tr><tr><td>Imagine a man standing on a corner, looking down the street at a tree a block away.He need not walk that distance in order to know what is there since he can see everything between himself and the tree, at least as far as large objects are concerned.His sense of sight allows him this freedom.</td><td>想象一下，一个人站在街角，看着一个街区外的一棵树。他不需要走那么远的距 离就能知道那里有什么，因为他可以看到自己和树之间的一切，至少就大型物体 而言是这样。他的视觉感知让他拥有这种自由。</td></tr><tr><td>Imagine a man in an automobile who passes our man at the corner.Now when our man in the automobile reaches the tree he is further ahead, so to speak, in distance.He is also in some respects further ahead in time, yet actually he is not.That is, the man on the corner has watched him pass by.He is beyond the man on the corner in space. The man on the corner at the same time sees the motorist drive beyond.But although he sees him pass in space he knows that they exist, he and the motorist, simultaneously even though usually the idea of passing on involves time.</td><td>想象一下，一个开着汽车的人经过站在街角的人。现在，开车的人到达那棵树 时，可以说，在距离上，他更向前了。在某些方面，在时间上也更超前了，但实 际上他并没有。也就是说，站在街角的人看到他经过。他在空间上超越了街角的 人。街角的人同时也看到了驾车者驶过。尽管他看到驾车者在空间上经过，但他 知道，他和驾车者，他们是同时存在。虽然擦肩而过这个概念，通常涉及时间。</td></tr><tr><td>If you will imagine the rather odd picture of a solid beam extending from the body of the man on the corner to the tree, then this may help you to think of sight as a path.This particular path exists in space for man A, who is at the corner.If man A hears the screech of brakes there is an interval of time existing between the sound and his awareness of it.Consider this as another solid beam or path.</td><td>如果你想象一个相当奇特的画面，即一条坚实的光束，从站在街角的人的身体， 延伸到树那里，那么这可帮助你，把视线看作是一条路径。这条特殊的路径存在于空间中，对于站于街角处的人 A 来说。如果 A 听到尖锐的刹车声，在声音和他对声音的觉知之间，有一个时间间隔存在。把这看作是另一条坚实的光束或路 径。</td></tr><tr><td>The reason I am using solidity here is that we are dealing with the world of camouflage, and sound waves and light waves are definite on your plane and can be measured.They are not solid as your tree is solid, but they are solid in degree.That is, they manifest themselves well enough to be recorded on your instruments.</td><td>我在这里使用坚固性的原因是，我们正与伪装的世界打交道，声波和光波在你的 层面上是确定的，可以测量。它们并不像树那样坚实，但它们在一定程度上是坚 实的。也就是说，它们显化自己到足以被记录在你们的仪器上。</td></tr><tr><td>Now with that out of the way, we can consider the inner senses as paths leading to an inner reality.However, here we are not concerned with space or time.If you were, or if man A was blind, he would not see the tree in question.If he were deaf he would not hear the car.Let us pretend this state of events, and let us compare the physical objects between our man and his tree to points somewhat corresponding to them in the inner world.It would be as if instead of seeing the various houses or whatever, our man instead felt them.If you remember, I mentioned earlier that your outer sense of touch was extremely immediate, in a way that sight was not, and I also gave you immediacy as one of the qualities of the inner senses.</td><td>现在把这件事说清楚后，我们可以把内在的感官视为通往内在实相的路径。然 而，在这里我们并不关心空间或时间。如果你是，或者如果 A 是盲人，他就不会看到所提到的树。如果他是聋子，他就听不到汽车的声音。让我们假设这种事 态，我们把这个人和树之间的实物，与内心世界中与它们有些对应的点，进行比较。这就好比我们的人，没有看到各种房子或什么东西，而是感觉到了它们。如果你还记得，我在前面提到过，你外在感官的触觉是极其直接性的，在某种程度上，视觉是没有的，我也说了，直接性是内在感官的特质之一。</td></tr><tr><td>Now our man would not vaguely sense these objects, he would feel them.He would be sensitive to them, in other words, while not touching them with anything like physical hands, as for example you feel heat or cold without necessarily touching ice or fire.</td><td>现在我们的人不会是隐约地感知到这些物体，而是感觉到它们。换句话说，虽然 没有用任何像手之类的去碰触它们，他也会对它们敏感，这就像，你不用碰触冰 和火，也可以感受到冷或热一样。</td></tr><tr><td>This is one of the qualities belonging to the inner senses.I will go into it more deeply but you may call it the first inner sense.</td><td>这是属于内在感官的特质之一。我将更深入地探讨它，但你可以称它为第一内在 感官。</td></tr><tr><td>It involves immediate perception of a direct nature, whose intensity varies according to what is being sensed.It involves instant cognition through what I can only describe as inner vibrational touch.This is, if you will excuse the pun, touchy, since I want to avoid any implication here of sloppy sentimental emotionalism; and the word vibrational is not the best.</td><td>它涉及到一种直接性质的当下感知，其强度根据被感知的对象而变化。它涉及 到，我只能描述为内在振动触觉的立即认知。如果你原谅我用双关语，就是震动的敏感[touchy，敏感，触动，译者]，因为我这里想避免任何草率、感性、情绪化的含义；振动也不是最好的词。</td></tr><tr><td>This sense would permit our man to feel the basic sensations felt by the tree, so that instead of looking at the tree his consciousness would expand to contain the experience of what it is like to be a tree.According to his proficiency, in a like manner he would feel the experience of being the intervening grass and so forth.</td><td>这个感官，将使我们的人能够感觉到树所感觉到的基本感受，这样，他就不是只 看着树，而是意识扩大到包含作为一棵树的体验。根据他的熟练程度，以类似的 方式，他会感觉到作为茵茵芳草的经验，依此类推。</td></tr><tr><td>He would in no way lose consciousness of who he was, and he would perceive these experiences, again, somewhat in the same manner that you perceive heat and cold.In your camouflage pattern you must adapt yourself to the effects of heat and cold, but our man in the inner world would not be under any such obligation.I am speaking now only of our first inner sense.</td><td>他绝对不会失去对自己是谁的意识，他对这些经验的感知，又有点像你对热和冷 的感知一样。在你的伪装模式中，你必须使自己适应热和冷的影响，但在内在世 界，则无需承担这样的约束。我现在说的只是我们的第一内在感官。</td></tr><tr><td>If you two are not too tired to continue the session for a short time, then rest for a moment and continue.I will not take the responsibility from you for keeping you from rosy night dreams.So when you are ready to end the session simply say so.</td><td>如果你们两个，不是累得不能再继续一会儿的话，那么我们就休息一下，然后继 续。我不想承担让你们做不了绮丽美梦的责任。所以，当你准备好了要结束课程 时，只管说。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:22.Resume at 11:28.)</td><td>(11:22。在 11:28 继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am not going to keep you too long this evening in any case.However I do want to mention the fact that the inner senses are capable of expansion and of focus in a way that the outer senses are not.They simply extend further, though I am speaking now in your terms rather than my own.And as to where the inner world actually is on your plane, I will go into that at our next session.</td><td>今晚无论如何，我都不会耽误你太久。然而，我确实想说一个事实，即内在感官 能够以一种外在感官无法做到的方式扩展和聚焦。它们就是能延伸得更远，我现 在用的是你们的术语而不是我的。至于在你们层面上，内在世界究竟在哪里，我 在下一节课会谈到。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner world of course is part of all planes.It is not so much that it exists simultaneously with the outer world, as that it forms the outer world and the outer world exists in it.</td><td>内在世界当然是所有层面的一部分。并不是说它与外在世界同时存在，而是说它 形成了外在世界，外在世界存在于它之中。</td></tr><tr><td>When you receive more material on the inner senses, you can begin using them to a much higher degree than you do now.For those interested in inner reality the inner senses can be utilized, of course, to explore and perceive portions of this inner reality; and the inner reality is after all what you are after.</td><td>当你收到更多关于内在感官的资料时，你就可以开始以比现在更高的程度使用它 们。对于那些对内在实相感兴趣的人来说，当然可以利用内在感官来探索和感受 部分的内在实相；内在实相毕竟是你们在追求的。</td></tr><tr><td>I will have to go into what we will call for now evolution at some time to explain the influence of the inner world upon the outer world, because the species to which you have the honor of belonging is now moving in the direction of breakthrough discoveries, as far as inner reality is concerned.There is much more to be said here, and you can count on me to say it.</td><td>在某个时间，我非得谈一谈我们现在所称为的演化，以解释内在世界对外部世界 的影响，因为就内在实相而言，你们有幸所属的物种，现在正朝着突破性发现的 方向发展。这里还有很多要说，你们可以拭目以待。</td></tr><tr><td>I have spoken more slowly than usual because I want this material to be taken down carefully, with a minimum of distortion.And now my peachy friends I will leave you with this plum of excellent material, though as usual I dislike saying good-bye.And even to me your next Monday seems a long way off.</td><td>我讲得比平时慢很多，因为我希望这些资料能小心翼翼地记下来，尽量减少失 真。现在，我超棒的好朋友，我将留给你们这份超棒的资料，虽然和往常一样， 我不喜欢说再见。甚至对我来说，你们的下周一似乎还很遥远。</td></tr><tr><td>(At the board, we said good night as usual.</td><td>(在显灵板旁，我们像往常一样说晚安。)</td></tr><tr><td>(Gratis)</td><td>(自动回答)</td></tr><tr><td>A most warm good evening.</td><td>一个最温暖的美好夜晚。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 11:40.Jane said that Seth felt very chummy by the end of the session, and would have gladly continued had we asked him to.We were in the mood but also very tired.</td><td>(11 点 40 分结束。珍说，赛斯在课程结束时感觉很亲切，如果我们要求他继续， 他也会很乐意。我们很有兴致，但也很累。</td></tr><tr><td>(It might be worth noting that during this session we did not have our window shades pulled as we used to do.Also, Jane's eyes did not appear to be as dark as usual.)</td><td>(可能值得一提的是，在本节课期间，我们没有像平常那样拉上窗帘。另外，珍的 眼睛似乎也没有平时那么黑了。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 21</td><td>第 21 节 生命解读,债要偿</td></tr><tr><td>FEBRUARY 3, 1964 9 PM MONDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964 年 2 月 3 日 晚上 9 点 星期一 按指示</td></tr><tr><td>(Saturday Feb.  1, while doing some other art work, I had a vision. This was of my present younger brother Dick during his life in England in 1671.I saw very clearly the font upstairs bedroom in which he slept, and the bed in which he died as a boy of 9.I made a very quick sketch of this mental picture with a ballpoint pen.Jane and I both liked it, so I matted it.When this session began I had the drawing propped up on the bookcase so Jane could see it easily as she paced back and forth.</td><td>(2 月 1 日星期六，当我在做其他艺术创作时，我有了一个灵视，这是我这一世的弟弟迪克，1671 年在英国的生活。我很清楚地看到他楼上的卧室，以及他 9 岁去世时躺的那张床。我把这心中的画面，用圆珠笔快速地做了一个速写。我和珍 都很喜欢，所以我装裱了一下。课程开始时，我把这幅画放在书架上，这样珍在 来回踱步时就能很容易地看到它。</td></tr><tr><td>(At the start of the session our cat Willy became very frisky.As we sat at the board preparatory to greeting Seth, Willy jumped up on it; from there he vaulted up on the bookcase, knocking the sketch to the floor.As I retrieved it Jane began to receive Seth within.After Seth spelled out his greeting, Jane rose and began to dictate.She exhibited no voice or hand phenomena this evening merely the darkening of the eyes.</td><td>(课程开始时，我们的猫咪威利变得非常活泼。当我们坐在显灵版前准备迎接赛 斯时，威利跳到了显灵板上，牠从那里躬身跃上书架，把这幅素描碰掉在地板 上。当我拾起这幅画时，珍开始从内部接收到赛斯。赛斯拼出他的问候后，珍起 身开始传述。她今晚没有出现声音或手的变化现象，只是眼睛变黑了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Gratis)</td><td>(自动回 答)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening, sports.</td><td>晚安，运动员。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.  ")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯")。</td></tr><tr><td>Never mind.Cats will be cats.</td><td>不要紧。猫就是猫。</td></tr><tr><td>The drawing is very good.There were three beds in that room. Dick slept in one, the bed that you have pictured.His eldest sister slept in another, and a young brother in the third.There was also a smaller bed in which a maid slept.The family was not rich by any means.The maid was a relative of Throckmorton's.In the beginning she worked for the family to save a decent dowry.However she was no beauty, and Throckmorton never really managed to pay her much above food and lodging.</td><td>这幅画非常好。那个房间里有三张床，迪克睡在其中一张，就是你画的那张床。他的大姐睡另一张床，小弟睡在第三张床。还有一张小床，给女佣睡的。这个家 庭并不富裕。女佣是索罗克莫顿的亲戚。她一开始为这家庭工作，是为了挣到体 面的嫁妆。然而，她也不美丽，而且索罗克莫顿从来没有想过，除了食宿以外再 支付任何报酬。</td></tr><tr><td>She also contracted diphtheria and died at the age of 17.She was the daughter of Throckmorton's half sister.You know her in this life as a relative of, I believe a niece of, your mother's.You will recall that your mother, your present mother, was Dick's oldest sister during that life.</td><td>她也染上了白喉，17 岁就死了。她是索罗克莫顿同父异母的姐妹的女儿。这一世她是你亲戚，你应该认识的，她是你母亲的一个侄女。你应该还记得，你的母 亲，也就是你今世的母亲，在那一世是迪克的大姐。</td></tr><tr><td>The early death of the maid during that existence has overshadowed her present circumstances in her particular case.Because of her death at 17 she finds difficulty in adjusting to womanhood, though she was a female during her brief English life.Nevertheless she was not able, or is not able, to bear children this time.</td><td>在女仆的特殊情况，那一世的早逝给她这一世的生活蒙上了阴影。因为 17 岁时的死亡，她发现很难适应成年女人的生活，虽然她在短暂的英国生活中是个女性。尽管如此，她这一世没有能力生育。</td></tr><tr><td>("In what year did my brother Dick die, during that life?")</td><td>("那一世，我弟弟迪克是在哪一年去世的？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Dick was born in 1671 and died at the age of 9.</td><td>迪克生于 1671 年，9 岁时去世。</td></tr><tr><td>Patricia was the maid, died two years later.Approximately five years after this, the oldest sister went to France; first to a small town outside of Paris and then to Paris, where she lived with French relatives. In this capacity she saved a dowry, working for a very short time for friends of these relatives, and adding these earnings to the goods given to her by her father. As I mentioned earlier, she did marry a cavalry officer, and bore him many children.</td><td>派翠西亚是那个女仆，两年后去世。在这之后大约五年，大姐去了法国；先是去 了巴黎郊外的一个小镇，然后又去了巴黎，住在法国的亲戚家。以这种身份，她 为这些亲戚的朋友们做了很短的工作，再加上她的父亲给她的一些东西，她攒下 了一笔嫁妆。正如我前面提到的，她确实嫁给了一个骑兵军官，并为他生了许多 孩子。</td></tr><tr><td>There were windows on the other side of the room.That is, apparently in your vision you saw the side of the room away from the street.</td><td>房间的另一边有窗户。也就是说，显然在你的灵视中，你看到的是房间远离街道 的一面。</td></tr><tr><td>("That's right."</td><td>("没错"</td></tr><tr><td>(I did not have time to say it here, but when I did the sketch I had the feeling that there might be more than the one bed in the room But these I could not see.I also had the thought that I'd probably made the room look too spacious for the times.)</td><td>(我没有时间在这里说，但是当我画草图的时候，我觉得房间里可能不止一张床， 但是这些我看不到。我也曾想过，就那个时代来说，我可能把房间画得太宽敞 了。)</td></tr><tr><td>These windows were not open however, except in periods of stifling heat which came seldom in England.This room was the front room and not as spacious as your sketch would make it appear.The mattress was straw but the bed itself was the best bed in the family, handed down from Throckmorton's father.Throckmorton and his wife, Lessie, usually slept in it.It was given over to Dick because of his illness.</td><td>然而，这些窗户并没有打开，除了在英国少见的闷热时期。这个房间是前厅，并 不像你画的草图那样宽敞。床垫是稻草，但床本身是家里最好的床，是索罗克莫 顿的父亲传下来的。索罗克莫顿和他的妻子莱西，通常都睡在这张床上。因为迪 克生病，就把床让给了他。</td></tr><tr><td>"The top coverlet was an heirloom from Lessie's family.Outside of the room there was a rickety staircase.On the other side of the staircase was a much smaller room where Throckmorton and Lessie slept during Dick's illness, with a younger boy who was 3 at the time.The stairs led downward to the shop."</td><td>上层的床罩是莱西家的传家宝。房间外面有一个摇摇晃晃的楼梯。楼梯的另一边 是一个更小的房间，在迪克生病期间，索罗克莫顿和莱西就睡在这里，还有一个 当时才 3 岁的小男孩。楼梯向下通向商店。</td></tr><tr><td>Behind the shop was another room that served as a kitchen and, you might say, parlor.In any case it was the family's social room.Behind this was a storeroom with earthen floor, and a shed. An imbecilic boy sometimes did errands for Throckmorton about the shop.He slept in the shed.Lessie had already had and lost 4 children.One actually lived to be 18 and was born when Lessie was very young. The others died in childbirth or in the first year.Throckmorton had wanted a son to carry on his shop.The child who died at 18 would have been such a boy, and Throckmorton never really recovered from the lad's death.He died incidentally of pneumonia: took sick and died within three days.</td><td>店铺后面是另一个房间，作为厨房，也可以说是客厅。无论如何，这是一家人的 社交空间。在这后面是一个泥土地的储藏室，还有一个棚子。一个低能的男孩有 时会在商店里为索罗克莫顿跑腿。他就睡在小棚里。莱西已经有了 4 个孩子，也失去了 4 个孩子。其中一个活到 18 岁，是莱西很年轻时生的。其他的孩子都在分娩时或第一年就死了。索罗克莫顿一直希望有个儿子来继承他的店。18 岁时死去的孩子，就是被这样期待的男孩，索罗克莫顿从未真正从这个小伙子的死亡中恢 复过来。他偶感肺炎死亡：染病后，三天之内就死了。</td></tr><tr><td>A marriage had already been planned between this boy, whose name was Delton, and the daughter of another shopkeeper.</td><td>这个名叫德尔顿的男孩和另一个店主的女儿的婚事都安排好了。</td></tr><tr><td>Throckmorton resented the fact that his eldest was a daughter, and it was for this reason that she was allowed to make the journey to France.She was 23 and unmarried.Since her parents had not married her off, and as she was somewhat of a strain on the family income, Throckmorton gave her a cash settlement.Lessie gave her goods, garments, material and some jewelry, and the parents bid the eldest good-bye.</td><td>索罗克莫顿对自己的老大孩子是女儿感到不满，正是因为这个原因，才准许她去一趟法国。她当时 23 岁，还没有结婚。由于她的父母没有把她嫁出去，对家庭的收入多少是个负担，索罗克莫顿给了她一笔现金安置。莱西把自己的物品、服 装、布料和一些首饰都给了她，然后这对父母向大女儿告别。</td></tr><tr><td>Much love was bestowed upon the boy, Dick, and at his death Throckmorton was all the more bitter against this eldest child.Nor was there any love lost on the young woman's part.She was temperamentally different from the other members of the family.The house was filled with mourning when Dick died.The 3.  year-old boy lived into old age, turning into a prosperous tradesman dealing in wools and textiles.I am unable at present to tell you what Throckmorton's shop actually dealt with.</td><td>大部分的爱都给了迪克这个男孩，在他去世的时候，索罗克莫顿对这个老大女儿 更加痛恨。对这位年轻女子而言，也谈不上失去任何爱。她的性情与家里的其他 成员不同。迪克死的时候，家里充满了悲痛的气氛。那个三岁的男孩活到了老 年，成了一位成功的商人，经营羊毛和纺织品。目前我无法告诉你，索罗克莫顿 的商店到底在经营什么。</td></tr><tr><td>(At this moment I had a mental picture of the sign outside the shop; I was wondering whether Seth could now tell us more about it.)</td><td>(此刻我脑海中浮现出店外的招牌，不知道赛斯现在能否告诉我们更多的信 息。)</td></tr><tr><td>As I mentioned earlier, the sign out front was of a wooden spoon.The maid, or poor relative, was attached strongly to the boy who survived Dick.She never married and did not live to see womanhood.At times I will return to this material.</td><td>正如我刚才所说，外面的招牌是一个木勺。女仆，或者说穷亲戚，对那个活下来 的迪克男孩有着强烈的依恋。她从未结婚，也没活到成年的女性。有空我还会回 到这个资料上。</td></tr><tr><td>The son who did survive, you do not know in your present existence.Throckmorton however is your present father.One of the side chores he has taken upon himself is to do reparation to the eldest daughter, obviously, taking her as his wife in this existence.However she holds strong resentment against him from that earlier treatment.</td><td>那个活下来的儿子，你在这一世不知道他是谁。索罗克莫顿是你现在的父亲。他 在这一世让自己担下的任务之一，就是对大女儿进行补偿，显然，他娶她为妻。然而她对他之前的那种待遇怀有强烈的怨恨。</td></tr><tr><td>They were drawn to each other because of those previous ties, and yet in that past life this daughter was extremely cruel, particularly in speech, to Throckmorton.Sensing of course the bitterness that he felt because she was not a boyâincidentally this is a strong subconscious motiveâthis caused her to bear him three sons to help allay his bitterness.She gave him these three sons as a gift or sacrifice; and when it seemed he would not accept them as such she turned against him, made too much of the sons to pay him back.</td><td>他们因为以前的那些牵扯而被吸引在一起，然而在那个前世中，这个女儿极其残 酷，尤其是在言语上。当然，她感受到了他因为她不是男孩而感到的苦楚—顺带 一提，这是一个强烈的潜意识动机—这使她为他生了三个儿子，以帮他解恨。她 把这三个儿子作为礼物或祭品送给他；当他似乎不领情时，她变得与他对立起 来，过度关注三个儿子来作为报复。</td></tr><tr><td>The relative who is now your mothers niece contributed to some degree to the unrest in the previous family as it existed in England.The young relative was very jealous of the older daughter for her position in the family, and for the dowry which was hers.</td><td>现在是你母亲侄女的这个亲戚，在一定程度上促成了之前英格兰家庭的动🗎。这 位年轻的亲戚非常嫉妒大女儿在家庭中的地位，以及属于她的嫁妆。</td></tr><tr><td>Her clothes were hand-me-downs from the daughter of the family, and since the maid was quite a few years younger than the daughter the clothes fit her poorly.She was glad to see the dissension between the father and the daughter.This time the present personality of the maid tries to make up for the jealousy, and for many quarrels that she initiated secretly between Throckmorton and his daughter, by malicious tattling and playing one member of the family against the other.I suggest you take a brief break, if this material hasn't already broken you up.</td><td>她的衣服都是这家女儿的二手衣，由于女佣比女儿小了不少岁数，衣服很不合 身。她很高兴看到父女之间的分歧。女仆这一世的人格试图弥补嫉妒，弥补之前 她恶意打小报告，暗地里挑拨父女引起的许多争吵。如果这些资料还没有让你崩 溃的话，我建议你稍作休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:37. Resume at 9:50.)</td><td>(9:37 休息 9:50 继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>You made a witty and somewhat frivolous comment, my dear Joseph, during your lengthy period of rest.It should lead you to understand human nature to a better degree than before.If women feel like mothering their husbands or lovers, if men find themselves occasionally amazed, alternating between feelings of sexual love, paternal affection and even boyish pride, as far as their own wives are concerned, now you can see why these feelings are so natural and inevitable.</td><td>亲爱的约瑟，在你们这么长的休息期间，你说了一句颇富机智又有点轻率的评 论。这应该会使你比以前更好地理解人性。如果女人觉得自己像是丈夫或情人的 母亲，如果男人，就他们自己的妻子而言，偶尔会惊讶于自己在性爱、父爱甚至 孩子气的骄傲之间摆🗎，现在你就能明白，为什么这些情感是如此自然和不可避 免。</td></tr><tr><td>"The reason that Dick has had the same father twice is simply that he died at such a young age, before the relationship could be worked out between the two.Dick's wife was also alive in England during Dick's short life.She was the daughter of a baker who lived across the street, and was one of the boy's playmates.The two children were very fond of each other.Both with warm and sunny dispositions.They were attracted to each other at that time, and renewed that relationship in this existence. "</td><td>迪克之所以两次拥有同一个父亲，原因很简单，他太年轻就去世了，两人之间的 关系还没来得及理顺。在迪克短暂的一生中，迪克的妻子也在英国活着。她是住 在对面的一个面包师的女儿，是孩子的玩伴之一。两个孩子非常喜欢对方。两人 的性格都很热情、阳光。他们当时就被对方吸引，并在这一世再续前缘。</td></tr><tr><td>I may add here that they chose to renew this relationship, that is, free will operating in this case as in all others.There are always varieties of personal problems to be worked out, but the time, place and relationship is left to choice.For that matter, a personality can choose to ignore the problems completely, though this is at best a cowardly solution and simply holds the personality back.There is very much detail involved here.Needless to say, Throckmorton could have tried to make reparation to his daughter in a variety of ways, and not necessarily by being her husband.</td><td>我可以在这里补充一下，他们选择了续接这种关系，也就是说，自由意志在此运 作，如同在所有其他的情况下。总是有各种需要解决的个人问题，但时间、地点 和关系是由选择来决定的。对于这个问题，人格可以选择完全忽略问题，不过这 充其量是一种懦弱的解决办法，只是让人格退缩。这里涉及到非常多的细节。不 用说，索罗克莫顿可以通过各种方式来试着对女儿进行补偿，而不一定要做她的 丈夫。</td></tr><tr><td>There was choice also on her part, that is, they chose to be reborn at approximately the same time so that their ages made them contemporaries.In many cases such as this, one or the other waits a longer period of time, being born as a child to the other party.These things fit together very tightly.They are interwoven, and yet loosely applied.</td><td>她也有选择的余地，即他们选择在大约相同的年代出生，这样他们的年龄使他们 成为同时代人。很多像这样的情况，一方或另一方都会等待较长的时间，再出生 成为对方的孩子。这些事情非常紧密地交织在一起。但却松散地应用着。</td></tr><tr><td>These questions are worked out by entities between lives, and each entity has many problems to consider.In your technological age such problems are easier to solve than in the past.That is, contemporaries even from different continents can meet in a simpler fashion.The basic problems are necessarily kept from the personality by the entity simply because so many psychological undercurrents would sweep the ego off its feet, and pull the rug of sanity from beneath it.</td><td>对这些问题，存有是在一世与一世之间解决的，每个存有都有很多问题需要考 虑。在你们这个科技时代，这类的问题比过去更容易解决。也就是说，同时代的人即使来自不同的洲，也能以更简单的方式相遇。基本的问题必然被存有瞒着， 只是因为这么多的心理暗流会把自我扫🗎出去，使他神智不清。</td></tr><tr><td>In some instances this happens despite the personality's attempt to hide the weight of the past.Also on many occasions the personality escapes the problems entirely.What happens here is that the subconscious communicates with the entity through the inner senses, to the effect that the present personality is not strong enough to handle the problem.</td><td>在某些情况下，尽管人格试图隐藏过去的沉重，但这种情况还是发生了。在许多 场合，人格也会完全逃避问题。这里发生的情况是，潜意识通过内在感官与存有 沟通，大意是现在的人格不够强大，无法处理问题。</td></tr><tr><td>The personality then changes course in midstream.Some, but not all, cases of insanity represent the personality's inability to handle a particular problem, while at the same time it refuses to obey the orders from the inner senses to change course.On such occasions data from past lives rushes up or through the inner senses.The personality is no longer capable of shielding itself from this material when it goes beyond a certain point.That is, the personality is now working against itself.</td><td>然后，人格在中途改变了方向。有些，但不是所有的精神错乱案例，代表人格无 力处理某个问题，同时它拒绝服从内在感官的命令去改变路线。在这种情况下， 来自过去生命的资讯就会冲上来，或者通过内在感官而来。当这些资讯超过一定 程度时，人格就不再有能力屏蔽这些资料。也就是说，人格现在是在和自己作对。</td></tr><tr><td>Some controls are still present.These struggle desperately to distort the past data, clothing it in all sorts of idea camouflages and fantasy.In this case insanity is actually a protective mechanism, in that the personality will face almost complete disorientation rather than confront truths in its past that bring up problems it cannot solve.At the same time such a personality will not let go, either, and will not change course.The dilemma is therefore a dire crisis.</td><td>一些控制仍然存在。挣扎着去扭曲过去的资料，为它们穿上各种观念伪装和幻 想。在这种情况下，精神错乱其实是一种保护机制，因为这种人格宁愿完全的迷 失，也不要面对过去的真相，因为这些真相带来了这人格无法解决的问题。同时 这样的人格不会放手，也不会改弦易辙。因此，困境成了可怕的危机。</td></tr><tr><td>I will give a brief sample, if you do not mind me using your own present family.</td><td>如果你不介意我用你自己现在的家庭来举个简单的例子。</td></tr><tr><td>("Go ahead.

will be concerned.</td><td>这在很大程度上取决于任何一种片段的力量，而这种能力和其他任何能力一样， 也是一个限制因素。这是一个我们尚未深入探讨的问题。然而，它是重要的，是 我们后续课程将会关注的基础之一。</td></tr><tr><td>It is this ability which is ever a strong force on your plane, having to do with the building up of particular elements, atoms, neurons and so forth, into camouflage patterns.On your plane you must use this organizing ability to form the camouflage pattern.There are planes with much simpler camouflage patterns, and some inhabited by personalities too weak or limited in this ability, and others inhabited by personalities strong in this ability to use energy, but who no longer need to use it in such a camouflage pattern.</td><td>正是这种能力，在你们层面上，永远是一种强大的力量，它与形成特定元素、原 子、神经元等建立成伪装模式有关。在你的层面上，你必须利用这种组织能力来 形成伪装模式。有的层面的伪装模式要简单得多，有的层面上居住的是这种能力 太弱或有限的人格，有的层面上居住的是这种能量使用能力很强的人格，但他们 已经不需要用这种伪装模式了。</td></tr><tr><td>"Do you want to take a break?I mention this for Joseph, because his fingers seemed cramped.In any case I believe we will close

automatic writing, as far as emotional content is concerned.At least that is my opinion.</td><td>我说的生动艺术与我们现在使用的沟通方法有关。珍说得很对，她认为我更喜欢 对话，尽管我承认这通常相当于独白。而这正是我所说的生动艺术的意思。就情

become like an institution.It is often so one-sided.Also, I enjoy the questions that you do manage to get in.Oftentimes they remind me of other things I would like to say.</td><td>这种交流方式适合我的性情，相信我，我的性情也可能有变化。不知怎么的，至 少对我来说，自动书写有可能变得像一种制度。它往往是那么单方面。另外，我 很喜欢你设法提出的问题。它们常常让我想起我想说的其他事情。</td></tr><tr><td>This is but a brief session.I do not intend to keep you very long, but I am pleased with the letter from Ace; and Jane is right, you have them hooked.And why not?My name was in the book.In any case the two of you are needed, as I mentioned earlier.For one thing we

sacred thing.See how prim that last sentence would sound if it were merely written down without the lively, slightly sardonic inflection which I manage to give to Ruburt's voice?</td><td>我并不想接近睡梦中的鲁伯。我不会那么大胆。女人的睡梦毕竟是一件私密而神 圣的事情。你看，最后一句话如果只是写下来，而没有我设法给鲁伯的声音添加 上的活泼、又略带讽刺的语调，那听起来会多么呆板啊!？</td></tr><tr><td>In any case however, her inner senses were indeed wide open.She forgot to close them before she went to bed.The material was coming through from her own entity.I had kept you up, as it was, long enough.</td><td>然而无论如何，她的内在感官确实是敞开的。她睡觉前忘了关上它们。资料是从 她自己的存有中传过来的。我已经让你熬夜了，像过去一样，太久了。</td></tr><tr><td>This is just a short private little session.I have never completely trusted the written word half as much as I trust the spoken word, and on your plane it is difficult to trust either.But I do not feel that I could be myself as easily if you tried automatic writing, for example.I do not mind speaking through Ruburt's mouth.Somehow the sound of the words is rather pleasant.But seeing myself transformed more or less into plain black and white words on a page of paper seems dull and uninteresting.And I have always enjoyed conversation, which is the liveliest of all arts.And I am speaking now of the social arts, dear Joseph.Already I can see you yelling foul.I did not mean that conversation was on an equal par with painting.</td><td>这只是一次短暂的私人小课。我对书面文字的信任，从来就不到口头言语的一 半，在你们的层面，两者都很难信任。如果你尝试，比如说，用自动书写，我就 不认为我能轻松地做我自己。我不介意透过鲁伯的嘴说话。不知怎的，词语的声 音是令人相当愉快的。但看到自己或多或少地变成一页纸上的白纸黑字，就显得 单调无趣了。而我一向喜欢交谈，这是所有艺术中最生动活泼的。而我现在说的是社会艺术，亲爱的约瑟。我已经看到你在大喊抗议了。我并不是说交谈和绘画 是可以平等并论的</td></tr><tr><td>("I wasn't thinking of it in that way.")</td><td>("我不是这样想的。")。</td></tr><tr><td>This is a very pleasant little session and very enjoyable for a change.For heaven's sake, Ruburt, get yourself a match.The suspension and suspense is killing me.Will she or won't she light that cigarette?Please find a match.</td><td>这是一次非常愉快的小课，改变一下也很有乐趣。看在老天爷的份上，鲁伯，给 自己找根火柴吧。挂在那儿悬念着，让我很难受。她到底要不要点那根烟？请找 一根火柴吧。</td></tr><tr><td>(I got Jane a match from my studio.  )</td><td>(我从我的工作室给珍找了根火柴)。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true that Joseph receives much data through inner visions.In the past he has more or less translated this data automatically into a new camouflage pattern, in other words into a painting, without realizing that he had received any vision at all.You can learn, Joseph, to use your other inner senses as I tell you more about them.</td><td>约瑟确实通过内在视象接收了很多资料。在过去，他已经或多或少地将这些资料 自动转化为新的伪装模式，换句话说，转化为一幅画，而他根本没有意识到自己 已经收到了任何视象。约瑟，你可以学习使用你的其他内在感官，我会告诉你更 多关于它们的信息。</td></tr><tr><td>Because Ruburt deals in words it is easy for me to communicate in this manner.That is, Ruburt automatically translates inner data given by me into coherent, valid and faithful camouflage patterns, into words.The data that I give is not actually sound on my part.The transference of my data is automatic and instantaneous on Ruburt's part and is performed through the inner workings of the mind, the inner senses and the brain.</td><td>由于鲁伯善用文字，所以我用这种方式交流很容易。也就是说，鲁伯会自动将我 给出的内在资料转化为连贯一致、有效可靠的伪装模式，转化为文字。我给出的 资料其实并不是我的声音。我的资料的转移在鲁伯方面是自动的、瞬间的，是通 过心智、内在感官和头脑的内部运作来完成的。</td></tr><tr><td>It is much more difficult for this data to be transformed by you, Joseph, and Ruburt is right here, because you are sensitive to inner visual data, and pictures that you get in this way would frequently need interpretation.</td><td>这种资料由你，约瑟，来转化就困难多了，而鲁伯就在这里，而且你对内在视觉 资料很敏感，这样得到的画面会经常需要转译。</td></tr><tr><td>It just happens that Ruburt's ability happens to lie along the easiest route as far as these communications are concerned.That is, both of you have pursued separate abilities because of the bent of your particular personalities.You will go on now to develop other senses as you learn of them.The problem is not only to receive data through the inner senses in an undistorted and coherent manner, but also of translating this data into the particular camouflage patterns with which you are familiar.</td><td>鲁伯的能力恰好就在这些沟通的最简单的路线上。也就是说，因为你们各自特殊 人格的偏好，而追随了各自的能力。你们现在将随着对其他感官的了解而继续发 展它们。问题不仅在于通过内在感官以不失真和连贯的方式接收资料，还在于将 这些资料转化为你们所熟悉的特殊伪装模式。</td></tr><tr><td>I am sorry that this involved Ruburt with so much work voice wise, and that it involves you Joseph with so much hand work.I do go along with your individual talents, making use of them when I can, and helping you to develop abilities that you have let lie unused and

such arts.I believe that it is usually considered that an art is more powerful if it appeals to as many outer senses as possible.That is, you would perhaps think that a statue would be extremely lifelike because it exists in space and depth, having width and girth.That is, you can feel it, see it and touch it.</td><td>你要用一种与通常讨论这类艺术时相反的方式来看待这个问题。我相信，通常认 为，如果一门艺术能够尽可能地吸引更多的外在感官，它的力量就会更大。也就 是说，你可能会认为一尊雕像会非常逼真，因为它存在于空间和深度中，有宽度 和周长。也就是说，你可以感觉到它，看到它，触摸到它。</td></tr><tr><td>You must remember that the outer senses react to camouflage pattern.The statue actually imprisons vitality more than a painting or musical composition or poem, because it is bound to you by so many ties.I meant to make this plain earlier.I won't keep you any longer, lest you grow impatient with me tomorrow.At all costs I don't want to wear out my welcome.</td><td>你一定要记住，外在感官对伪装模式做出的反应。雕像其实比一幅画、一首乐曲 或一首诗更能禁锢生命力，因为它对你的束缚太多。我刚才是想把这个问题说清 楚。我不再耽误你时间了，免得你明天对我不耐烦。不惜一切代价，我也不想让 我的欢迎度耗尽。</td></tr><tr><td>("You're

and so does it change shape and content, and so does it show many faces and yet never disappears.And as air seems invisible so does this vitality seem invisible, and yet like air this vitality gives shape to every object that you see, and so does it form every camouflage.Without it all camouflage would vanish.And so the ability to use this vitality well is as necessary to life as is the necessity to use air for breathing.</td><td>我相信，我们在以前的一次课程上，已经用空气做了比喻，把它比作宇宙的生命 力。由于空气以各种形式从肺部排出，并被使用和重复使用，而不会损失任何力 量、强度或数量，我们所说的生命力也是以不同的方式被使用。它作为一种东西 多次进入，也作为不同的东西多次出现；它的形状和内容也在变化，它展示许多 面貌，却从未消失。就像空气似乎看不见一样，这种生命力也似乎看不见，然而 就像空气一样，这种生命力赋予你所看到的每一个物体以形状，所以它形成了每 一种伪装。没有它，所有的伪装都会消失。因此，善用这种生命力的能力，就像 使用空气呼吸一样，是生命的必要条件。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take a short break.</td><td>我建议你稍作休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:35.Jane said the sentences making up this message were so long and involved that she made no effort to pay any attention to them while voicing them.This seemed strange to her because as a writer she is used to watching out for grammar, punctuation, etc.</td><td>(9:35 休息。珍说，这条信息的句子太长，涉及面也太广了，但她说的时候，居然没花力气去注意它们。这让她觉得很奇怪，因为作为一个作家，她习惯于注意 语法和标点符号等。</td></tr><tr><td>(When I told her she had been pacing at a faster rate than ever before, she said it felt very effortless.She was not at all tired.This was the first time she had been aware of such a feeling.She resumed at 9:43.)</td><td>(当我告诉她，她踱步的节奏比以前更快时，她说感觉很轻松。她一点也不累。这是她第一次觉知到这样的感觉。9:43 继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now I wish to make another point along these lines.No one, I am sure, denies the existence of air because ordinarily you do not see it.No one denies the existence of air because they do not understand the method by which their own lungs breathe. Yet they know that they breathe, and they know that without breath death is inevitable.To deny the existence of air would seem ridiculous.It is just as ridiculous to deny this vitality because it is usually unseen, or because you do not understand how you use it.</td><td>现在，沿着这些思路我想再说一点。我相信没有人通常因为看不到空气而否认空 气的存在。没有人因为不了解自己肺部的呼吸方式而否认空气的存在，他们知道 自己在呼吸，他们知道没有呼吸，必死无疑。否认空气的存在，似乎很可笑。否 认这种生命力也是同样的荒谬，因为，它通常也是看不见、你也不了解自己是如 何使用了它。</td></tr><tr><td>Some part of the individual is aware of the most minute portions of breath, some part of the individual knows immediately of the most minute particle of oxygen and components that enters the lung.The thinking mind, or I had better say the thinking brain, does not know.Your all-important "I" does not know.</td><td>个体的某些部分，能觉知到呼吸的最微小部分，个体的某些部分，能立即知道进 入肺部的最微小的氧气粒子和成分。而会思维的心智，我最好还是说，会思维的 头脑，并不知道。你那顶尖重要的"我"也不知道。</td></tr><tr><td>In actuality, my dear friends, the all-important "I" does know.You do not know the all-important "I", and therein lies your difficulty.It is fashionable in your time to consider man, or man's "I", as the product of the brain and an isolated bit of the subconscious, with a few odds and ends thrown in for good measure.</td><td>实际上，我亲爱的朋友，那顶尖重要的"我"是知道的。因为你并不了解这顶尖重要的"我"，才是你的困难点。在你们这个时代，很流行把人，或者说人的  " 我"，看成是大脑的产物，和一丁点孤立的潜意识，还有为了好的衡量而额外扔进 来的一些零碎东西。</td></tr><tr><td>Therefore, with such an unnatural division it seems to man that he does not know himself.He says "I breathe, but who breathes, since consciously I cannot tell myself to breathe or not to breathe?"He says "I dream, but who dreams?I cannot tell myself to dream or not to dream." He cuts himself in half, then wonders why he is not whole.Even in my own lifetimes on your plane I sensed this basic contradiction.Man has consistently admitted to the evidence only those things he could see, smell, touch or hear, and in so doing he could only appreciate half of himself.And when I say half of himself I exaggerate.He is aware of only a third of himself, because two-thirds of himself exists in that realm to which he will not admit.</td><td>因此，在这样不自然的划分下，人似乎不了解自己。他说："我呼吸，但谁呼吸， 因为在意识上我不能告诉自己呼吸或不呼吸？" 他说："我做梦，但谁做梦呢？我不能告诉自己做梦或不做梦。" 他把自己切成两半，然后又想不通为什么自己不是完整的。即使当我自己生活在你们的层面上时，我也感知到了这个基本的矛 盾。人类向来只承认那些他能看到、闻到、摸到或听到的东西，这样做他只能欣赏到一半的自己。当我说一半的自己时，我夸大了。他只意识到三分之一的自 己，因为三分之二的自己存在于他不愿承认的那个领域。</td></tr><tr><td>It is as if a man found himself in a completely dark room, into which no sounds came.And he looked down, could not see his body, could not hear his voice, and therefore deduced that he had no body and no voice, even though he knew he had both a body and a voice before he entered that room.But he says "I will at any moment believe only what I can see, and though I am sure that I saw more at one time, now I can see nothing and so I have no body, since I cannot see it."</td><td>就好像一个人发现自己身处在一个完全黑暗的房间里，没有声音传进来。他低头 看不到自己的身体，听不到自己的声音，因此推断自己没有身体，也没有声音， 尽管他在进入那个房间之前，就知道自己既有身体又有声音。但他说："不论何时，我只相信我所能看到的东西，虽然我确信我曾经看到过更多的东西，但现在 我什么也看不到，所以我没有身体，因为我看不到。"</td></tr><tr><td>With the hands that he does not think he has, our imaginary man then feels the contours of his body.But does this help him in his dilemma?No.  He yells witchcraft.If someone else says "Oh, I feel a body," he says "You are a medium. " Or, if you prefer, a crackpot.The fact remains that you have within yourself the evidence.</td><td>用他认为没有的手，我们想象中的人就会感觉到自己身体的轮廓。但这对他的困 境有帮助吗？没有。他大叫这是巫术。如果有人说："哦，我感觉到了身体"，他会说，"你是一个灵媒"。或者，如果你比较喜欢，也可以说是一个疯子。事 实是，证据，就在你自己之内。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break.</td><td>我建议休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>You will notice I am sure that the brief breaks are getting briefer in duration; and yet I am letting you break more often but for shorter periods.This material, you will find, will be a basis for other material that will come, and I prefer to give it to you before we go any further into a study of time.</td><td>我确信你会注意到，休息的时间越来越短；然而我让你们休息的次数越来越多， 但休息时间比较短。你会发现，这个资料将是未来其他资料的基础，在我们进一 步研究时间之前，我想先把这些资料提供给你们。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:00.Jane resumed her fast pacing when we began again at 10:04. )</td><td>(10:00 休息。10:04 再次开始时，珍又恢复了她的快节奏。</td></tr><tr><td>If man does not know who breathes within him, and if man does not know who dreams within him, it is not because there is one who acts in the physical world and one completely separate who dreams and breathes.It is because he has buried the part of himself which breathes and dreams.If these functions seem so automatic as to be performed by someone completely divorced from himself, it is because he has done the divorcing.This is not the case on all planes.It is not even the case on planes that you might consider lower than your own, nor is it the case with some portions of life that you consider beneath you on your own plane.</td><td>如果人不知道谁在他内部呼吸，如果人不知道谁在他内部做梦，那不是因为有一 个人在物质世界中活动，而有一个完全独立的人在做梦和呼吸。而是因为他把自 己呼吸和做梦的部分埋没了。如果这些功能似乎很自动，好像是与自己完全分离 的人执行的，这是因为他自己做了分离。所有的层面都不是这种情况。甚至你可 能认为，比你自己层面低的层面，也不是这样，而在你自己的层面上，你认为低 于你们的某些生物，也不是这样。</td></tr><tr><td>It is not in any manner inevitable or a law of the universe.Far from it.For some reason mankind as a species on your plane has become much more attached to its camouflage patterns than most other kinds of consciousness.And with some important exceptions, all types of consciousness do have their peculiar camouflage patterns to which they more or less adhere.</td><td>无论如何，这既不是必然也不是宇宙规律。远非如此。出于某种原因，人类作为 你们层面上的一个物种，已经变得比其他大多数种类的意识更依附它的伪装模 式。而除了一些重要的例外，所有类型的意识确实都有它们特有的伪装模式，它 们或多或少都会遵守这些模式。</td></tr><tr><td>It is on your part more than anything else, a simple refusal to admit into existence anything that is not a camouflage pattern.Camouflage patterns are of course, with again some exceptions, essentials on any plane, since each type represents the actual form of the plane and the various characteristics within it.Nevertheless it is possible, and actually much more efficient and simple, to accept this fact and also realize and admit the inner vitality behind the camouflage.</td><td>在你们这里，比什么都重要的是，只要不是伪装模式，就简单地拒绝承认它的存 在。伪装模式在任何层面上都是必不可少的，当然，也有一些例外，因为每一种 类型都代表了其所在层面的实际形态和在其内的各种特征。尽管如此，接受这个 事实、了解并承认伪装背后的内在生命力是可能的，实际上是非常有效而且简单 的。</td></tr><tr><td>I mentioned somewhat earlier that oftentimes the consciousness becomes the subconscious and vice versa.This should certainly come as no surprise.You are familiar with it in your everyday existence.It is not some isolated occurrence that happens once in a lifetime, and yet as a rule mankind has ignored this completely.In sleep the conscious becomes actually the subconscious and the subconscious, in the most real manner, becomes conscious.Every man instinctively knows this simple fact, and yet every man stubbornly refuses to admit it.</td><td>我在前面提到过，意识常常会变成潜意识，反之亦然。这当然不应该感到意外。你在日常生活中对它很熟悉。这并不是一生只发生一次的什么孤立事件，然而作 为常规，人类完全忽略了这一点。在睡眠中，意识实际上变成了潜意识，而潜意 识，以最真实的方式变成了意识。每个人都本能地知道这个简单的事实，然而每 个人都固执地拒绝承认。</td></tr><tr><td>The part of you who dreams is the "I" as much as the part of you that operates in any other manner.The part of you who dreams is the part of you who breathes.And this part is certainly as legitimate and actually more necessary to you as a whole unit, as far as survival on your physical plane is concerned, than the part that also plays bridge or Scrabble.It would seem ludicrous to suppose that such a vital matter as breathing would be left to a subordinate and almost completely divorced poor-relative sort of a lesser personality.</td><td>你做梦的那部分，与你以其他方式运作的那部分一样，都是"我"。你做梦的那部 分就是你呼吸的那部分。而这部分对你作为一个整体单位来说，就你的物质层面 的生存而言，肯定是合理的，实际上比你打桥牌或拼字游戏的那部分更加必要。假设把呼吸这样攸关生死的大事，交给一个附属的、像个几乎完全分离的穷亲戚 那种较小的人格，那就显得荒唐可笑了。</td></tr><tr><td>As breathing is carried on in a manner that seems automatic to the conscious mind, so this important function of transforming the vitality of the universe into pattern units also seems to be carried on automatically.But this transformation is not as apparent to the one part of yourself that you are pleased to recognize, and therefore it seems as if this transformation is carried on by someone even more distant and alien than the unrecognized part of yourself that breathes.</td><td>由于呼吸是以一种对意识心来说，似乎是以自动的方式在进行，所以，把宇宙的 生命力转化为模式单位的这一重要功能，似乎也是自动进行的。但是，这种转化 对于你乐于承认的自己的那部分来说，并不那么明显，因此，这种转化似乎是由 一个，比你那未被承认的，呼吸的自己那部分，更遥远、更陌生的人执行的。</td></tr><tr><td>You would most probably not even admit that you breathed at all if you did not have tangible evidence before your eyes, and yet you have the evidence of the camouflage world of physical appearance before your eyes; you accept it and make up farfetched fantasies to explain its existence rather than face the facts.</td><td>如果你眼前没有实实在在的证据，你很可能根本不会承认自己在呼吸，然而你眼 前却有伪装世界的物质外观的证据，你接受它，并编造出牵强的幻想来解释它的 存在，而不是面对事实。</td></tr><tr><td>The facts are simply that you yourselves form these camouflage patterns, and I repeat this simple statement:You form the camouflage world of appearances with the same part of you that breathes.You do not admit the breather as really being a part of yourselves, nor do you admit the creator of the camouflaged physical world as being part of yourselves.</td><td>事实就是，你们自己形成了这些伪装模式，我重复这句简单的陈述。你们用自己 呼吸的那部分，形成了伪装世界的外观。你们不承认那呼吸者，真的是你们自己 的一部分，也不承认伪装的物质世界的创造者，是你们自己的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>Because you know that somehow you breathe, without consciously being aware of the actual mechanics being involved, you are forced despite your inclinations to admit that you do do your own breathing.When you cross a room you are forced to admit that you have caused yourself to cross the room, even though consciously you have no idea of willing the muscles to move or of stimulating one muscle or another; and yet even there, though you admit these things, you do not believe them.In your quiet unguarded moments you still say who breathes, who dreams, and even who moves?How much easier it would be to admit freely and wholeheartedly the simple fact that you are not consciously aware of important vital parts of yourself, and that you are more than you know you are.</td><td>因为你们知道自己以某种方式在呼吸，而并没有有意识地觉知到，所涉及的实际 机制，所以不顾自己的倾向，你们被迫承认，确实是自己在进行呼吸。当你穿过 房间时，你不能不承认，是你让自己穿过房间，然而在意识上，你并不知道你有 意地命令肌肉移动，或刺激一块肌肉或另一块肌肉；然而即使就在那里，就算你 承认这些事情，你也不相信它们。在你安静没设防的时候，你还是会说，谁在呼 吸，谁在做梦，甚至谁在动？心甘情愿地承认这个简单的事实，会是多么容易 啊，承认，你并没有有意识地觉知你自己至关重要的部分，你也没有觉知，你不 只是你所知道的你。</td></tr><tr><td>But since it is so difficult for man to even recognize the self that moves his own muscles and breathes his own breath, then I suppose it should not be startling that he cannot realize that this whole self also forms the camouflage world of physical appearance, in almost the same manner that he forms a pattern with his breath upon a glass pane.</td><td>但是，既然人这么难意识到，是自己活动自己的肌肉，呼吸自己的呼吸，那么我 想，如果他不能认识到，是整体自己形成了物质外观的伪装世界，如同他哈气在 玻璃片上形成图案一样，应该也不那么让人吃惊了。</td></tr><tr><td>Again I suggest a brief break.</td><td>我再次建议短暂的休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:32.During break Jane seemed to become aware of several things at once.She said she thought she'd been in a trance of some kind almost from the beginning of the session.She had no memory of frying the above monologue; she said it was as though she had "vanished." I told her that of course she was with me all the time, pacing so fast that at times it was distracting.The material, she said, came through with no distortion at all.She felt as though she were a pure vehicle; she had no conscious thoughts about it, she was hardly aware of her environment at all.She had a vague memory of picking up a wineglass once.Actually I had watched her smoke a couple of cigarettes while dictating, pace back and forth, pause to look out the windows, etc.She did not feel tired, nor had her voice shown any changes."</td><td>(10:32 休息。休息期间，珍似乎同时意识到了几件事。她说她觉得自己从课程一开始就处于某种恍惚状态。她对炒出上述独白没有记忆，她说她好像 "消失了"。我告诉她，她当然一直和我在一起，踱步的速度很快，有时让人分心。她说传过来的资料，完全没有失真。她觉得自己仿佛是一个纯粹的载体，她没有任何意识上的想法，她几乎完全不知道自己所处的环境。她有拿起酒杯的模糊记忆。其实我曾看她一边传述一边抽了几支烟，来回踱步，停下来看看窗外的风景等等。她并不觉得累，声音也没有任何变化。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane also now became aware of her "fat" hands again.She said they felt as though there was flesh between the fingers that she was not used to having there.We examined them.They were wet, and to me the fingers appeared thicker.Again, she could not get one of her rings back on.</td><td>(珍现在又意识到自己的手很 "胖"。她说，手指间好像多了以前没有的肉。我们检查了一下手。手指是湿的，而且我觉得手指似乎更粗了。她戴不上戒指。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed dictation at 10:42.  )</td><td>(珍在 10:42 继续传述)。</td></tr><tr><td>Without knowing what he was doing Ruburt has been developing his inner senses to an almost amazing degree, but naturally he did this unknowingly, pursuing other aims.In the past he was so bound to the conscious ego that in fiction he found it difficult to write anything that was not strictly autobiographical.</td><td>鲁伯不知道自己在做什么，他的内在感官已经发展到了一个近乎惊人的程度，他在追求着其他的目标时，在不自觉中，自然而然地做到了这一点。过去，他是那么局限于有意识的自我，以至于在小说中，他很难写出 任何不是严格意义上的自传的作品。</td></tr><tr><td>The poetry has always been the result of facility in use of the inner senses, but until lately he was unable to give this sufficient pattern in terms of unitary form.His efforts in the book The Physical World as idea Construction represented a breakthrough on his part.He realized, I believe, from the beginning that the conscious critical mind had little to do with the initial conception.</td><td>诗歌一直是运用内在感官这个配置的结果，就这(诗歌的)单一形式而言，直到最 近，他才有能力给出充足的模式。他在《理念建构的物质世界》这本书上的努 力，代表了他的一个突破。我相信，他从一开始就意识到，有意识的批判性思维 与最初的构思关系不大。</td></tr><tr><td>The book was a first attempt in forming a definite pattern of the material that he was receiving from the inner senses.He was beginning to recognize the whole self.The only reason the whole self is not much more conscious and accessible is your own stubborn refusal to admit it.I cannot emphasize this more strongly.The camouflage pattern world is formed by the mind, and I am using this now in its true term as a part of the inner world.Energy is received by the mind through the inner senses and transformed by use of mental enzymes into camouflage patterns.</td><td>这本书是他把从内在感官接收的资料，形成一种明确模式的第一次尝试。他开始 认识整体自己。整体自己之所以那么不被意识到、不被接触到，唯一的原因是你 自己顽固地拒绝承认它。我再怎么强烈地强调这一点也不为过。伪装模式的世界 是由心智所形成，我现在这么说，因为它真真切切地是内在世界的一部分。能量 通过内在感官被心智所接收，并利用精神酵素转化为伪装模式。</td></tr><tr><td>There is no reason why mankind cannot be aware of this transformation, if once he admits into existence the whole self which makes this possible.As I mentioned earlier the process of breathing seems automatic, and yet some part of you is aware of the most minute portions of air that inflate the lungs.</td><td>如果人类一旦承认，存在着使之成为可能的整体自己，就没有理由不意识到这种 转化。正如我前面提到的，呼吸的过程似乎是自动的，然而你的某个部分却能意 识到，使肺部充气的空气中最细微的部分。</td></tr><tr><td>You, or the part of you that you are pleased to call yourself, refuse to admit as part of yourself the "I" that is aware of every breath you breathe, every move you make, and every dream that you dream.In other words breathing and dreaming are not automatic, nor do they operate without your knowledge.Mankind simply refuses to admit the breather and the dreamer.</td><td>你，或者你乐于自称为你的那部分你，拒绝承认 "我 "是你自己的一部分，它意识到你呼吸的每一次呼吸，你的每一个动作，以及你所做的每一个梦。换句话说， 呼吸和做梦不是自动的，也不是在你不知情的情况下运作的。人类只是拒绝承认那个呼吸者和做梦者。</td></tr><tr><td>(By now Jane's delivery was really wound up.Though she did not talk much faster she emphasized the words more, used more gestures, and paced about even more rapidly.However I had the feeling she was not in as deep a trance state as before.Her hands still bothered her also; she had taken off one ring at the start of the session but had left her wedding ring on; now she was trying to get that one off too, but without success. )"</td><td>(现在，珍的传述已经真正上了发条。虽然她说话的语速并不快，但她强调的词语 更多，使用的手势更多，踱步的节奏也更快。不过我感觉她的状态已经不像以前那样深沉恍惚了。她的手也还在困扰着她，她在课程开始时摘下了一枚戒指，但结婚戒指一直戴在手上；现在她想把那枚结婚戒指也摘下来，但没成功。)</td></tr><tr><td>In many cases he refuses to admit the mover.He trusts himself much more when he says "I will read," and then he reads, than he does when he says "I will see," and then he sees.He remembers having learned consciously to read, but he does not remember consciously having learned to see.And what he cannot remember consciously he fears, and what he fears he simply denies existence to.</td><td>在许多情况下，他拒绝承认移动者。当他说"我要读" 然后就能读，比起他说"我要看"然后就能看，他更确信自己能够读。因为在他的记忆中，他曾有意识 地学过阅读，但他不记得曾有意识地学过去看。他对有意识当中没有记忆的东西 会害怕，而对害怕的东西，他干脆抵赖它的存在。</td></tr><tr><td>The fact is, he sees although no one taught him how to see.And the part of himself that did teach him to see still guides his movements, still moves the muscles of his eyes, still becomes conscious despite him when he sleeps, still breathes for him without thanks, without recognition, and still carries on his task of transforming energy from an inner reality to an outer camouflage.</td><td>事实是，虽然没有人教，他也可以观看。而确实教会他看的那部分自己，仍然指 导着他的举动，仍然继续活动着他眼睛的肌肉，当他睡去，这个意识仍然还是清 醒着、仍然无需感谢、无需认可地呼吸着，仍然进行着，从内在实相把能量转化 成为外在伪装的任务。</td></tr><tr><td>He becomes trapped by his own artificially-divided self.He looks for gods, anything at all, to explain perfectly natural functions that belong to him.This beautifully absolves him in his own eyes from all responsibility, but it does not.I have been speaking here only, if you will believe it, of personalities in their particular lives as they operate on your plane, and I have much to say.</td><td>他被自己人为分割的自己所困。他寻找神明等任何东西，来完美地解释本就属于 他的自然功能。这漂亮地免除了他自己眼中的一切责任，但事实并非如此。我在 这里只讲了，你愿意相信的话，在你们层面的运作中，那个特定生存中的人格， 我还有很多话要说。</td></tr><tr><td>You must remember, and this is I'm afraid a sideline: but I must communicate this data to you by words which must necessarily be strung out in order, end to end, when now to me there is no such necessity, and I will go into this further.As I began to say, I have been speaking of your plane and the personalities upon it.Now I will go into this further, into the entities involved.</td><td>你们一定要记住，这恐怕是个旁枝末节：但我必须把这些资料用文字传达给你 们，而这些文字必然要按顺序串起来，从头到尾，而现在对我来说，却没这必要 了，我将进一步探讨这个问题。正如我开始说的，我一直在讲你们的层面和层面 上的人格。现在我将进一步探讨这个内容，探讨其中所涉及的存有。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true that as a rule you are not aware of your whole entity, which as a rule does not reside within your boundaries.But there is no reason why you must be blind to the whole self of your present personality, which is part of your entity, and which can be glimpsed on your plane in terms of the breathing and dreaming self of which I have spoken.</td><td>一般来说，你的确并不知悉你的整体存有，整体存有通常也不居住在你们的范围 内。但是，你可没有理由一定要无视当前人格的整体自己，整体自己是你存有的 一部分，在你的层面上，可借着我说过的呼吸的、做梦的自己瞥见它。</td></tr><tr><td>Another thing.It is in some ways convenient that you are not consciously aware of each breath that you take.But it is sheer stupidity to ignore the inner self which does the breathing, and is aware of the mechanics involved.What you almost get here is that some little unknown self performs these necessary functions, and that is not the case.I have said that the mind is a part of the inner world, but you have access to your own minds which you ignore, and this access would lead you inevitably to the truths about the physical world.Working inward you could understand the outward so much more clearly.</td><td>还有一件事。你没有有意识地觉知到你所做的每一次呼吸，这在某些方面是一种 方便。但是，如果忽略那个执行呼吸、也觉知呼吸所涉及的机制的内在自己，那 是纯粹的愚蠢。你在这里几乎以为，某个未知的小小自己在执行这些必要的功 能，而事实并非如此。我曾说过，心智是内在世界的一部分，你可以接触到你自 己的心智，但你却忽略了，这种接触将不可避免地把你引向关于物质世界的真相。向内努力，你可以更清楚地理解外在。</td></tr><tr><td>Because I say that you actually create the typical camouflage patterns of your own physical universe yourselves, by use of the inner vitality of the universe in the same manner that you form a pattern with your breath on a glass pane, I do not necessarily mean that you are the creators of the universe.I merely am saying that you are the creators of the physical world as you know itâand herein, my beloved friends, lies a vast tale.</td><td>因为我说，你们其实是自己创造了自己物质宇宙的典型伪装模式，利用宇宙内在 的生命力，就像你们在玻璃板上哈气形成图案一样，我的意思不一定是说你们是 宇宙的创造者。我只是说，你们是你们所知道的物质世界的创造者--这里，我亲 爱的朋友们，蕴藏着一个浩瀚的故事。</td></tr><tr><td>Nor do I know all the answers.It is however a fact that even mankind, in his blundering manner, will discover that he himself creates his own physical universe, and that the mechanisms of the physical body have more functions and varieties than he knows.Nor in the sleeping state are these functions stilled.They continue in an even more direct form than they do when he is awake.He creates when he dreams in a truer and less distorted fashion, and his physical world is much more the product of his dreaming self than it is of his waking state.</td><td>我也不知道所有的答案。然而，事实是，即使是人类，在他的糊涂中，也会发 现，他自己创造了他自己的物质宇宙，而肉身形体的机制有更多的功能和种类， 是他所不知道的。在睡眠状态下，这些功能也不是静止的。它们以一种比他清醒 时更直接的形式继续着。当他做梦时，他以一种更真实、更少扭曲的方式进行创 造，与他醒时的创造相比，他的物质世界更多的是他做梦的自己的产物。</td></tr><tr><td>This is not meant to discourage the intellect, but the intellect has never yet been used for the purpose for which it was developed.I suggest a brief break, and may I say that I am unusually pleased with tonight's session, and with Ruburt's performance, since this material is coming to you without any distortion whatsoever, as far as I can tell.This is indeed our best session to date.</td><td>这并不是要打击智力，但智力还没有被用于原本发展它的目的上。我建议稍作休 息，请允许我说，我对今晚的课程，以及鲁伯的表现异常满意，因为据我所知， 这些资料是在没有任何失真的情况下传给你们的。这的确是我们迄今为止最好的 一节。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:18.During this monologue Jane was not as far out, she said, yet was still "away"" while talking.

but you have made it seem necessary because of your refusal to admit the inner self as part of your whole personality, and therefore you have not been able to utilize psychological time to its fullest advantage on your plane.Psychological time as I have said is a natural pathway, part of an inner sense, that was meant as an easy access from the inner to the outer world and back again.You do not use it as such.</td><td>外在的物理时间是一种完全的伪装，在你的层面上基本上是不必要的；但你由于 拒绝承认内在的自己是你整体人格的一部分，所以你使它显得很有必要，因此你 在你的层面上未能充分利用心理时间。我说过，心理时间是一种自然的途径，是 内在感官的一部分，它的本意是作为从内在到外在世界，再回到内在的便捷通道。你并没有这样使用它。</td></tr><tr><td>This is one of the reasons why breathing seems automatic, and why dreaming seems to confound your physical camouflage idea of time.It is perfectly within your present capabilities to understand that time, to your dreaming self, is very much like time to your waking inner self.But you must first disconnect the physical concept of time and watches.</td><td>这也是为什么呼吸似乎是自动的，为什么梦境似乎困惑了你的物理伪装时间概念 的原因之一。在你现在的能力范围内，你完全可以理解，时间，对你做梦的自己 来说，很像时间对你醒着的内在自己。但你必须首先断掉时间和钟表的物理概念。</td></tr><tr><td>This concept is one of the easiest to explore, since as I have said your clock time is one of the most artificial of your camouflages.The time concept in dreams may seem far different than your conception of time in the waking state, when you have your eyes on a clock and are concerned with getting to some destination by, say, 12:15.But it is not so different from time in the waking state when you are sitting alone in a room with your thoughts, and with no particular need to get anywhere.</td><td>这个概念是最容易探索的概念之一，因为正如我说过，钟表时间是你们最人造的 伪装之一。梦中的时间概念可能看起来与你在清醒状态下的时间概念大相径庭， 当你的眼睛盯着一个时钟，关心的是如何在，比如说 12:15 之前，到达某个目的地。这与你清醒状态下独自坐在房间，想着自己的想法，没有特别需要去那里的 这种时间，并没有太大的不同。</td></tr><tr><td>You will I am sure see the similarity now between this inner, alone sort of psychological time, experienced very often in waking hours, and the sense of time experienced in dreams.This is meant to show you but one more point of similarity between the waking and sleeping selves.In other words it is meant as another proof that they are indeed but one self, and that any divisions between them are artificial.</td><td>我确信，你现在可以看到，这种在醒时经常经历的独自的内在心理时间，和在梦 中经历的时间感之间的相似性。这是要向你说明，醒时的自己和睡着的自己之间 的另一个相似点。换句话说，它的意思是作为另一个证明，证明它们确实是一个 自己，而它们之间的任何划分都是人为的。</td></tr><tr><td>The intellect is extremely important in the manipulation of camouflage patterns once they are created.You have made your world, and your intellect should help you deal with what you have created.It has other vital functions which I shall enumerate at a later date.However, I cannot say this too often:You are more than your conscious mind, much more, and the self which you do not admit happens to be the portion of yourself which not only insures your own survival in the physical universe which it has made, but which is also the connective portion of yourself with inner reality.Which is, when all is said and done, the only basic reality; and which also continually enables you to create these camouflage patterns, and which contains knowledge and intuitions and memories which you need in a most desperate manner if you are ever to understand yourselves, and if the race of mankind is ever to evolve to its fullest.</td><td>伪装模式一旦被创造出来，智力在操纵伪装模式上就极其重要。你已经创造了你 的世界，你的智力应该帮助你处理你所创造的东西。它还有其他重要的功能，我 将在以后列举。然而，我再怎么经常说也不为过。就是，你远远不只是你有意识 的心智，你不承认的自己，恰好是你自己的一部分，它不仅保证了你自己在已经 创造的物质宇宙中的生存，而且也是你与内在实相连接的那部分的自己。归根究 底，这就是唯一的基本现实；它持续地使你能够创造这些伪装模式，它也包含了</td></tr><tr><td>It is only through the use of this inner man, through the recognition of the functions of this inner man, that the race will ever use its potential.

When it first swept over me, I wondered if the wine was responsible, though actually I had drunk very little.</td><td>(我们有客人。我刚喝完第一小杯酒，一股感觉从脚到头席卷了我。就像一种放 大的刺痛，或者说是刺激，弥漫全身，从腿部涌到腹腔和胸腔，我感觉自己好像会被擡起来，然后被卷走。第一次的感觉没有后面两次那么强烈，当它第一次席 卷我时，我怀疑是不是酒的作用，但其实我喝的很少。</td></tr><tr><td>(I waited quietly, and in a moment or two the sensation was gone.I was balanced on an arm of our davenport talking to our company.I had the odd feeling that the sensation was related both to the subject of conversation, and to some kind of message or communication I sensed or felt within; I believe that each time I experienced it, I was involved in talk about other people; relatives, children at perhaps parents.</td><td>(我静静地等着，一会儿那种感觉就消失了。我平衡地坐在沙发的扶手上和我们 的客人说话。我有一种奇怪的感觉，这种感觉既与谈话的主题有关，也与我内心 感知或感觉到的某种信息或交流有关；我相信每次我经历这种感觉时，我都是在 谈论其他人，亲戚、孩子，也许是父母。</td></tr><tr><td>(The next two sensations appeared somewhat later in the evening.The second one came perhaps after 11:30 PM, while we were sitting around the table eating.This sensation was so strong that I put down my sandwich and took off my glasses, because I literally did not know what to expect next.The wave of feeling washed over me very strongly.Although everyone about me was talking quite loudly, I had the weird sensation of voices within me, of mouths open or crying in soundless rhythm.I also felt, or sensed or perhaps glimpsed, a great chute or trough or pathway of some kind that reached down into me from above me, or at least from outside of me.I definitely felt apprehensive on this second occasion; I thought of some kind of attack, although there was no pain of any kind.The sensation in my chest was very strong.I believe, now that I look back, that this time I barely glimpsed the possibility that this might be an attempt at communication with me, from where I don't know, or that perhaps it might be a premonitory warning.I believe I thought of my aging parents, but am not sure. "</td><td>(接下来的两种感觉是在晚上稍晚的时候出现的。第二种或许是在晚上 11 点半之后，我们正坐在桌边吃东西。这种感觉是如此强烈，以至于我放下三明治，摘下眼镜，因为我真的不知道接下来会发生什么。这种感觉的浪潮非常强烈地冲刷着我。虽然周围每个人都在很大声地说话，但我却有一种声音来自内在的怪异感 觉，以无声的韵律张着嘴或哭泣。我还感觉到，或感知到，又或许是瞥见，有一个巨大的滑道或溜槽或某种通道之类的，从我的上方，或者至少是从我的身外伸进我的体内。这第二次我确实感到忐忑不安；我想到了某种症状的发作，虽然没有任何疼痛。我胸口的感觉非常强烈。现在回想起来，我相信，这次我勉强瞥见了一种可能性，那就是这可能是一种试图与我沟通的尝试，来自于我不知道的地方，也可能是一种预兆的警告。我相信我想到了我年迈的父母，但不确定。</td></tr><tr><td>(The third time, after 12:30 AM, I was standing in the doorway to our kitchen talking to Jane when I had the sensation.This time it was not as strong.Even then, I was not quick-witted enough to capitalize upon it, perhaps by asking questions aloud.I was too involved, too swept up by this feeling, to be that objective on such short notice.</td><td>(第三次，在淩晨 12:30 以后，我站在厨房门口和珍聊天时，我有了这种感觉。这次的感觉没有那么强烈。即使是这样，我也没有足够的急智去利用它，或许透 过大声地问问题。我太投入，太被这种感觉席卷，无法立刻做到那么客观。</td></tr><tr><td>(But now, the next day the memory still lingers.What was it?Maybe Seth will know.</td><td>(但现在，第二天的记忆依然挥之不去。那是什么呢？也许赛斯会知道。</td></tr><tr><td>(While writing out this statement, I am reminded that I experienced the same sensation, one time in a milder form, about a year ago.It happened on my job at Artistic Card Co. , at noon.I was alone in the art room, eating lunch at my desk, when the feeling swept over me from head to foot.There was no warning no pain, but the surprise of it doubled me over my desk.I was of course frightened momentarily, thinking of some kind of attack, but it quickly passed and did not return.I happened to be alone at the time.</td><td>(在写下这个陈述的同时，我想起了一年前，我也经历过同样的感觉，那一次形 式比较温和。那是我在艺术卡片公司工作时发生的，时间是中午。我一个人在美 术室，在办公桌前吃午饭，当这种感觉从头到脚席卷而来的时候。没有预警，也 没疼痛，但它的震惊让我趴在桌上。我当然瞬间被吓到了，以为是什么毛病发作 了，但它很快就过去了，没再发生。当时我正好是独自一个人。</td></tr><tr><td>(I remember that I stood up and paced about for a few moments.Within a short time I forgot about it, until now.I recall that in a recent session Seth said that I had called for help.I had not left my full-time job at Artistic then, but was close to doing so, and at the time I had not been feeling well.Also, when I had the experience last Saturday, I was not feeling my best.As best I can remember, I did not tell Jane of the sensation I experienced at Artistic a year ago.</td><td>(我记得我站起来踱了几步。很快我就忘了这件事，直到现在。我记得在最近的 一次课程中，赛斯说我曾呼救过。那时我还没离开我在艺术卡片公司的全职工作，但快要离职了，而且那时我一直觉得不舒服。另外，当我在上周六有这样的 经历时，我感觉不在最佳状态。在我的记忆中，我并没告诉珍一年前发生的经历。</td></tr><tr><td>(I wonder now: Had I again called for help?Was this an attempt at an answer?</td><td>(我现在想知道，我又求救了吗？这是在尝试回答吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(See page 192 for second episode.</td><td>(See page 192 for second episode.</td></tr><tr><td>(See page 275for third episode.</td><td>(See page 275for third episode.</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 24</td><td>第 24 节 心理时间,物理时间</td></tr><tr><td>FEBRUARY 10, 1964 9 PM MONDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964 年 2 月 10 日 星期一上午 9 时</td></tr><tr><td>(After supper we set out to buy a tape recorder.

and somewhat doubtful before a session, as she has explained herself, since she is the one through whom I speak.The inner senses are not accustomed to operating so freely and this upsets that all-present ego, and would seem sometimes to drive it to distraction.</td><td>(珍传述：)。我以前向你解释过这件事。正如她自己所解释的那样，她在课程 前总是略带疑惑，有些怀疑，因为我是透过她来说话。内在感官不习惯如此自由 地运作，这让那个无所不在的自我感到不安，有时似乎会让它分心。</td></tr><tr><td>(Already Jane's eyes had their dark inward look.She had begun to pace rather rapidly.Pausing before my desk, she drew her hands across the blotter

one inner sense is in strong operation, but as I mentioned in our last session, man does not trust anything which occurs to him or in him unless he is consciously aware of what he is doing, how he is doing it, and why.It bothers Ruburt, as he has said in my hearing, that oftentimes just before we begin our session formally he does not have a thought in his head.And then my excellent dissertations begin, if you will forgive a touch of egoism on my part.</td><td>通常在这些课中，只有一种内在感官在强力运作，但正如我在我们上节课提到 的，人们不相信任何发生在他身上或在他之内的事情，除非他有意识地觉察到他 正在做什么，他是如何做，以及为什么做。这困扰着鲁伯，我听他说过，很多时 候，他在我们的正式课要开始前，脑子里没有任何想法。然后我精彩的论述就开 始了，请原谅我那一丝丝的自我主义。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt wants to know where the words are coming from.He still wants to know if I am part of his subconsciousâand I must admit I do find such an idea appallingâand he wants his answers given to him in a manner which his conscious mind can understand.This is our 24th session, and I am still trying to give you the answers.</td><td>鲁伯想知道，这些话是从那里来的。他仍然想知道，我是否是他潜意识的一部分—我必须承认，我确实觉得这样的想法很可怕—他希望用他的有意识心智能够理 解的方式，得到他的答案。这是我们的第 24 节课，而我还在试着给你们这些答案。</td></tr><tr><td>It is as if I was operating on one of many channels, and I am still in the process of teaching you to operate the other dials.When you grow in proficiency, and I certainly hope you will, then much greater dimension will be given to these sessions, with your help.You are getting now something that corresponds to one thin wispy signal, or one tinny distant sound, or one clouded foggy image.In the future as I said the dimension will grow.Your own inner senses will add greater reality than you can imagine at this point.</td><td>这就好像我在许多频道中的一个频道上操作，而我还在教你们操作其他频道的拨 号过程。当你的熟练程度提高后，我当然希望你会，那么在你的帮助下，这些课 程将得到大得多的范围。你现在得到的东西，对应的是一个薄弱的信号，或者一个遥远细微的声音，或者一个云山雾罩的图像。在未来，如我所说，这个范围会 增大。你自己的内在感官会增添比你此刻所能想象的还要大的实相。</td></tr><tr><td>There is an inner sense, dear Joseph,  that in a vague manner corresponds to your own inner images.That is, you use this inner sense quite inadvertently in your visions, except that as a result of your lack of consistent training you see these but dimly.Nor can you maintain them for long.You are of course familiar with the difference between the early movies, the stills without sound, the grotesque jerky motions, and the latest Technicolor achievements, with whatever embellishments have been added.In our attempts here in these sessions you hardly know what the camera is.</td><td>有一种内在感官，亲爱的约瑟，它以一种模糊的方式与你自己的内在影像相对 应。也就是说，你在你的灵视中很不经意地使用了这种内在感官，只是由于你缺 乏一贯的训练，你看到这些却很模糊。你也不能长久地维持它们。你当然熟悉早 期电影那种，没有声音的画面，怪诞僵硬的动态，与运用了多种修饰技术的彩色 科技之间的区别。在我们这些课程的尝试中，你几乎不知道相机是什么。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true that the difference is beyond words, that is the sense apparatus that you are trying to use, is much different than the outer apparatus with which you are familiar.The inner senses however give much stronger impressions than ones given by the outer senses.When we really progress in our sessions, you will have results that are as real as the outer camouflages that you take for granted.</td><td>这里的区别，真的无法用言语表达，也就是说，你试图要使用的感知器官与你所 熟悉的外在器官，具有非常大的不同。然而内在感官比外在感官所能给予的印象 更加强烈。当我们的课程真正取得进展的时候，你会得到和你认为理所当然的外 在伪装一样真实的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>That is, you will achieve the counterpart of sight, sound, smell, touch, embellished by inner counterparts of width and existence.You have trouble now with the duration of your inner visions because you are trying to transpose them according to physical camouflage time, and this is going about it in the wrong way to begin with.As I mentioned earlier in the last session, you have at your command even now an inroad so to speak, and a relatively accessible one, in what is termed psychological time.</td><td>也就是说，你将获得视觉、听觉、嗅觉、触觉的对应物，那是由广阔和存在的内 在对应润饰过的。你现在很难维持你的内在视觉，因为你试图按照伪装的物理时 间来换位思考，这一开始就用错了方法。正如我早先在上一节课提到的，你现在 甚至可以说是有了一个进路，而且是一个相对容易的进路，就是所谓的心理时间 任你指挥。</td></tr><tr><td>This is closely related to one of the inner senses, the second inner sense, and it is upon psychological time that you must try to transpose your inner visions.You can see how handicapped we both are because of the difficulties involved in trying to make you understand inner data in terms of outer data, when the two are so apart, really, even while they are so closely connected.For instance, when I tell you that the second sense is like your sense of time, while this does give you a certain understanding or feeling of what this second sense is like, nevertheless it also is confusing, I know, because you are apt to compare the two too closely.</td><td>这与内在感官之一，即第二种内在感官密切相关，你必须在心理时间上试着置换 你的内在视觉。你看我们俩有多废啊，当试图让你根据外在资讯来理解内在资讯 时，其中所涉及到的困难，即使它们是如此的紧密相连，但两者又是如此的分 离，真的。例如，当我告诉你，第二感官就像你的时间感一样，虽然这确实能让 你对这第二感官有一定的理解或感觉，不过，我知道，这还是令人困惑，因为你 很容易将两者比较得太接近。</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps I can clarify this slightly by saying that your experience of the second inner sense will feel somewhat like your appreciation of psychological time.I will go into this further.I suggest a short break.And I will, incidentally, have something to say about your new electronic toy.</td><td>也许我这样说可以稍微澄清一下，你对第二内在感官的体验会有点像你对心理时 间的理解。我将进一步探讨这一点。我建议大家稍作休息。顺便说一下，我将对 你的新电子玩具有话要说。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26.Jane's voice had been normal during this monologue, nor did it change during the balance of the session.Her hands now felt very cool; she said that briefly they had felt heavy or fat again, but the feeling disappeared along with her nervousness.Her pacing was quite fast however when she began dictating again.Resume at 9:29.)</td><td>(9:26 休息。在这次独白中，珍的声音一直很正常，在整个课程期间也没有变化。她的手现在感觉很凉；她说，她的手曾短暂地感到沉重或肥胖，但这种感觉与她的紧张情绪一起消失了。然而，当她再次开始传述时，她的节奏相当快。9:29 恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>Now there is a point I would like to make regarding your inner visions, my dear Joseph, and also concerning any perceptions of this sort whether through pictures or any other means.</td><td>有一点我想说，就是关于你的内在视象，我亲爱的约瑟，还有关于任何这类视觉 上的感知(perceptions)，无论是通过图片还是其他方式。</td></tr><tr><td>In the first place, later we will use a different word than perception, which is somewhat misleading.</td><td>首先，我们以后会使用一个与感知(perceptions)不同的词，这个词有一定的误导 性。</td></tr><tr><td>Any such communications coming through the inner senses will exist in your psychological time.I have said also that this psychological time operates during sleep and during quiet times of consciousness.Now in dreams and in the dream framework you have the feeling of experiencing many hours, or even days.These days or hours that you seem to experience in dreams are not recorded by the physical body, and are outside of your physical time camouflage.If in a dream for example you experience within the framework two days, physically you do not age for these two days.</td><td>任何这种通过内在感官而来的交流，都会存在于你的心理时间之内。我也说过， 这个心理时间是在睡眠期间和意识的安静时刻运作的。现在在梦中和梦境架构 中，你有经历许多小时，甚至几天的感觉。你在梦中似乎经历的这些天或小时是 不被肉体记录的，是在你的物理时间伪装之外的。比如说在梦中，你在梦的架构 内经历了两天，身体上你是不会衰老两天的。</td></tr><tr><td>I am sure you see the many places that this can lead us.For one thing, psychological time is so much a part of inner reality that even though your inner self is still connected to the physical body, you are in the dream framework free of some very important physical effects.Now as your dreams seem to involve you in duration that is independent of your clock time, and I have much more to say here, so can you achieve the actual experience of duration as far as your inner visions are concerned.</td><td>我确定你能看到，这能引领我们到很多方面。首先，心理时间是内在实相如此确 切的一部分，即使你的内在自己确实是与肉体相连，但你在梦境架构内却不受一 些非常重要的身体效应的影响。你的梦似乎让你参与了独立于你钟表时间的一个 时段，我在这里还有很多话要说，就你的内在视觉而言，你也可以达成持续时间 的实际经历。</td></tr><tr><td>But the minute, the physical minute, that you try to transpose these visions upon the physical minute, then you have lost them.Many times I am sure, in so-called daydreaming, you have lost track of physical time, and before you know it the experience of inner duration has entered in.Physical time so- called, that is clock time, is one of the latest and most artificial of your camouflages.It has nothing to do with your particular plane.It is a human invention of which your animals are blissfully ignorant.</td><td>但是，当你试图把这些内在视象置换到物理分钟的那一刻，你就已经失去了这些 视象。很多时候，我相信，在所谓的白日梦中，你忘掉了物理时间，在你意识到 之前，内在持续时段的经历已经进入。所谓物理时间，也就是钟表时间，是你们 最新的、最人为的伪装之一。它与你的特定层面毫无关系。它是人类的发明，你 们的动物有幸对它一无所知。</td></tr><tr><td>In Denmark, you yourself were ignorant of this clock time.To people in earlier centuries clock time was unimportant; and from here in I will distinguish between physical time, which has to do with day and night, with the tides and seasons, and clock time with which I will deal only when absolutely necessary.</td><td>在丹麦，你们自己也对这个钟表时间一无所知。对早先几个世纪的人来说，钟表 时间并不重要；从这里开始，我将区分物理时间和钟表时间，物理时间与昼夜、 潮汐和季节有关，而钟表时间我只在绝对必要的时候才会涉及到。</td></tr><tr><td>Psychological time fits into physical time with little trouble.Originally this enabled man in many ways to live in the inner and the outer world with relative ease.Psychological time can be transposed onto physical time, but psychological time cannot flow unhampered or with any freedom through days chopped up into so many clock divisions.The clock time idea was invented by the conscious ego of man for many various reasons, with fear in the foreground.</td><td>心理时间契入物理时间毫无问题。本来这使人在许多方面能够相对轻松地生活在 内在和外在世界。心理时间可以换位到物理时间上，但心理时间却不能在被砍成那么多钟点分割的日子里，无阻碍地或自由地流动。钟表时间的概念是人的意识 自我发明的，原因有很多种，前景是恐惧。</td></tr><tr><td>At another time we will have sessions dealing with evolution, and in these sessions we will cover the advent of clock time and its many ramifications.It is without doubt one of man's tragedies, and it arose in large part out of this unpredictable dualism that befell him.</td><td>改天，我们会有几节涉及演化的课程，在这些课程中，我们将涵盖钟表时间的出 现以及它的许多影响。毫无疑问，这是人类的悲剧之一，它的产生绝大部分是源 于降临在他身上的这不可预知的二元论。</td></tr><tr><td>Physical time, or that is clock time, was invented by mans ego to protect the ego itself, because of the mistaken conception of dual existenceâthat is, because man felt that a predictable conscious self did the thinking and the moving, and an unpredictable almost automatic self did the breathing and dreaming.He set up boundaries to protect the predictable self from what he considered the unpredictable self, and ended up by cutting the whole self in half.</td><td>物理时间，或者说钟表时间，是人类的自我发明的，为了保护自我本身，因为对 二元存在的错误观念--也就是说，因为人觉得，一个可预测的有意识的自己在做 思考和运动，而一个不可预测的，几乎是自动的自己在呼吸和做梦。他为了保护 可预测的自己不受他所认为的不可预测的自己的影响而设置了界限，结果把整体 自己切成了两半。</td></tr><tr><td>Nor is the invention of clock time the only such mutilating device mistakenly invented and used to protect one part of the self from the other.You can almost trace back this fear through the legends and fantasies of the species.</td><td>钟表时间的发明也不是唯一被错误发明，用来保护一部分自己，使其不受另一部 分之害的残害器。你几乎可以从物种的传说和幻想中追溯到这种恐惧。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break, and after it we will touch upon some of the reasons for this fear which man felt, and feels, for the whole portion of his being.Because actually it is the apparent difference within himself that he fears, and he has projected this fear upon the part of himself he considered less capable of fighting back.And this, dear friends, was a big mistake, because the part of him that he denies fights back with more power than he knows.</td><td>我建议稍作休息，在休息之后，我们将触及这种恐惧的一些原因，对这些做为整 体存在的人类曾经感觉到，并且现在仍然感觉恐惧的原因。因为实际上他所害怕 的是他自己内在的明显差异，他把这种恐惧投射到他自己认为缺乏反击能力的那 部分身上。而这，亲爱的朋友们，是个大错，因为他所否定的那部分自己，反击 的力量比他所知道的还要大。</td></tr><tr><td>I'd forgotten, by all means take your break.And if I seem less humorous this evening it is only because sometimes it's so difficult to get anything through your heads, even though you help me push.</td><td>我忘了，无论如何，请你休息吧。如果今天晚上我没那么幽默，那只是因为有时 候很难通过你们的脑袋取得任何事情，尽管你帮我推了一把。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:55.Jane reports that when she pauses for Seth, during a delivery, that she can sense the whole concept of whatever subject is being discussed.It appears to hang over her, but since it is too much to handle at once, she feels Seth withdrawing it, to release it to her a little at a time in the form of connected words.</td><td>(9:55 休息。珍说，当她在传述过程中为赛斯暂停时，她能感觉到任何正在讨论的主题的整个概念。它似乎笼罩着她，但因为太多而无法立即处理，她感觉赛斯 把它们抽回去，每次只以相连字句的形式，一次释放一点给她。</td></tr><tr><td>(During break I also mentioned that I hoped Seth would discuss my sensations of last Saturday evening.I had the typewritten description on the table before me.Jane, her voice normal, resumed pacing in her stocking feet, and dictating at 10:02.

I must disentangle a concept from its pattern, which is somewhat difficult. It is somewhat like having to disentangle a particular word from a strong emotional association.I experience patterns made up of concepts, and you use words in associations.</td><td>概念以模式的方式配合在一起，我们之间才会有交流。我必须把一个概念从它的 模式中分离出来，这有些困难。这有点像要把一个特定的词从强烈的情感联想中 分离出来。我经历着由概念组成的模式，而你们是在联想中使用字句。</td></tr><tr><td>When I speak through Ruburt I must disentangle the concept from the patterns, which sometimes leaves me with short ends because it is natural for me to experience the concepts in their entirety; and yet I must drop very important data by the wayside because you are not capable of handling it, except in consecutive form.</td><td>当我通过鲁伯说话时，我必须把概念从模式中分离出来，这有时会给我很少的余 地，因为我很自然地体验它们整体的概念；可是我必须把非常重要的资料摆在一 边，因为除非以连续的形式，否则你没有能力处理它。</td></tr><tr><td>One of the advantages of the inner senses as they operate together is this ability to experience whole entirety patterns, and it is difficult to dilute this, to drop it so to speak, drop by drop.I would like to say something about Joseph's experience the other evening, but I also want to go into the invention of the soul.</td><td>内在感官共同运作的优势之一，就是这种体验整个整体模式的能力，很难稀释这 种能力，可以说是用一滴一滴的方式去稀释它。我想说一些关于约瑟那天晚上的 经历，但我也想谈谈灵魂的发明。</td></tr><tr><td>You see, to me these things are closely associated and connected in an overall concept pattern, and yet I must give them to you one at a time, and take pages to make the connection clear.One of mankind's weaknesses has always been his impatience and his preoccupation with camouflage patterns on his plane.It is this impatience that made him attempt to know himself by examining the outside world, rather than exploring what was within himself.</td><td>你看，对我来说，这些东西在一个整体的概念模式中是紧密联系的，是相通的， 然而我必须一次只给你们一个，而且要用几页纸才能把这关联说清楚。人类的一 个弱点一直是他的没耐性和对他层面上伪装模式的全神贯注。正是这种不耐烦， 使他试图通过审视外在世界来认识自己，而不是探索自己的内在。</td></tr><tr><td>There is so much to tell you I can really only hit the high spots a good deal of the time.However as I told you, and as even your Malba spoke the truth for once, this will be for you and Ruburt a lifetime experience.And so we do have the time, even the physical time, so that all the material will be covered.</td><td>要告诉你的东西太多了，大部分的时候，我真的只能给出几个亮点。然而正如我 告诉你的，甚至你的马尔巴有次也说了实话，这将是你和鲁伯一生的经历。所以 我们确实有时间，即使是物理时间，这样所有的资料都会被涵盖到。</td></tr><tr><td>In prehistoric times mankind evolved the ego and self-consciousness to help him deal with the camouflage patterns that he had created.This is no contradiction, and will be explained later.He did the job so well that even when he had things under control he was not satisfied.He developed at a lopsided level.He used himself as a tool to dissect himself.The inside senses led him to a reality he could not manipulate as easily as he could a camouflage world, and he feared what he thought of as a loss of mastery.</td><td>在史前时代，人类演化出了自我和自身意识，以帮助他应对自己创造的伪装模 式。这并不矛盾，后面会解释。他的工作做得很好，即使事情都已在控制中，他 仍不满意。他的发展水平是一边倒的。他把自己当成了解剖自己的工具。内在的 感觉使他进入了一个他无法像伪装世界那样轻易操纵的实相，他害怕自己会失去 他自己认为的主控权。</td></tr><tr><td>The soul fantasy, or spirit fantasy, arose at about this time, and has been a disadvantage to him because it gives a name and a designation to one part of the whole self, setting it up against the other part.It is this basic conception, however, that also forced him to face one truth despite himselfâthat of continued existence, to which he gave the word immortality.</td><td>灵魂[soul]的幻想或灵[spirit]的幻想，大约是在这个时候产生的，对他来说一直是一个不利的因素，因为它给整体自己的一部分起了一个名字和称号，把它与另一 部分对立起来。然而，正是这种基本概念，也迫使他不顾自己去面对一个事实— 持续存在的事实，他给这个事实冠以不朽一词。</td></tr><tr><td>This conception is to blame for the superstitious attitudes, however, concerning the inner world as a whole, and some of mans misconceptions have been ludicrous and pathetic.I think now mainly of his giving the immaterial inner self a dwelling place formed of physical camouflage patterns. In other words, a physical heaven and hell.</td><td>然而，这种概念要归咎于关于整个内在世界的迷信态度，人类的一些错误概念是 可笑而可悲的。我现在主要想到的是，他给非物质的内在自己一个由物质伪装模 式构成的住处。换句话说，就是一个物质的天堂和地狱。</td></tr><tr><td>I will leave this subject and go into your experience the other evening, even though there is so much more here that needs to be said.The trouble is, you have to clear away so many misconceptions to get at some of the truths behind them.The spirit is no less real because man has clothed it in such foolishness.</td><td>我就不谈这个话题了，就说说你那天晚上的经历吧，尽管这里还有很多东西需要 说。麻烦的是，你必须清除掉那么多的误解，才能了解到背后的一些真相。虽然 人类给它披上了如此愚蠢的外衣，但灵[Spirit]依然同样的真实。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest again a brief break, but mark my words:We will go into this material tong and hammer some night, and let the sparks fall where they may.</td><td>我再次建议休息一下，但是请记住我的话。我们将在某个夜晚狠狠地推敲这份资 料，任火花随其散落。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:25.During break we discussed Seth's apparent ability to go through the whole books of his notes that we have taken, two volumes to date, without the necessity to do it in consecutive order, turn pages, etc.I used the word "see" to describe this process.Jane resumed dictating at 10:30. )"</td><td>(10:25 休息。在休息期间，我们讨论了赛斯的明显能力，他的笔记，到目前为止，我们已经记录了整整两卷，没有必要做连续的顺序，翻页，等等。我用 "看"这个词来形容这个过程。10:30 分珍恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>Dear Joseph, apropos of your remarks during your break:I feel concept patterns, or at least that is the nearest I can come to explaining it to you, and this my dear friend will involve our third inner sense when we really go into that discussion.It involves a different idea entirely from the first inner sense, which somewhat corresponds on a different level to your empathy.There is a subtle distinction between the two senses that sets them apart.</td><td>亲爱的约瑟，关于你在休息期间的谈话，贴切地说:我感觉到了概念模式， 或者至少这是我能给你的最接近的解释， 我亲爱的朋友，这将涉及到我们的第三种内在感官， 当我们真正进入讨论的时候。它涉及到与第一种内在感官完全不同的观念，在不同的层面上，有点对应于你们的同理心。这两种感官之间存在着细 微的区别，这使它们区别开来。</td></tr><tr><td>I wanted to say a little more about duration, as far as communication from the inner senses are concerned.As I said, duration can be experienced in relation to psychological time and within its framework.The important thing here, and I'm afraid the difficult thing for you here, is the relaxation of the mind from clock time.And this is a freedom which you can and should allow yourself in such instances.</td><td>就内在感官的沟通交流而言，我想多说一点关于持续性时间。正如我所说的，持 续时间可以与心理时间有关的方面，以及其架构内被经历。这里重要的事情，恐 怕也是你们的难点，是心智可以从钟表时间中放松开来。这是在这种情况下，你 可以，也应该允许自己的一种自由。</td></tr><tr><td>It comes, believe it or not, quite naturally, and if you relax you will be aware of it in quiet moments.</td><td>信不信由你，它来得很自然，如果你放松，你会在安静的时刻意识到它。</td></tr><tr><td>(I had been having some back trouble.A spasm seized me now, so much so that I had to quit writing.)</td><td>(我的背部一直有问题，现在一阵痉挛，强烈到我不得不停止书写。)</td></tr><tr><td>You had better stand up for a moment and move around.That is what you are supposed to do in these frequent breaks from the material.There is no reason why you cannot stand.There are articles of furniture upon which you can rest your pad.Surely I should not have to remind you of the practicality of camouflage patterns, with which I am no longer concerned.If I were as dependent upon them as you are, I would use them better.Indeed, I did when I was.Please do get comfortable.</td><td>你最好站起来活动一下，这是你在多次的休息中应该做的。有一些家具可以让你把你的笔记本放在上面。你没有理由不站起 来。当然，我不必提醒你那些我如 今不再关心的伪装模式的实用性。如果我像你一样依赖它们，我会更善于利用它 们。事实上，我以前就是这样。请让自己舒服一点。</td></tr><tr><td>(I took my pad over to our high, old-fashioned TV set.It made a good desk.I stood up to take Jane's dictation for the rest of the session. )"</td><td>(我把笔记本拿到我们高高的老式电视机上。这成了一张不错的桌子。在这节剩

through effects, with the abilities of the whole self, of which it is but a part.</td><td>催眠对你的身体，甚至精神状况都会很有帮助。催眠毕竟只是一种触及整体自 己，以及透过各种效果，使自我认识到整体自己一部分能力的方法。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane had hypnotized me twice recently.The sessions had been very beneficial, giving me several days of freedom from pain after each session.)</td><td>(珍最近帮我做了两次催眠。这些疗程对我非常有益，每次疗程后都让我有好几 天可以免于疼痛。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now if you are ready I will say a few words about your beautiful, if haphazard, experience with the inner senses the other evening.</td><td>现在，如果你准备好了，我会说几句关于你那天晚上与内在感官的美丽的，又或 许是偶然的经历。</td></tr><tr><td>The circumstances at your end just happened to be right for something like this to occur.It was like a sudden opening of a door.You didn't know how to open it any further, and if I may say so, you didn't even know how to close it.And yet you would not even have admitted the experience consciously not too long ago, as something like it occurred at an earlier date and consciously you forgot it.</td><td>你那头的环境刚好适合这样的事情发生。就像一扇突然打开的门。你不知道如何 进一步打开它，如果我可以这样说，你甚至不知道如何关上它。然而就在不久 前，你甚至不承认曾经有过这种经历，因为类似的事情发生在更早的时候，而你 却有意识地忘记了它。</td></tr><tr><td>The first time this happened you were calling for help.Like most of the human race you feared the inner world so strongly, even though you were somewhat acquainted with it through your art, that nothing but panic would ever force you to try that invisible knob.</td><td>第一次发生这种事的时候，你是在呼救。和大多数人类一样，你对内在世界的恐 惧非常强烈，尽管你通过艺术对它有一定的了解，但除了惊慌失措之外，没有任 何能迫使你去试试那个看不见的门钮。</td></tr><tr><td>This time however there was a remembrance of panic, but that is all.Actually you opened the door out of desire, stimulated by our sessions and out of curiosity, but you were still scared to death.</td><td>然而这次却有对恐慌的记忆，但也仅此而已。其实你是出于欲望，加上我们这些 课的刺激，还有出于好奇心，你打开了那扇门，但你还是被吓得要死。</td></tr><tr><td>What you experienced is difficult to explain until we have a thorough discussion of the inner senses, however I will give you a somewhat superficial explanation for now.What you experienced was an onrush, or should I say onslaught, of data in its pure form, rushing through the inner senses like a wind in kaleidoscope, because you did not know how to control or disentangle the data.</td><td>你所经历的事情很难解释，除非我们彻底地讨论了内在感官，不过我现在先给你 一个粗浅的解释。你所经历的是一种纯粹形式的资讯的涌入，或者我应该说是冲 击，就像万花筒里的风一样冲过内在感官，因为你不知道如何控制或解开这些资 讯。</td></tr><tr><td>For this reason you attempted a rather hilarious feat.You tried to switch over and pick up inside data with the outside senses, and then project this inward.For a beginner it was quite a performance.You were attempting the impossible, and I will go into this also more thoroughly at a later time when you can understand the explanation a little better.</td><td>为此，你尝试了一个相当滑稽的壮举。你试着切换，用外在的感官接收内在资讯，然后将这些资讯向内投射。对于一个初学者来说，这是一个相当不错的表 现。你在尝试不可能的事，以后等你能更理解这些解释时，我再更彻底地探讨这 一点。</td></tr><tr><td>It was a defect on the receiving end that caused fear on your part.I will say this next sentence, and sometime later it will become more clear.You felt sound.This was faithful to the inner senses.But because you did not hear sound with your ears, you panicked and formed the image of mouths that could not speak.This was a projection of your inability and should not be taken as any condition of helplessness existing in the inner world, as I am afraid you interpreted the image.</td><td>这是接收端的缺陷，造成了你的恐惧。我接下来说的这句话，以后某个时候会更 清楚。你感觉到了声音。这是忠于内在感官的感觉。但因为你不是用耳朵听到声 音，你就慌了，形成了口不能言的形象。这是你能力不足的一个投射，不应该被 认为是存在于内在世界的任何无助的状况，恐怕你是这样解释这个形象的。</td></tr><tr><td>Your feeling of a door or funnel is quite legitimate, however, and if you felt attacked because of the onrush of data that seemed to crash down upon you, it was only because of your lack of ability to control the volume, so to speak; although in this case such an imaginary knob would control much more.</td><td>然而，你对门或漏斗的感觉是相当合理的，如果你因为资讯的涌入而感到被攻 击，似乎是向你撞来，那只是因为你缺乏控制音量的能力，可以这么说；虽然在 这种情况下，这样一个假想的门钮可以更好的控制。</td></tr><tr><td>You switched yourself off automatically because the experience frightened you, but the whole affair was beneficial because it gave you some first-hand experience of pure inner sensory data.It was unfortunate that it was so uncontrolled, but I'm afraid this is to be expected in the beginning.If possible try to relax if this occurs again, and the data will slow itself up.</td><td>你自动关闭了自己，因为这个经历吓到了你，但整个事件是有益的，因为它给了 你一些纯粹的内在感官资讯的亲身体验。很不幸，它如此不受控制，但这恐怕是 一开始就可以预料到的。如果再出现这种情况，可能的话，请试着放松，资讯会 自己慢下来。</td></tr><tr><td>("Is there anything I can do to encourage such a flow of data again?")</td><td>("我有什么办法可以再次鼓励这样的资讯流吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>At this stage you will do what you can to encourage it without my telling you, yourself, as you yourself initiated the event to begin with.Your own innate inner knowledge will aid you, and any intellectual comprehension at this time would not help; later it may.</td><td>在这个阶段，你会尽你所能地去鼓励它，无需我告诉你，你自己，因为你自己起 动了这个事件的开端。你自己与生具来的内在知识会帮助你，此时任何智性方面 的理解都无济于事，以后可能会有帮助。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break.And this time my dear Joseph, do copy your strolling wife and move about.</td><td>我建议短暂的休息一下。这一次，我亲爱的约瑟，要学着你那漫步的妻子，走动 一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:01.Seth's material had reminded Jane that several times in the past she'd had the experience of hearing music when none was to he heardâthat is, no radios were playing within range, etc.Jane has very acute hearing, but was still sure the music came from within.And usually she would realize that it had been "playing" for some time as she went about her duties before she became aware of it consciously.Jane resumed at 11:07.)</td><td>(11:01 休息。赛斯的资料提醒了珍，过去有好几次，她有过在没有音乐的情况下听到音乐的经历—也就是说，在听力范围内没有收音机在播放，等等。珍的听 觉非常敏锐，但还是确信音乐来自内在。而且通常她会意识到，在她履行职责的时候，它已经 "播放 "了一段时间，然后她才会有意识地觉察到这一点。珍在11:07 继续)。</td></tr><tr><td>This is going to be a rather brief session comparatively.One note I wanted to make:As I have said, psychological time is a natural connective to the inner world.Though you experience days or hours within the framework of psychological time during the dream state, and yet do not age for a comparable amount of physical time, so as you develop in your use of psychological time you will be able to rest and be refreshed within the framework of psychological time while you are consciously awake.This will aid your mental and physical state to an amazing degree, and you will discover added vitality on the one hand, and a somewhat decreased need to sleep on the other.</td><td>这将是一次比较简短的课程。我想做一个说明。正如我所说，心理时间是进入内 在世界的自然连接点。虽然在梦境中，你在心理时间的架构内经历了数天或数小 时，但物理时间却不会有等量时间的老化，所以随着你对心理时间使用的发展， 你将能够在意识清醒的时候，在心理时间的架构内得到休息，并精神焕发。这将对你的精神和身体状态有惊人的帮助，你会发现一方面增加了活力，另一方面睡 眠的需求也有所降低。</td></tr><tr><td>Within any given five minutes of clock time, for example, you may find an hour of resting which is independent of clock time.I wanted to make this point earlier.</td><td>例如，在任何 5  分钟的钟表时间内，你可能会有一个小时的休息，而这与钟表时间无关。我想早点说明这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>"Ruburt's forgotten-till-now experience with music was legitimate.Actually it reoccurred many times, I believe, and was always discarded by the conscious mind.Again, this involves feeling sound.That is all I will say for the moment, but it is a valuable foretaste. "</td><td>鲁伯直到现在才想起的音乐的经历是真的。其实我相信，它重复出现了很多次， 而且总是被意识心丢弃。这又涉及到对声音的感觉。我暂时就说这么多，但这是 一个宝贵的预示。</td></tr><tr><td>When you grow tired or exhausted, one of the reasons for this is your inability to use even the simple psychological time to your own advantage.Remember this.I wish you good luck with your new thingamajig.If it is going to record my voice, then I wish it luck.Perhaps I shall play tricks on it. Perhaps I shall play tricks on you.</td><td>当你变得疲惫或筋疲力尽时，其中一个原因是，你无能力利用哪怕是简单的心理 时间以利于自己。请记住这一点。祝你用那叫什么来着的东西好运。如果它能录 下我的声音，那我祝它好运。也许我应该对它玩点花招，也许我会在你身上玩点 把戏</td></tr><tr><td>Incidentally again, hypnosis also helps you to use psychological time to a true advantage.The boundaries of clock time melt when psychological time is utilized.You can look through psychological time at clock time, and even use clock time to your advantage; but without the initial recognition of psychological time, then clock time is somewhat of a prison.</td><td>再顺便说一句，催眠还可以帮助你利用心理时间得到真正的好处。利用心理时 间，钟表时间的界限就消融了。你可以透过心理时间看钟表时间，甚至可以使用 钟表时间来对你有利；但如果没有对心理时间的初步认可，那么钟表时间就有点 像监狱。</td></tr><tr><td>Your physical time of seasons and tides, and night and day, is to me one of your most delightful camouflages, and if Ruburt will excuse my clumsy attempt at being poetical, I will say that physical time is like a delightful flowing gown that clothes psychological time with many different colors and materials and designs.It is a most faithful reproduction of psychological time, and one of your truest camouflages.</td><td>你们的四季和潮汐、黑夜和白天的物理时间，对我来说是你们最令人愉快的伪装 之一，如果鲁伯原谅我笨拙的诗意尝试，我会说，物理时间就像罩在心理时间上 的一件飘逸的晚礼服，有许多不同的颜色、材料和设计，令人赏心悦目。它是心 理时间最忠实的复制，也是你们最真实的伪装之一。</td></tr><tr><td>This is why psychological time seems to flow so easily when physical time is pursued and watched by a quiet "I".The one leads to the other and the camouflage is loose enough to let the inner form shine through.A proper use of psychological time will not only lead you into the inner world, but will also prevent you from being rushed in the physical world.Within it, that is within the framework of psychological time, you will discover a quiet and cool peacefulness.I tell you both this for your benefit, because both of you will gain much in the utilization of these added benefits.</td><td>这是为什么当物理时间被一个安静的 "我 "所追寻和注视时，心理时间似乎很容易流动。一个导致另一个，当伪装足够松动，内在形式就能闪耀登场。适当的利 用心理时间，不仅能引领你进入内在世界，还能避免你在物质世界中匆匆忙忙。在其中，也就是在心理时间的架构内，你会发现一种宁静和清凉的祥和。我把这 些告诉你们，是为了让你们能受益，利用这些附加的益处，你们都会收获良多。</td></tr><tr><td>Psychological time adds duration.You will find something else here.From the framework of psychological time you will see that clock time is as dreamlike and fleeting as you once thought inner time was.And you will discover that inner time is as much a reality as you once thought outer time was.You will discover your whole selves in other worlds, peeping inward and outward at the same time, and finding that all time is one time, and that all divisions are illusion.</td><td>心理时间会增加时段的持续时间。你会在这里发现别的东西。从心理时间的架构 中，你会看到钟表时间和你曾经认为的心理时间一样，是如梦似幻，转瞬即逝 的。而你也会发现，心理时间和你曾经认为的外在时间一样，都是一种实相。你会发现你在其他世界的整体自己，同时向内和向外窥视，发现所有的时间都是一 个时间，所有的划分都是幻象。</td></tr><tr><td>"You may take a break or you may end the session.And don't say I haven't led you on a merry chase tonight, for when you reread the material you will see that I have.I cannot stress too strongly the benefits you will receive by using psychological time as I have told you.You know now what it is and how to use it to advantage.Not only will it help the physical and mental being on your plane, but it will enable you to meet the whole self. "</td><td>你可以休息一下，或者结束课程。不要说我今晚没有带领你们快乐地追逐，当你 们重读资料时，你们会发现我有。我再怎么强调使用心理时间的好处都不为过， 如我已经告诉过你的。你现在知道了它是什么，也知道了如何利用它来受益。它 不仅在你们层面有助于身体和精神上的存在，而且也将使你能够遇见整体自己。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:30.Jane's voice had been normal, and her pacing slowed to its usual rate.Since we were both tired now we had little thought of continuing.Jane resumed at 11:35.)</td><td>(11:30 休息。珍的声音一直很正常，她的步伐也放慢到平时的速度。由于我们现在都很累，所以都不想继续下去。11:35 分，珍又开始了。)</td></tr><tr><td>Since you both are tiring I will end this session.The one point I would like to make, first, is this:Conscious fear is usually the main hindrance as far as data from the inner senses is concerned.Therefore, a realization that these senses belong to you and are quite natural will help you avoid the otherwise unavoidable, almost automatic closing off of such data by the consciousness.</td><td>既然你们都累了，我就结束这节课。首先，我想说的一点是。就来自内在感官的 资讯而言，意识上的恐惧通常是主要的障碍。因此，认识到这些感官本属于你， 而且是相当自然的，将能帮助你避免这些资讯被意识原本不可避免地自动关闭掉。</td></tr><tr><td>If you will remember this, inner data will come through much more easily, and you will be able to control it.It is never of itself overpowering.There are abilities in which you can train yourself, in both recognition of data when it occurs, utilization, and control.This also implies to some degree utilization as far as duration is concerned.That is, within the framework of psychological time you can lengthen such experiences.</td><td>如果你能记住这一点，内在资讯就会更容易通过来，你也会有能力去掌控它。它 本身决不是压倒性的。有一些能力你可以训练自己，像在资讯发生时的识别、利 用和掌控方面。这也意味着就持续时间而言，做某种程度上的利用。也就是说， 在心理时间的架构内，你可以延长这种体验。</td></tr><tr><td>You can never force them to exist for a specified period of clock time, nor for that matter can you do that to a dream.Though this may sound impossible at this stage, nevertheless you can control such data when in a waking state better than you can control a dream.Here you learn to use certain parts of the consciousness for the purposes of the whole self, but I will discuss this at a later date.</td><td>你永远无法强迫它们存在于一段特定的钟表时间内，同样的，对梦境也一样做不 到。虽然这在现阶段听起来不可能，不过，比起掌控利用梦境资讯，你在醒时的 状态，更能识别和掌控来自内在的资讯。这里，为了整体自己的目的，你要学着 使用意识的某些部分，但这件事我以后再讨论。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane said that was all from Seth.I said good night aloud.We sat at the board and indicated good night with the pointer.</td><td>(珍说，这全都来自于赛斯。我大声说晚安。我们坐在显灵板前，用指针表示晚 安。</td></tr><tr><td>(Gratis)</td><td>(自动回答)</td></tr><tr><td>Good night, good-bye, yes.</td><td>晚安，再见，是的。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 11:45.  )</td><td>(11:45 结束)。</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 25</td><td>第 25 节 种族记忆</td></tr><tr><td>FEBRUARY 12, 1964 9 PM WEDNESDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964 年 2 月 12 日，星期三晚上 9 点，按指示</td></tr><tr><td>(This was our first attempt at recording Jane's voice during a session.We knew little about operating the recorder yet, although the night before Jane had successfully recorded a hypnosis session in which she had helped me with my back trouble.

"</td><td>我想说说灵魂的发明，用人类自己的术语，灵魂和灵[Spirit]被认为是同一个东 西。我们所谈到的二元性主要是人为的。在所谓的先进社会中，它的作用更强。</td></tr><tr><td>Studies will show that this duality is not a natural state of man, since even today many so-called primitive societies do not experience this duality to anything like the degree with which it affects more civilized communities.This alone should be proof that the condition is not a prerequisite for the species as such.Instead, and to the contrary, this sense of duality besieges man as he becomes more inventive in a purely mechanical fashion.</td><td>研究将表明，这种二元性并不是人的自然状态，因为即使在今天，许多所谓的原 始社会也没有经历过这种二元性，而这种二元性对文明社会的影响程度也不尽相 同。仅此一点就应该证明，这种状况不是物种本身的先决条件。反而，恰恰相 反，当人类以一种纯粹机械的方式变得更有发明力时，这种二元性意识就围困了 人类。</td></tr><tr><td>(By now Jane was pacing around the room at a fast rate, back and forth past the recorder.Her eyes had darkened.She displayed practically no voice or hand phenomena during the session.)</td><td>(现在，珍在房间里快速地踱步，来回走过录音机。她的眼睛变黑了。录音过程 中，她几乎没有表现出任何声音或手部现象。)</td></tr><tr><td>Nor is there anything wrong in inventiveness itself.Manipulation of camouflage patterns is to be expected, and furthermore is desirable.However, many native societies appreciate the fact of camouflage patterns, and retain the ability to separate the whole self from camouflage.</td><td>创造性本身并没有任何问题。对伪装模式的操纵是可以预期的，而且是可取的。然而，许多土著社会充分了解伪装模式的事实，并保留了将整体自己与伪装分开 的能力。</td></tr><tr><td>When I speak of the whole self I am of course referring to the personality as it exists in its entirety, having at its command use of both the inner and outer senses.That is, I speak of the doer, the mover, the breather and the dreamer as all belonging to one whole self.</td><td>当我说到整体的自己时，我当然是指它完整存在的人格，在它的指挥下使用内在 和外在的感官。也就是说，我所说的做事者、行动者、呼吸者和做梦者都属于一 个整体的自己。</td></tr><tr><td>This designation does not include the entity as a whole, however.The personality does have access to the entity, but the personality does not contain the entity.In other words the whole self as it exists on your plane does not contain the entity, although communication between the entity and the whole self can and does take place by means of the inner senses.</td><td>但是，这种称呼并不包括做为整体的存有。人格确实可以接触到存有，但人格并 不包含存有。换句话说，在你的层面上存在的整体自己并不包含存有，尽管存有 和整体自己之间的沟通可以而且确实通过内在感官的方式进行。</td></tr><tr><td>In many primitive communities, these communications are accepted as reality.In your civilization as a whole, they are not.I know that you will tell me, my dear Joseph, when your hand is tired, and we will break.</td><td>在许多原始社区，这些沟通被接受为现实。在你们的整个文明中，它们不是。我 知道，你会告诉我，我亲爱的约瑟，当你的手累了，我们就休息。</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes.")</td><td>("好的"。)</td></tr><tr><td>Much investigation along the lines of so-called ESP is being carried on in the Western world.The fact is that Western man has not only cut himself off from half of his own ability, and half of his own knowledge because of his insistence upon an artificial dual nature, but he has also cut himself off from the very primitive societies from which he could learn very much about these abilities, which he himself refuses to admit.</td><td>西方世界沿着所谓超感官知觉的思路进行了很多调查。事实上，西方人因为坚持 人为的双重性，不仅切断了自己一半的能力，一半的知识，而且还切断了自己与非常原始的社会的联系，他原本可以从这些社会学到很多关于这类的能力，这些 他自己不承认的能力。</td></tr><tr><td>"His education, his everyday pattern of existence, his cultural values, tend to imprison him so that he can only view other societies through the murky haze of his own misconceptions.If he considers a native in Africa, for example, as a superstitious rather imbecilic, almost prehistoric creature from the past, then he will learn nothing of that man's ability.He will ridicule any such evidence of so- called ESP on the native's part as further proof of the Africans childlike mind. "</td><td>他所受的教育，他的日常生存模式，他的文化价值观，往往禁锢着他，使他只能 透过自己误解的迷雾来看待其他社会。例如，如果他认为非洲的一个土著是一个 迷信的、相当低能的、几乎像是来自过去的史前生物，那么他将不会了解那个人 的能力。他会嘲笑任何在土著身上的所谓超感官知觉的证据，并拿来作为非洲土 人幼稚心智的进一步证明。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not going to go into this particular matter to any great degree.There is certainly much to be said for Western man.However it is usually said by others, very eloquently, and nothing is said about the abilities of less civilized so-to- speak societies.</td><td>我不打算在这个特定的问题上做任何程度的探讨。西方人当然有许多值得一提的 地方。然而这通常是别人说的，而且滔滔不绝，而对所谓文明程度较低的社会的 那些能力却只字不提。</td></tr><tr><td>The fact remains that psychologists or scientists cannot really speak of so- called ESP as either below normal or above normal as far as the species is concerned, just because Western man finds such difficulty in using it with any effectiveness.Other peoples manage to use it in a rather effective manner.</td><td>事实依然是，就物种而言，心理学家或科学家们也不敢说所谓的超感官知觉是低 于正常或超乎正常，只是因为西方人发现在使用它时很难有任何效果。其他民族 的人却能相当有效地使用它。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take a break, and then I will have a few more remarks on the subject.</td><td>我建议你先休息一下，然后我再对这个问题发表一些看法。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27.I announced the time aloud, we made a few comments on how the session was going, then Jane shut off the recorder.She was not nervous by now, as usual.We had the machine set to record at the slowest speed possible, in order to make the tape last.When Jane felt Seth coming on again, she turned on the recorder, I announced the time, and Jane began to dictate once more. Resume at 9:31.)</td><td>(9:27 休息。我大声说出了时间，我们对课程的进行情况做了一些评论，然后珍关掉了录音机。她现在已经不紧张了，和往常一样。我们把机器设到最慢的速度录音，以使磁带能录制更长时间。当珍感觉到赛斯又来了，她打开录音机，我宣布时间，9:31 珍又开始传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>The trouble is in ESP investigations, that you are using the wrong tools again.You are taking this dual self for granted again.Until you realize that there is one self, and not one self who does and manipulates and another self who breathes and dreams, you will get nowhere quickly.Investigations carried on according to what is considered scientific precepts are doomed in a large measure to slow-motion tactics at best, and to complete failure at worst.</td><td>问题是在对超感官知觉的调查研究中，你们又一次使用了错误的工具。你们再次 把这个双重自己视为理所当然。除非你们意识到只有一个自己，而不是一个执行 和操纵的自己，和另一个呼吸和做梦的自己，否则你们很快就会一无所获。按照 被认为是科学的规范进行的调查，在很大程度上注定了充其量只是慢热的策略， 而在最坏的情况下则是彻底失败。</td></tr><tr><td>This does not mean that evidence cannot be found, and overwhelming evidence, for the existence of the inner senses.It does mean that spontaneity must be allowed for.It is extremely difficult to relate data received by the inner senses into data that will be picked up by the outer senses.</td><td>这并不意味着不能找到证据，而且是压倒性的证据，证明内在感官的存在。这确 实意味着必须允许自发性。要把内在感官接收到的资讯与外在感官获得的资讯对 应起来，是极其困难的。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, at best you get something like a mirror image which must be deciphered.This is rather difficult to get across to you.However, data received by the inner senses will have its own discernible impact upon the personality receiving it, and this impact is as strong as any impact caused by camouflage stimuli.</td><td>同样，你最多只能得到一些类似镜像的东西，而这些镜像必须被解码。这对你来 说是相当困难的。然而，内在感官接收到的资讯会对接收资讯的人格产生自己可 辨识的影响，这种影响与伪装刺激造成的任何影响一样强大。</td></tr><tr><td>The fact is that when you insist upon evidence through the outside, regularly accepted senses, that you almost automatically turn off the inner sense apparatus.This is not necessary.Man to a large degree has set up this habit reaction.It is not a natural habit reaction.You must take the inner data at its face value, and this is what you will not do.Once you take this first step of spontaneity, you will actually receive evidence that even your conscious mind will be forced to accept.But the first step of such willingness must be made.</td><td>事实是，当你坚持透过外在的、一般接受的感官来获取证据时，那你几乎自动关 闭了内在感官的配备。这是没有必要的。人类在很大程度上设置了这种习惯反应。这不是一种自然的习惯反应。你必须对内在资讯照单全收，但你不会这么 做。一旦你迈出了这自发性的第一步，你实际上就会收到连你的显意识心智都不 得不接受的证据。但是，必须先迈出这心甘情愿的第一步。</td></tr><tr><td>If you once allow yourself to freely receive inner data in a spontaneous noncritical manner, you will see that this data is as legitimate, valid and varied, and as powerful as any outside stimuli.But to insist upon translating this data into channels that can first be picked up by the outer senses, and then expecting undistorted strong data, is asking the impossible.</td><td>一旦你允许自己以一种自发的、非批判性的方式，自由地接收内在资讯，你就会 看到，这种资讯和任何外在刺激一样合理、有效、多样和强大。但是，如果坚持 把这些资讯转化为首先能被外在感官接收到的频道，然后期望收到不失真的强大 资讯，那是在要求不可能的事。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, the impressions received by the inner senses are actually concrete in a way that you do not yet understand.This data also has physical effects upon the brain.In the same manner that impressions received from outside stimuli affect the brain, they make their impression upon it.They change the personality as any experience changes a personality.To insist upon evidence in terms of outside sensual data is as ridiculous a notion as to expect a camera to play music.</td><td>同样，内在感官所接收到的印象，实际上是具体确定的，只是以一种你还不了解 的方式呈现。这些资讯也会对大脑产生物理影响。就像从外界刺激中接收到的印 象影响头脑一样，它们也会给头脑留下印象。它们会改变人格，就像任何经历都 会改变人格一样。坚持用外在的感官资讯作为证据，就像期待相机能播放音乐一 样，是荒谬的想法。</td></tr><tr><td>Music exists and can be played on a phonograph.Sights can be captured by camera.But you do not expect music to come from a camera. You do not expect a phonograph to take pictures, yet while you are listening to music from a phonograph this does not mean, even to you, that cameras do not record sight.You are expecting the outer senses to do something they are not capable of doing, of receiving or performing in a way that is alien to them.You are expecting them to act like a camera that can pick up music, and because the camera does not pick up music you are saying that music does not exist.</td><td>音乐存在，可以用留声机播放。景观可以被相机拍下来。但你并不期望音乐能从 相机中传出，你也不期望留声机能拍照，然而当你听着留声机里的音乐时，这并 不意味着，甚至对你来说，相机不能记录景观。你在期待外在的感官做一些它们 没有能力做的事情，以一种对它们来说颇为陌生的方式接收或执行。你期待它们 的行为就像一台能收到音乐的照相机，而因为照相机无法收到音乐，你就说音乐 不存在。</td></tr><tr><td>At the same time, using the rather weak analogy of music as compared to inner data, you are refusing to use the phonograph.That is, you are refusing to use the very inner senses which are equipped to handle the data that you wish to capture.</td><td>同时，用音乐这个相当弱的比喻与内在资讯相类比，你是在拒绝使用留声机。也 就是说，你是在拒绝使用内在的感官，而内在的感官是有能力处理你想获取的资 讯的。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true that as a whole you do not as yet understand the inner senses intellectually.The part of yourself which you deny understands the inner senses well.But this does you no good at this stage of the game and so you are in the peculiar position, once more, of trying to dissect the inner world with camouflage tools.</td><td>诚然，作为一个整体，你还没有在智力上理解内在感官。你所否定的那部分自己 很了解内在感官。但这对你现阶段的游戏没有任何好处，所以你再度处于一个奇 特的立场，你试图用伪装工具来剖析内在世界。</td></tr><tr><td>It is your refusal to accept the whole self that causes the difficulty.Once more:Data received by the inner senses is as vivid, and in fact more vivid, than any other data you will ever receive, and the ironic part of the whole matter is that you actually receive this inner data constantly. You utilize it constantly and yet consciously you will not accept its existence.</td><td>正是由于你拒绝接受整体自己，才会有这个困难。再说一次。内在感官接收到的 资讯是一样鲜活生动的，事实上，比你将收到的任何其他资讯都更鲜活生动，而 整个事情的可笑处是，实际上，你不断地接收这些内在资讯，你不断地使用它， 然而在意识上，你不接受它的存在。</td></tr><tr><td>The very fact that you breathe and dream and perform countless other activities without any aid from the conscious ego should of itself convince even the most stubborn scientific skull that more is involved than science is willing to admit.The idea of the subconscious mind is merely a grudging, hedging, partial admission that man is more than the conscious ego, more than the sum of his parts, and more than a mechanism.</td><td>你呼吸、做梦，以及在没有任何意识自我帮助的情况下进行无数的其他活动，这 一事实本身就应该让最顽固的科学脑壳相信，其中涉及的东西比科学愿意承认的 还要多。对潜意识心智的概念仅仅是一种勉强的、对峙的、部分的承认，即人不 仅只是有意识的自我，人比他各部分的总和还要多，人不只是一个机制。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take a brief break, and I hope you get all your pieces back together again, my two Humpty Dumpty.</td><td>我建议你稍作休息，希望你重新把所有的碎片拼凑起来，我的两个矮胖子(Humpty Dumpty)。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:00.Before turning off the recorder Jane spoke into it, saying that if I could, write faster she could talk faster.In regard to her fast pacing, she said it was no effort at all, that she felt as though she could "take off." Nor does she have any idea "of what I am going to say next, or anything. "</td><td>(10 点休息。关掉录音机之前，珍对著录音机说，如果我可以写得快一点，她就可以说得快一点。对于她的快节奏，她说根本不费力，她觉得自己可以 "起飞"。她也完全不知道"我接下来要说什么"。</td></tr><tr><td>(During break Jane had to flip the reel on the recorder because the tape was almost used up.This took a few minutes.When finally all was set, she turned on the recorder and resumed her dictating and fast pacing at 10:12.)</td><td>(休息的时候，珍必须把录音带翻个面，因为录音带快用到尾端了。这花了几分钟。一切安排就绪后，她打开录音机，在 10:12 恢复了她的传述和快节奏踱步。)</td></tr><tr><td>I think your new toy is fascinating.I did not have anything of that nature to play around with, and I doubt that Frank Watts even knew recorders existed.I hope that my friend Ruburt made the right adjustments.</td><td>我觉得你的新玩具很吸引人。我从来没玩过这类的东西，我猜弗兰克-沃茨甚至不 知道有录音机的存在。我希望我的朋友鲁伯做了正确的调整。</td></tr><tr><td>The point I wanted to make earlier was that evidence of what you call ESP will be arrived at.But as you receive evidence of sound through the ears and do not ordinarily expect to see through your ears, so the evidence must come through the correct channels.One of your main difficulties is that you will not accept as evidence anything which is not perceivable in one manner or another through the outer senses.That is, you will not consider an experience as valid unless it can be demonstrated as physical camouflage reality.</td><td>我刚才想说的是，你所谓的超感官知觉的证据将会出现。但是，由于你们是透过 耳朵来得到声音的证据，而通常也不会期待通过耳朵去看，所以证据必须经由正 确的管道而来。你的主要困难之一是，你不会接受任何不能通过外在感官以某种 方式感知的东西作为证据。也就是说，除非那个经历能够被证明是物质伪装的实 相，否则你不会认为那经历是真实合理的。</td></tr><tr><td>Almost everyone is familiar with something else, however, and that is the psychological experience which may have no observable physical effect, and yet can change a personality to a large degree.Now the change in the personality may have secondary physical effects.The personality may act in certain ways in the physical world as a result of a psychological experience.But these physical effects are secondary to the experience, and the experience of itself makes no physical effect upon the material world.Any such effects are made after the experience by the personality involved.</td><td>不过，几乎每个人都熟悉另外一种东西，那就是心理经验，这种经验可能没有可 观察到的身体影响，却能相当大的改变一个人格。现在，人格的改变可能会产生一些次要的身体影响。人格在物质世界中可能会因为心理经验而产生某些行为。但这些身体效应是次要的，经验本身并没有对物质世界产生物理影响。任何这种 影响都是在经验之后，由有关的人格作出的。</td></tr><tr><td>A death in a family, for example, is a physical occurrence.Various members of the family will react differently, as you know.The psychological experience will be intensely diversified, personal, unpredictable as far as each family member is concerned.You cannot observe this actual psychological experience with the outer senses.Even you yourself cannot see, smell, touch that inner experience.You cannot hold it in both hands and look it over.You cannot observe it in any objective manner, as you can observe a pencil on a table, yet it would be foolish to say that this psychological experience did not exist.It is too vivid to ignore, and oftentimes the personality is almost divorced from action because of this experience that is psychological, that cannot be observed with instruments, or even by the person involved.</td><td>比如说，一个家庭中的死亡事件，是一个实际发生的情况。你也知道，家庭中的 不同成员会有不同的反应。就每个家庭成员而言，心理经验也将会非常的多样 化、个人化、无法预测。你无法用外在感官观察这种实际的心理经验。甚至你自 己也无法看到、闻到、触摸到这种内在经验。你不能用双手握住它，仔细观察 它。你无法以任何客观的方式观察它，如你可以观察桌上的一支铅笔一样，然而 如果说这种心理经验不存在，那就太愚蠢了。它太生动，让人无法忽视，很多时 候，人格几乎与行动脱离了，因为这种经验是心理的，无法用仪器观察，甚至无 法由当事人观察到。</td></tr><tr><td>Now physical effects may follow, such as weeping, mourning and so forth, but these effects are secondary.The experience itself does not shed tears, though the receiver of the experience may shed tears.I am trying to show you here that many experiences in everyday life, which you know by their vividness to be valid, cannot be perceived by the outer senses.And yet you are completely familiar with them.</td><td>现在身体上的影响可能会随之而来，比如哭泣、哀悼等等，但这些影响都是次要 的。经历本身不会流泪，尽管经历的接收者可能会流泪。我在这里想告诉你，日 常生活中的许多经历，你由它们的生动性知道是真确的，但却不能被外在的感官 所感知。但你们却十分熟悉它们。</td></tr><tr><td>Your scientists with their instruments have succeeded in inducing the emotions of fear, sorrow, and so forth in some operations, but the experience itself remains subjective and psychological.Some physical effects, and again even these are secondary effects, may be observed as far as the emotions are concerned, in that pulses may quicken, certain chemicals and hormones may quicken their

内在的感官越来越多地出现在你们层面的整体自己的领域时，它们采取了情感的 种种特性，同时又在自己的内部保留住自己的特性。</td></tr><tr><td>If you follow them backwards as it were, they will lead you to the inner senses as such, while being at the same time the

slow.She later told me that at the beginning she was very nervous, since this was her first time before a witness.In addition we had more lights on than usual, and this bothered her at first.But the feeling soon left.)</td><td>(整节课，珍的声音都比往常更强而有力，更加低沉。她的眼睛和往常一样变得漆 黑，步伐缓慢。她后来告诉我，一开始她很紧张，因为这是她第一次有见证人在场。此外，我们开的灯也比平时多，一开始有点困扰她。但这种感觉很快就消失了。)</td></tr><tr><td>You are excellent teachers, I must admit.However, Joseph, while I admit I came uninvited, and while I understand the reason for last night's absence, I took it for granted that we would have our regular session this evening.And I find it very impolite of you to restrain me in this fashion.</td><td>我必须承认，你们是很优秀的老师。然而，约瑟，虽然我承认我是不请自来，虽 然我理解昨晚缺课的原因，我也理所当然地认为今晚我们会有一堂定期课。我觉 得你这样阻止我是非常的不礼貌。</td></tr><tr><td>Our sessions are important,

were polite to your guest and I recognize his presence.You were not, however, as polite with me.Ruburt was dubious about a session with company present.However he was willing to listen to me irregardless, and I must admit that in no way do I understand your cutting me off in such a brusque manner.</td><td>然而今晚却不一样。你对客人很有礼貌，我也知道他在场。然而，你对我却没有 那么客气。鲁伯对有客人在场的课程心存迟疑。然而他还是愿意听我的话，老实 说，我完全不能理解你会用这种粗鲁的方式来截断这节课。</td></tr><tr><td>You know that I have no objections to your friend's presence, since I stated this earlier.For that matter I welcome a witness, and it is time that you had oneâfor your own edification, not mine, and it should do my nervous pigeon Ruburt some good.</td><td>你知道我并不反对你的朋友在场，因为我之前已经说过了。就这件事而言，我欢 迎有见证人，现在是你有一个证人的时候了，这是为了你自己的教化，而不是我 的，这对我那紧张的鲁伯也应该有好处。</td></tr><tr><td>I wanted to reply in some manner to your friend's question on evolution.However I shall do so in my own fashion per usual.I will speak later about last evening and about your reactions.</td><td>我想以某种方式回答你朋友关于演化的问题。不过，我还是要以我自己的方式来 回答。我稍后再谈昨晚的事和你的反应。</td></tr><tr><td>When you speak of evolution, and when your friend asked the question, you think in terms of human evolution, of course.</td><td>当你们说到演化，当你的朋友提出这个问题时，你们想的当然是人类的演化。</td></tr><tr><td>This is in itself an expression of the dualism of which I have spoken.Evolution does not of course apply only to the human species, and as I have said consciousness on your plane exists in all things.When your friend asked his question he was, I believe, referring to the point at which self-consciousness entered into so-called inert form.</td><td>这本身就是我所说的二元论的一种表现。演化当然不只适用于人类物种，正如我 所说，你们层面上的所有东西都有意识。当你的朋友提出他的问题时，我相信， 他指的是自身意识[self-consciousness]进入所谓惰性形式[inert form]的那一个点。</td></tr><tr><td>You know now that so-called inert form has consciousness.To some degree it even possesses self-consciousness, and so there is no point at which self-consciousness entered, so to speak, with the sound of trumpets.Consciousness, to a degree, was inherent in the first materialization physically upon your plane.</td><td>你现在知道，所谓的惰性形式也有意识。在某种程度上，它甚至拥有自身意识， 所以没有自身意识伴随着一声号角而进入的那么一刻。意识，在一定程度上，在 你们层面上一开始实体化时就是天生具有的。</td></tr><tr><td>Self-consciousness entered in very shortly after, but not what you are pleased to call human self-consciousness.I certainly do not like to wound your egos in this manner.However the fact remains, and I can hear you all yell foul, that there is no actual differentiation between the various types of self-consciousness.</td><td>自身意识很快就进入了，但不是你们乐于称之为人类的自身意识。我当然不喜欢 这样子伤害你们的自我。然而事实如此，我可以听到你们都在骂脏话了，各种类 型的自身意识之间并没有实际的区别。</td></tr><tr><td>You are either conscious of self or you are not.On your plane self-consciousness exists as a rule.A tree is conscious of itself as a tree.It does not think of itself as a rock.A dog knows it is not a cat.What I am trying to point out to you here is this supreme egotistical presumption that self-consciousness must of necessity involve humanity per se.It does not.</td><td>你要么有自身意识，要么没有。在你们层面上，自身意识是作为一种规则存在 的。树意识到自己是一棵树。它不认为自己是一块石头。狗知道牠不是猫。在这 里我想向你指出的是，这种至高无上的自我本位的推测，即自身意识必然涉及人 类本身。但它不是。</td></tr><tr><td>If I am answering your friend's question in a roundabout manner it is only because, my dear Josephâand I still call you my dear Joseph, although you scarcely deserve itâthen it is only because there are things that I feel it is necessary that I clear up before the question can be answered with even a hint of correctness.</td><td>如果我以迂回的方式回答你朋友的问题，那只是因为，我亲爱的约瑟—我仍然称 你为我亲爱的约瑟，虽然你几乎配不上这个称呼—那只是因为在回答问题之前， 我觉得有必要先厘清一些事情，才能提供哪怕仅有一丝正确性的提示。</td></tr><tr><td>So-called human consciousness did not suddenly appear.Our poor maligned friend, the ape, did not suddenly beat his hairy chest in exaltation and cry "I am a man." There was no such point and this, if you will forgive my pun, is my point.</td><td>所谓的人类意识并不是突然出现的。我们那可怜的被人诟病的朋友--猿人，并没 有突然拍着毛茸茸的胸脯高呼 "我是人"。没有这样的一个点[point]，如果你能原谅我的双关语，这就是我的观点[point]。</td></tr><tr><td>The beginnings of human consciousness, on the other hand, began as soon as multicellular groupings began to form in field patterns of a certain complexity.While there was no specific point of entry as far as human consciousness was concerned, there was a point before which human consciousness as such did not exist.Self-consciousness did exist.The consciousness of being human in your terms was fully developed in the caveman, butâand I cannot emphasize this enoughâthe human conception was alive in the fish.</td><td>而人类意识的开始，则是在多细胞群开始形成一定复杂的场域模式时就开始了。虽然就人类意识而言，并没有具体的切入点，但确实有一个点，在这个点之前， 人类意识并不存在。自身意识确实存在。以你们的术语来说，身为人的意识在穴 居人身上就已有了充分的发展，但是—我怎么强调都不为过—人的概念也活在鱼 类中。</td></tr><tr><td>All this involved an idea of, and I hesitate to say advancement, but an idea of change along certain lines.We have spoken of mental genes.These are more or less psychic blueprints for physical matter, and in these mental genes existed the pattern for your human type of self-consciousness.It did not appear constructed, that is in constructed form, for a long period of physical time however, and we have discussed psychological time as being part of what I will call for now an inner time sense.</td><td>这一切都涉及到一种概念，我不太愿意称它是进步，而是一种沿着某些路线变化 的概念。我们已经谈到了精神基因。这些或多或少是物质的灵性蓝图，在这些精 神基因中，存在着你们人类那种自身意识的模式。然而，在很长的一段物理时间 内，它并没有出现建构，也就是没有以结构的形式出现，我们已经讨论过心理时 间是我目前称之为内在时间感的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>This human self-consciousness existed in psychological time and in inner time long before you as a species constructed it in terms of your particular camouflage patterns.For your friend's sake I will simplify this, saying that human consciousness was inherent and latent from the beginning of your physical universe.</td><td>人类的这种自身意识，早在你们做为一个物种，以你们特定的伪装模式建构它之 前，就已存在于心理时间和内在时间之内。为了你的朋友，我将简化说明，人类 的意识从你们物质宇宙一开始，就已潜伏存在着。</td></tr><tr><td>I would now suggest a brief break, and do not again crack up into many pieces.I give you this very slight evidence of my humor merely to show that I am not after all one to carry grudges.</td><td>我现在建议大家稍作休息，别再裂成一堆碎片[break 双关语, 有休息和破裂之意]。我秀一点我幽默感的小证据，表示我毕竟不是一个小肚鸡肠之辈。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:57.John Bradley reported that Seth as he went along began to answer each question heâJohnâthought of as soon as it came to mind.Jane and I suggested to John that he write a statement as a witness to the session.Break ended just as John, trying to get entity names versus personality names straightened out, was wondering how to address Seth in his statement.Resume at 11:05. )</td><td>(10:57 休息。约翰-布拉德利说，赛斯随着他的进行，他-约翰-只要他一想到问题，赛斯就开始一一回答。珍和我建议约翰写一份声明，作为课程的见证。休息 结束时，正值约翰想把存有名与人格名搞清楚，正琢磨着如何在声明中称呼赛斯。11:05

failing of mine but I enjoy it.And you, Philip, were twice a woman and once a Moor of some considerable stature, as well as the personality in Boston which I have already related.</td><td>如果你能原谅我，我总是很高兴让熟人知道我以前就认识他们，好让他们的当前 人格大吃一惊。这是我的缺点，但我喜欢这样。而你，菲利普，有两次是女人， 一次是有相当地位的摩尔人，还有我提过的在波士顿的那个人格。</td></tr><tr><td>There are many times that our paths have crossed, and that is why I wanted you here, and why you happened onto the art gallery where Ruburt is employed.Not that free will is not involved, because it certainly is involved.Only that old friends have a way of meeting.And I was not joking when I spoke of a predisposition to gout, for you have also been lecherous in your way.</td><td>我们的路交会过许多次， 这就是为什么我希望你在这里， 为什么你碰巧到鲁伯工作的艺术画廊。并不是说不涉及自由意志，因为它肯定是涉及的。只是老朋友 总有碰面的办法。而我说你有痛风的倾向，并不是开玩笑，因为你也曾以你的方 式好色过。</td></tr><tr><td>(I laughed.</td><td>(我笑了。</td></tr><tr><td>("Like me?")</td><td>("像我一样？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Indeed like you, my dear Joseph.In your case, Joseph, and I have said this many times, you overcompensate now for past, shall I say fleshiness, by a most unnecessary esthetic and self-punishing attitude.Philip on the other hand is performing no such compensations, except for the one instance of choosing a good-looking wife and therefore permitting himself to treat her kindly.</td><td>确实像你，我亲爱的约瑟。对于你，约瑟，我已经说过很多次了，你现在对过去 是矫枉过正，我应该说在肉体上，用一个最不必要的审美和自我惩罚的态度。而 菲利浦除了选择一个漂亮的妻子，并让自己善待她这个例子之外，没有做这样的 补偿。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now it was John 's turn to laugh.Neither Jane or I have met his wife.

- N - S - D - A - T - T - E - R(斯拉夫安斯达特)。当时他 33岁，因为一个应该说是不慎的行为被抓到，为此他遭到了严重和无理的毒打。之所以不合理，因为那个猪头丈夫，请原谅我的双关语，是头讨人厌的野猪[boar 野猪与bore 讨厌鬼同音]。而他现在，作为约翰，因为业务关系认识这位前世的丈夫。</td></tr><tr><td>I must admit that this brings us far afield from our discussion of evolution.</td><td>我必须承认，这距离我们讨论的演化，远得不沾边儿了。</td></tr><tr><td>It is important that you tie in this evolutionary material with previous data concerning the inner senses.The inner senses were always paramount in evolutionary development, being the impetus behind the physical formations; and themselves, through the use of mental enzymes, imprinting the data contained in the mental genes onto the physical camouflage material.</td><td>重要的是，你要把这个演化的资料和以前关于内在感官的资讯结合起来。内在感 官在演化发展中始终是最重要的，是物质形态背后的动力；并且它们自己通过使

must be considered some gigantic tree with humanity as the supreme blossom.</td><td>我确实变得不耐烦了，虽然不应该，但这种暗示性的坚持，认为演化仅仅涉及人 类物种，或者说，一切的演化都有如一棵巨树，而人类就是那至高无上的花朵。</td></tr><tr><td>Humanity's so-called supreme blossom is the human ego, and this is at times a poisoning blossom indeed.As I have said before, there is nothing wrong with the ego.The point however remains that man became so fascinated with the conscious ego that he ignored the part of himself that made the ego possible, and ignored the part of himself that gives to the ego the very powers of which he is so consciously proud.</td><td>人类所谓的至高无上的花朵就是人类的自我，而这有时确实是一朵毒花。我以前 说过，自我并没有错。然而，问题的关键在于，人类变得如此着迷于有意识的自 我，以至于他忽略了使自我成为可能的那部分自己，也忽略了给予自我他如此有 意识地引以为傲的力量的那部分自己。</td></tr><tr><td>There is behind the ego a stronger and more vivid self.There is even a more self-conscious self of which he remains in ignorance.And again as I have said, evidence for this self can be and will be received.</td><td>在自我的背后，有一个更强大、更生动的自己。甚至还有一个更有自身意识的自 己，而他仍然对此一无所知。而且再次如我所说的，对于自己的这个证据，可以 而且将会被接收到。</td></tr><tr><td>I will go into this in a few moments.Again I suggest a break, and I hope I haven't

Ruburt that I am I, and not her, meaning Jane; like a good evidence of telepathy, as in John's case this evening.</td><td>我想说明一点，但首先，没有什么比一个见证人更能说服我亲爱的紧张的鲁伯相 信，我就是我，而不是她，我是指珍；就如今晚约翰在场的情况，就是一个很好 的心灵感应的佐证。</td></tr><tr><td>(See John Bradley's statement at the end of this session.  )</td><td>(见约翰-布拉德利在本次课程结束时的声明)。</td></tr><tr><td>Nor should John-Philip forget what I have told him as far as gout predisposition is concerned.</td><td>约翰-菲利普也不要忘记我告诉他的关于他有痛风倾向的事。</td></tr><tr><td>Now the point I wanted to make is that again as I have said, in the same manner that psychological experience is real and vivid and yet cannot be seen or touched or examined in your laboratories, so is inner data from the inner senses vivid, though it cannot be seen or touched.</td><td>现在我想说的是，正如我所说的，心理经验是真实的、生动的，但却不能在你们 的实验室里被看到、触摸到或检验，同样，来自内在感官的内在资讯也是生动的，尽管它也看不见摸不着。</td></tr><tr><td>Such inner data makes its impression upon the physical brain and changes the personality as does any experience.In many cases such inner experience is retained in your memory cells.If you would simply for once, and for once Joseph I am not referring to you particularly, if you would for once demonstrate an openness and a willingness to accept such data on its own basis, without insisting upon evidence from the regular senses, then and only then will you have evidence that the outer senses can recognize.</td><td>这样的内在资讯会给肉体的头脑留下印象，并像任何经验一样改变人格。在许多 情况下，这样的内在经验被保留在你的记忆细胞中。如果你只要有一次，约瑟， 我不是特指你，如果你只要能有一次，表现出一种开放的态度，愿意在其自身的 基础上接受这样的资讯，而不坚持常规感官的证据，那么，也只有这样，你才会 有外在感官能够识别的证据。</td></tr><tr><td>This involves, to begin with, an almost impossible task.Data from the inner senses is vivid, it is reliable, it makes an impression upon the conscious individual.It is your insistence upon translating this material into physical terms that causes your difficulty.You do not insist upon seeing, feeling or touching a psychological experience, and yet you do not say that a psychological experience does not exist because you cannot hold it in both hands.</td><td>这从一开始就涉及到，几乎是不可能完成的任务。来自内在感官的资讯是生动 的，是可靠的，它能给有意识的个人留下印象。是你坚持要把这些资料转译成物 理术语，才导致了你的困难。你不必坚持看到、感觉到或触摸到心理经验，但你 不能说因为你不能用双手握住它，心理经验就不存在。</td></tr><tr><td>Why then do you insist that an inner experience such as telepathy or premonition does not exist because you cannot hold it in both hands?And yet in many instances such cases can be corroborated by others in a manner in which a purely psychological experience cannot be corroborated.</td><td>那你为什么坚持说心灵感应或预感等内在经验不存在，就因为你不能用双手握住 它吗？纯粹的心理经验是无法被他人证实的，而心灵感应或预感很多时候，这些 例子却是可以被他人佐证的。</td></tr><tr><td>There is no way of measuring the inner experience, or the psychological experience rather, of someone who has lost a friend in death, but you do not deny that such an experience exists.Yet if two people see, in your terms see, the same apparition, then instantly we must speak in terms of the weight of the apparition seen, the color of the eyes.For any so-called extrasensory perceptions you insist upon twice the evidence, and under circumstances when the evidence is vivid in its own terms and must be translated first, before you will accept it, into the alien outside senses, which simply are not equipped to receive it.This is for Philip's edification, I hope.</td><td>没有办法测量一个人在朋友过世后的内心体验，或者说心理经历，但你不能否认 这种体验的存在。然而，如果两个人看到，用你们的术语的看到，看到了同一个 幽灵，那么我们马上就会从重量的角度来谈所看到的幽灵，及眼睛的颜色。对于 任何所谓的超感觉知，你都坚持两倍的证据，证据本身要鲜活生动，在你接受它 之前，还必须先把它转译成另类的外部感觉，你才肯接受，而外在感官根本不具 备接受它的条件。我希望这能为菲利普提供些启发。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not saying that you should not believe the evidence of your senses; I am waiting for you to say that.We know that our so-called tables are not solid.Even your science knows this now, and yet your eyes see the table as solid.Face up to it, my dear lovelies: Your senses lie.The table is a conglomeration of quickly-moving atoms and molecules but you see it as a table, and you see it as solid.Your senses, and again this is to bring John-Philip up to date, your senses are perceptron of a camouflage physical world which is created by the inner self through the use of mental enzymes in a pattern set by the mental genes.</td><td>我不是说你们不要相信感官的证据，我正等着你说这些话。我们知道，我们所谓的桌子并不是坚实的。现在连你们的科学也知道这一点，可是你们的眼睛却把桌子看成是坚实的。承认吧，我亲爱的宝贝们：你们的感官在说谎。桌子是快速移动的原子和分子的聚合体，但你们却把它看成是桌子，把它看成固体。你的感 官，这也是为了让约翰-菲利普跟上最新讯息，你的感官是伪装的物质世界的感知 器，它是由内在自己，通过使用精神酵素，以精神基因设定的模式创造的。</td></tr><tr><td>You are dealing with camouflage.Your outside senses are perceptron of camouflage, and your table which you rest your arms upon is not solid.This does not mean that your arms will suddenly fall to the floor.It does mean that even your science is discovering the existence of the inside world, which it will be unable to deny much longer.</td><td>你所面对的是伪装。你的外在感官是伪装的感知器，你的手臂所靠着的桌子也并 不坚实。这并不意味着你的手臂会突然掉到地上。这确实意味着，即使是你们的 科学，也发现了内在世界的存在，不久将无法再否认这一点了。</td></tr><tr><td>Because I say that you create your physical universe in the same manner and as automatically and as un-self-consciously as you create with your breath a pattern of steam upon a glass plane, this does not mean that you create All That Is.It merely means that you create your own physical environment.And if I have your permission, Joseph, we will meet tomorrow evening to go into other matters.</td><td>因为我说，你以同样的方式，自动且不自觉地创造了你的物质宇宙，就像你哈气 在一片玻璃上，创造出一种蒸汽图案一样，这并不意味着你创造了 "一切万有"。这仅仅意味着你创造了你自己的物质环境。如果你同意，约瑟，我们明天晚上再 来讨论其他事情。</td></tr><tr><td>John-Philip is correct, and our schedule should be maintained.Personally I have no objections to an extra session for Ruburt's publisher, but I will not condone less than two regular sessions a week, except for circumstances beyond your control.</td><td>约翰-菲利普是对的，我们应该维持我们的时间表。就我个人而言，我不反对为鲁

manner.I am so fond of you, my pigheaded Joseph, that it pains me severely to see you so misuse yourself.And as for towering-strength Ruburt, don't depend upon this too far, for a weaker tower of strength I have never seen.</td><td>昨晚那种情况，如果你能多帮点忙，你就不需要用那种自残的方式把情绪转向内 在。我那么喜欢你，我执拗的约瑟，看到你如此虐待自己，我很痛心。至于巍然 如塔的鲁伯，也别太依赖他的力量，因为我没见过比他更弱的力量之塔。</td></tr><tr><td>And now, dear loves, a fond good

through.</td><td>我们的交流之所以成功，原因之一是你们俩身上存在的特殊能力，以及它们之间 的相互作用，还有你们俩让我对它们的利用。鲁伯的智力必须是高质量的。他的 意识和无意识的心智一开始就必须熟悉某些观念，才能使这些资料的复杂性得以 体现。</td></tr><tr><td>In the beginning, for example, there is always a

上是这样。所以，个人偏见最少的人，就是优秀的人选。比如说，如果鲁伯的偏 见恰好与我所知道的真实情况不相矛盾，那就更好了，阻力就会小得多。</td></tr><tr><td>There must of necessity be in the beginning a distortion, but this comes because of the give and take between us.If our communications involved, or if any such communications involved invasion, there would be no distortion because the individual so invaded would be blotted out.And this is not possible.</td><td>开始时必然会有扭曲，但这是因为我们之间的折衷取舍而产生的。如果我们的交 流涉及到，或者说任何这样的交流是以侵入的方式进行，就不会有失真，因为被 入侵的个体就会被抹去。而这是不可能的。</td></tr><tr><td>When you are tired we will break, or you may move about the room,

colored.People strongly believing in your organized religions color the material in a manner that is highly disadvantageous, and that unfortunately often adds to existing superstitions.Ruburt's mind, believe it or not, is much like my own; though, if you'll forgive me, in a very limited fashion, therefore the distortions are much less distortive, much less harmful, and more easily discovered and cleared.</td><td>像这样的资料，是经过多层潜意识概念的筛选，随后被染上颜色。坚信你们有组 织的宗教的人，会以一种非常不利的方式给资料上色，不幸的是，这些往往会被 添加到现有的迷信中。鲁伯的心智，不管你信不信，和我自己的心智很像；不 过，如果你原谅我的话，是以非常有限的方式，因此，扭曲的程度要小得多，危 害性要小得多，而且更容易发现和清除。</td></tr><tr><td>You

I will tell you the reasons later, but regardless of his flamboyance and seeming disregard, he needs space division of certain activities, and privacy from the outside world.He deals with the outside world in a very constructive manner, provided that a division is set up between him and it so that it cannot leak through. Some illusion of an entryway would be helpful in your main room. He is extremely modest in strange ways; that is.

You will probably have to work out practical solutions.  I hesitate to advise.

"</td><td>有一两次他在找寻迹象，这真不是个健康的反应。首先，鲁伯的自我极为强大。鲁伯的直觉是放松原本顽固又跋扈的有意识自我的门户。然而直觉的品质是不轻 狂的，人格也是整合的。对此不必害怕。</td></tr><tr><td>Also, Ruburt has experienced and used dissociation, though to a lesser degree, before our communications; that is, in his work, and knows how to handle it.I do not want either of you to be worried.On the other hand, I don't want Ruburt to fight me, either.</td><td>另外，鲁伯在我们的沟通之前，已经经历并使用过解离，虽然程度较轻；就是在 他工作时，他知道如何处理。我不希望你们任何一个人担心。另一方面，我也不 希望鲁伯跟我对抗。</td></tr><tr><td>Our relationship should enable you both to deal more adequately with the outside world.I will never suggest that you try to escape it.Your development of the inner senses will not blot out the outer world.It will enable you to see it more clearly for what it is, and therefore you will be able to manipulate camouflage patterns more adequately.</td><td>我们的关系应该能让你们俩更充分地处理好与外界的关系。我绝不会建议你们试 图逃避它。你的内在感官的发展不会遮蔽外在世界。它能让你更清楚地看到它的 本质，因此你将能更充分地操纵伪装的模式</td></tr><tr><td>I am anxious to go into some further material, but I want to set your doubts at rest.When Ruburt is not aware of his surroundings during a session, he is still aware of his surroundings to some degree, and can return to them.Because you open a door, this does not mean that you cannot close it or open another door, nor does it mean that you cannot have two doors open at once, and that is my point.</td><td>我渴望进一步探讨一些资料，但我想消解你们的疑虑。当鲁伯在课程中没有意识 到周遭环境时，他仍然在一定程度上意识到周遭的环境，并且可以回到现实环境 中。因为当你打开一扇门，这并不意味着你不能关上它，或打开另一扇门，也不 意味着你不能同时打开两扇门，这是我的看法。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true that the conscious mind must be relaxed to some extent, and that a state of apparent dissociation is necessary.Now, believe it or not, this will not always necessarily be the case.You can have two doors open at once.You can listen to two channels at once.But until you learn to focus in two directions, and this is simplified to a pathetic degree, in the meantime you simply turn down the volume of the first channel, while you attract your attention to the second. This process you call dissociation.</td><td>的确，有意识的心智必须要放松到某种程度，而且必须到一种明显的解离状态。现在，不管你信不信，情况不一定总是这样。你可以同时打开两扇门。你可以同 时听两个频道。但在你学会在两个方向上集中注意力之前，这已经简化到了一个</td></tr><tr><td>You, Joseph, and Ruburt, are basically well-balanced, and sensible as well as intuitional, and you are in absolutely no danger at all.</td><td>可怜的程度，在此期间，你只需把第一个频道的音量调低，同时把你的注意力吸 引到第二个频道。这个过程你们称之为解离。</td></tr><tr><td>I was going to suggest if I may be so bold another innovation, but you have already adopted or returned to it.  That is, it will be a good policy to arise at 7:30, and get your painting time in.  I do not want to take up all your working hours, and you must have time to paint.  I see no harm in sleeping until 8:00 the morning after a session, but a balance of schedule is important, and you can see that I wish to relate you to yourself and your work, and not to turn all your energies toward myself.</td><td>你，约瑟，还有鲁伯，基本上是很平衡健全的，理智而且直观，你们完全没有危 险。</td></tr><tr><td>("What do you have to say about the psychiatrist's idea, that all this is merely Jane's subconscious talking?")</td><td>我本来想建议，如果我可以大胆地提出另一种创新，但你们已经采用或重回到了 它。那就是七点半起床，把你的绘画时间安排好，这将会是一个好策略。我不想 占用你所有的工作时间，你必须有时间画画。我认为在一次课程结束后，睡到早 上八点没有坏处，但均衡的日程表是很重要的，你可以看到，我希望把你与你自 己以及你的工作联系起来，而不是把你所有的精力都转向我这里。</td></tr><tr><td>We have gone into this before, and I have no doubt that we will on endless occasions; and if I succeed in convincing you of my reality as a personality I will have done exceedingly well.It should be apparent, and I've said this before, that my communications come through Ruburt's subconscious.

years, these years are but a flash to the entity.The entity is concerned with these years in the same manner that you are concerned with your dreams.As you give inner purpose and organization to your dreams, and as you obtain insight and satisfaction from your dreams though they involve only a part of your life, so the entity to some extent directs and gives purpose and organization to his personalities during their existence.And so does the entity obtain insights and satisfactions from his existing personalities, although no one takes up all of his own attentions.</td><td>个人的生命，或者说目前这个体的人生，可以合理地比作为一个存有的梦。虽然 个人在他既有的年岁中受苦与享乐，但这些岁月对存有来说只是一闪而过。存有 关注这些岁月，就像你关注你的梦一样。如同你赋予你的梦内在的目的和组织， 如同你从你的梦中获得洞察和满足感，虽然它们仅涉及你人生的一部分，同样， 存有在某种程度上，指导和赋予他的人格在他们存在期间的目的和组织。存有也 从他现有的人格中获得洞察和满足感，虽然没有一个人格占据存有自己的全部注 意力。</td></tr><tr><td>And as your dreams originate with you, rise from you, attain a seeming independence and have their ending with you, so do an entity's personalities arise from him, attain various degrees of independence, and return to him while never leaving him for an instant.</td><td>就像你的梦，源自于你，由你升起，获得似乎的独立，并以你为终点一样，一个

the relationship of the entity to its personalities.They are independent to varying degrees, and they operate on various planes for purposes of overall fulfillment and development.</td><td>通过阅读，你熟悉了所谓的次要人格。曾有过一些一个人拥有三种人格的案例。这个概念接近于存有与人格的关系。他们有不同程度的独立性，各自在不同层面 上运作，以达到整体实现和发展的目的。</td></tr><tr><td>To a lesser degree, you function along these lines in varying roles when you exist simultaneously as a member of a family, a member of a community, a nation, and as an artist or a writer.As you attempt to use your abilities so does the entity attempt to use his abilities, and he organizes his various personalities and to some extent directs their activities while still allowing them what you would call free will.</td><td>当你同时作为一个家庭的成员、一个社区的成员、一个国家的成员，以及作为一 个艺术家或一个作家而存在时，你也是在较小的程度上，在不同的角色中沿着这 些路线运作。当你试图使用你的能力时，存有也试图使用他的能力，他组织他的 各种人格，并在某种程度上指导他们的活动，同时仍然允许这些人格有你们所称 的自由意志。</td></tr><tr><td>There exists infinities of diversity and opportunity for the personalities, and this diversity is given to it, to it meaning the personality, by the entity.Your own dreams are fragments, even as in a much larger sense you are fragments of your entity.An unrecognized unity and organization lies within all of your dreams, beneath their diversity.And your dreams, while part of you, actually exist apart.That is, you have given them a certain independence.This is difficult to explain clearly, and may be rather difficult for you to swallow whole.I hope you don't choke.</td><td>人格存在着无限的多样性和机会，这种多样性是存有赋予它的，对它意味着个 性。你自己的梦是片段，甚至在更大的意义上来说，你是你存有的片段。在你所 有的梦中，在它们的多样性之下，有一个未被认识的统一和组织。而你的梦，虽 然是你的一部分，但实际上是分开存在的。也就是说，你赋予了它们一定的独立性。这是很难解释清楚的，对你来说，也许很难整个吞下去。希望你不要被噎 住。</td></tr><tr><td>(In the above paragraph the phrases "meaning the personality," and "a much larger sense," came clearly to my mind just before Jane voiced them.The match was exact both times.For some reason it made an impression on me, whereas many times while Jane is dictating I have had a thought similar to the one Jane was about to voice.I might be too sensitive about this instance simply because of John Bradley's telepathic experience in the 26th session. )</td><td>(上文中，"意味着个性 "和 "更大的意义 "这两句话，在珍说出这两句话之前，我的脑海中就已经清晰地浮现出来。两次都完全吻合。不知道为什么，这给我留下 了深刻的印象，而很多时候，当珍在传述的时候，我也有类似于珍将要说出的想 法。我对这个情况可能过于敏感，纯粹就只是因为在第 26 节课中，约翰-布拉德利的心灵感应的经验。</td></tr><tr><td>However, as I have said there is great similarity between your relationship to your dreams, and to the entity's relationship to his personality.What I did not make plain was that your dreams are part of a plane, and exist on it as you exist on your plane.</td><td>然而，正如我说过的，你与你的梦的关系，和存有与他的人格之间的关系有很大 的相似性。我没有说清楚的是，你的梦是一个层面的一部分，它存在于层面上， 就像你存在于你的层面上一样。</td></tr><tr><td>That dream world has its own reality, its own time, which is different from your concept of time, and its own inner organization.As the entity is only partially concerned with its personalities after setting them into motion, so you are unconcerned with this dream world which you have set into motion.But it exists.</td><td>那个梦境世界有它自己的实相，有它自己的时间，这与你们的时间概念不同，也 有它自己的内在组织。由于存有在启动了它的人格之后，只是部分地关注它的人 格，而你对这个你启动的梦境世界是漠不关心的。但它存在。</td></tr><tr><td>To a different degree it is filled with conscious semi personalities.I call them semi personalities merely to point out that they are not as developed as you are, as you are not as developed as your entity is.Nevertheless, that dream world experiences continuity.It is not aware of any break while, for example, you are sleeping.It does not know you sleep or wake.It merely exists to a fairly vivid degree while you sleep, and it sleeps but does not die while you are awake.</td><td>在不同程度上，梦世界充满了有意识的半人格。我称他们为半人格，只是为了指 出他们不像你那样的已经进展，如同你不像你的存有那样的发达进展。然而，那 个梦世界的经历是连续性的。它不知道有任何中断，比如说，你在睡眠中。它并 不知道你是睡是醒。它只是在你入睡时，栩栩如生地存在着，而当你醒时，它睡 着但并未消逝。</td></tr><tr><td>This is very important, however.Again I suggest a break, merely because this material is new, and we seem to get better reception with short half-hour rests.</td><td>这一点非常重要。我再次建议休息一下，因为这个资料是新的，有个半小时的休 息，似乎可以有更好的接收效果。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:30.Jane said that during this delivery she was "far out", although she was aware that she was voicing some new and startling material.. .She reports that as a delivery nears its end, Seth begins to recede slowly, and at the same time she slowly regains conscious awareness of her surroundings.There is nothing sudden or startling involved.Resume at 10:35.)</td><td>"(10:30 休息。珍说，在这次传达中，她 ""出离的很远 ""，虽然她仍意识到她正在说出一些新的、令人震惊的资料。她说，当传述接近尾声时，赛斯开始慢慢地退去，同时她也慢慢地恢复了对周遭环境的觉察。并没有什么突发或令人错愕之 处。10:35 继续)。"</td></tr><tr><td>The entity itself does not have to keep constant check on its personalities, because in each personality there is an inner self-conscious part that knows its origin.This part, for now, I will call the self-conscious beyond the subconscious.The breather and the dreamer are not so automatically controlled as it would seem.I have mentioned before that some part of you knows exactly how much oxygen the lungs breathe, and how much energy it takes to pace a floor, and this is the part of you of which I spoke.It is the part, and the self-conscious part, that receives all inner data.</td><td>存有本身不需要不断地检查它的人格，因为在每一个人格中都有一个内在的自觉 意识部分，它知道自己的起源。这个部分，我暂且称之为超越潜意识的自觉意 识。呼吸者和做梦者并不像看起来那般被自动控制着。我以前提到过，你的某个部分清楚地知道肺部呼吸了多少氧气，以及在地板上踱步需要多少能量，那就是 我所说的这个部分的你。是这个部分的你以及自觉意识那部分的你在接收所有的 内在资讯。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you want to move?</td><td>你想活动一下吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("No.  "</td><td>("不想。"</td></tr><tr><td>(I had been trying to get comfortable in my chair.)</td><td>(我一直试着在我的椅子上坐得舒服点。)。</td></tr><tr><td>The part that translates inner data sifts it down through the subconscious, which is a barrier and also a threshold to the present personality as it operates on the camouflage plane.I have mentioned many times how vitality changes as it approaches and forms various planes.I have said that the topmost part of the subconscious contains personal memories.That beneath these are racial memories and so forth.Things are simply not layered in the way I speak of them.But continuing with the necessary analogy, on the other side of (or beneath to you) the racial memories, you no longer exist within your plane, and look out upon another with the face of this other self-conscious part of you.This part receives inner data, is in contact with the entity, to some greater degree than you are in contact with your dreams, and actually directs all the important functions that you think are either automatically controlled, or unconsciously controlled.</td><td>转译内在资讯的那部分，通过潜意识把资料筛选下来，这对于在伪装层面上运作 的当前人格是一个障碍，也是一个门槛。我曾多次提过，生命力在接近和形成各 种层面时如何转变。我说过，潜意识的最上层包含个人记忆。在这层之下是种族 记忆等等。事情根本不是我说的那样分层。但还是要继续这必要的类比，在种族 记忆的另一侧(或者说在你之下)，你不再存在于你的层面之内，而是以你另一 个自觉意识那个部分，去看向另一个层面。这个部分接收内在资讯，与存有接 触，在某种程度上比你与梦境接触的程度还要大，它实际上指挥着所有你认为是 自动控制，或是无意识控制的重要功能。</td></tr><tr><td>When such abilities as telepathy occur, this telepathic function is carried on continually by this other self-conscious part of you, but as a rule you act upon such data without the knowledge of the conscious self with which you are familiar.I wanted to at least get into this material this evening, because while it may sound complex to you now, it is really basic.And it is knowledge that you must have before we can go further.</td><td>当发生心灵感应这样的能力时，这种心灵感应的功能是由你的这个另一个自觉意 识的部分持续地进行的，但通常情况下，你是在你所熟悉的意识自己不知道的情 况下根据这些资讯采取行动的。今晚我至少要谈一下这个资料，因为虽然现在对 你来说可能听起来很复杂，但它确实是基本的。而在我们进一步深入之前，你必 须掌握这些知识。</td></tr><tr><td>There is also a corresponding, but lesser, self-consciousness that connects your present personalities with the dream world, which is aware of its origin and communicates data from you to it.Again you are no more aware of your dream creations, and no less aware than your entity is of you, but in the last analysis you are aware and connected with your entity through this self-conscious part of you that faces another plane.</td><td>还有一个相应的，但次要的自身意识，它将你们现在的人格与梦境世界相连接， 它觉知自己的起源，并且从你这里向它传递着资讯。再次地，你对你的梦境创作 的觉察，比起你的存有对你的觉察是不遑多让的，追根结底，你是通过你这个， 面向另一个层面的自觉意识部分，来觉察和连接你的存有。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane laughed.) There is of course an apparent contradiction here, but it is only apparent.It is certainly to you contradictory, your dilemma being this: if you have another self-conscious self, then (with a laugh) why aren't you aware of it?(Laugh. )</td><td>(珍笑了)。当然，这里有一个明显的矛盾，但它只是表面的。对你来说，这当然 是矛盾的，你的困境是：如果你有另一个自身意识的自己，那么(带着笑)。你为什么不知道呢？(笑)</td></tr><tr><td>Pretend that you are some weird creature with two faces.One face looks out upon one world and one looks out upon another.Imagine, further, this poor creature having a brain to go with each face, and each brain interprets reality in terms of the world it looks upon.Yet the worlds are different, and more, the creatures are Siamese twins.</td><td>假装你是一个有两张脸的奇怪生物。一张脸看向一个世界，另一张脸看向另一个 世界。再想象一下，这可怜的生物，每张脸都配有一个大脑，而每个大脑都会根 据所看到的世界来诠释实相。然而两个世界是不同的，而且，这生物还是连体的 双胞胎。</td></tr><tr><td>At the same time imagine that these creatures are really one creature, but with definite parts equipped to handle two entirely different worlds.The subconscious therefore, in this truly ludicrous analogy, would exist between the two brains, and would enable the creature to operate as a single unity.At the same time, and this is the difficult part to explain, neither of the two faces would ever see the other world.They would not be aware of each other.And yet each would be fully self-conscious.</td><td>同时想象一下，这些生物其实是一个生物，但却配备有有明确的部分，来处理两 个完全不同的世界。因此，在这个真的很荒唐的比喻中，潜意识将存在于两个大 脑之间，以使这生物以一个单一的统一体来运作。同时，这也是最难解释的部 分，没有一张脸能看到另一个世界。他们觉察不到彼此。然而，每一方都会有充 分的自觉意识。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break again.There is much more to be gone into here.</td><td>我建议再稍作休息。还有很多要研究的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:02.Again, Jane said that she was pretty well dissociated during the above delivery.Resume at 11:06. )</td><td>(11:02 休息。再次的，珍说在上述传述过程中，她解离的状况相当好。11:06 恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>I wanted to begin this material, and we will continue it.I do not like to give you too much difficult material at one session.I would rather let you study what you have.And now, a short chat about your hilarious furniture changings, and recharging's, and rehanging's.</td><td>我想开始谈这个资料，我们也会继续谈下去。我不喜欢在一次课程中给你太多难 以理解的资料。我宁可让你学习你有的东西。现在，我们来聊一聊你那搞笑的家 具更动、再更动、又更动的事。</td></tr><tr><td>The bookcases should stay as they are, my dear Ruburt.Enough is enough, and you have optimum benefit from them.You should feel much better.

"</td><td>在鲁伯做梦的那个当下，你们的朋友卡拉汉小姐已经，或者说正在，决定离开这 个层面。鲁伯直接收到了这个信息。卡拉汉小姐的不情愿离去，当然代表着她当 前人格对这变化的抗拒，她自己更深层的那部分，认为这改变是必要且适当的。</td></tr><tr><td>It was Miss Callahan's discovery that she needed operations on both eyes that caused this deeper decision.Miss Callahan herself was conscious of natural dismay over the projected operations.When she told Ruburt of the operations, Ruburt leapt to the conclusion that this was the meaning of the dream, and that the dream data had been incomplete.</td><td>正是因为卡拉汉小姐发现她的双眼需要手术，才导致了这个更深层次的决定。卡 拉汉小姐自己是意识到，对这预期手术自然带来的沮丧。当她把手术的事情告诉 鲁伯时，鲁伯立刻下了定论，认为这就是那场梦的含意，只不过梦的资料不完整。</td></tr><tr><td>I think that before tonight, subconsciously Ruburt knew the true meaning of the dream.Part of the subconscious fantasy in the dream was of course valid, representing a watered-down version of the actual communication.For example, Miss Callahan's black apparel.She had been preparing herself since she learned of the operations' necessity for her own departure.Yet consciously of course, she was ignorant of her own inner decision, and this is always absolutely necessary.</td><td>我想，在今晚之前，潜意识里，鲁伯是知道这个梦的真实含意的。梦中，部分潜 意识的幻象是有效的，代表着实际通讯的稀释版本。比如，卡拉汉小姐的黑衣 服。她自从得知手术的必要后，一直在为自己的离世做准备。然而在意识上，她 当然对自己内在的决定一无所知，这一点始终是绝对必要的。</td></tr><tr><td>("Seth, why did Miss Callahan tell us back in early December that she didn't know,

many years, as she taught his children.He admired her very much, as his children found her an excellent teacher.One in particular.Frank Watts considered her a friend, attaching more importance than she did to her influence upon his children; but beyond this her present personality has been gently disentangling itself from this plane, and she simply did not remember.</td><td>她并不记得弗兰克·沃茨，尽管他有一定程度的夸张。她教过他的孩子，有好几年，他们确实经常见面。他非常钦佩她，因为他的孩子们都觉得她是一位优秀的老师。尤其是其中一个孩子。弗兰克-沃茨把她视为朋友，比她更重视她对他的孩 子们的影响；但除此之外，她现在的人格一直在悄悄地脱离这个层面，所以她根本不记得。</td></tr><tr><td>Of course, the conscious mind cannot be aware of such important and critical inner decisions.It would break apart in most unpleasant circumstances, disintegrating before the whole self could make necessary preparations.I want to point out here that your friend Miss Callahan is taking an easier way out in one way, and a difficult way out in another.In the long run her way is a better one, however, than the manner chosen by those who prefer a so-called quick death.</td><td>当然，有意识的心智觉知不到如此重要又关键的内在决策。否则在最不愉快的情 况下，在整体自己能够做出必要的准备之前，它就会崩溃瓦解了。我想在这里指 出，你的朋友卡拉汉小姐采取了一个比较容易的出路，而在另一种意义上来说， 也是一条艰难的路。不过，从长远来看，她的方式比那些喜欢所谓快速死亡的人 所选择的方式要好。</td></tr><tr><td>The disentanglement of her present personality has been gradual and gentle.She is focusing less and less upon this plane and will, again gradually, begin to focus upon another plane.She will not, therefore, experience as much shock.There is a period of adjustment after leaving any plane, although your plane involves the most difficulty since the camouflage pattern is unusually rigid.</td><td>她的当前人格一直在逐渐和缓地脱离。她对这个层面的关注越来越少，并将逐渐 地开始关注另一个层面。因此，她不会经历太大的冲击。离开任何一个层面后， 都会有一段适应期，但是你们的层面涉及的困难最大，因为伪装模式异常僵化。</td></tr><tr><td>("You said once

course is worse, since the personality is not entirely focused as a personality, and it must make immediate and critical adjustments of the strongest nature.Death on your plane is a termination but does not involve a new immediately-critical adjustment, since there is a time for rest and a time to catch up, so to speak.</td><td>出生的冲击当然更严重，因为人格并没有完全集中在作为一个人格上，而在出生 时，它必须立即做出性质最强的关键性调整。在你们的层面上，死亡就是结束，没有涉及即时重要的全新调整，因为有一段休息的时间，也有一段补课的时间， 可以这么说。</td></tr><tr><td>You do not have to learn new things at the same time as you are struggling to exist in a strange environment.After death there is no instant struggle, where birth on your plane involves a pressing, agonizing attempt to get one's bearings, and learn new patterns of behavior, when there is no time in your sense really to make any mistakes at all.The termination is always easier, believe it or not, than a beginning under such pressing circumstances as survival on a strange camouflage plane.</td><td>你不需要在一个陌生的环境中，挣扎求生的同时，学习新的事物。死后没有立即 性的竞争，而在你们层面上的出生，则涉及到一个紧迫的、痛苦的尝试，以掌握 自己的方向，还要学习新的行为模式，真的根本没有你们所感知的时间，来容许 自己犯任何错误。不管你信不信，在陌生的伪装层面上，生存在这样紧迫的情况 下，结束总是比开始更容易。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break.</td><td>我建议稍作休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:28.Once again we felt that we had gathered a lot of material in just about half an hour.Jane was fairly dissociated, she said, except when she paused in her pacing to look out one of our living room windows.This window overlooks a very busy intersection, one house away.It was a very cold night, and Jane was intrigued by the patterns that lingering clouds of automobile exhausts left hanging in the air.Resume at 9:32, Jane dictating.)</td><td>(9:28 休息。我们再次感到，在短短的半个小时内，我们就已经收集了大量的资料。珍说，除了在踱步时，停顿在我们客厅的窗户向外看的时间之外，一直相当 解离。这扇窗户俯瞰着只有一屋之隔的繁忙十字路口。那是一个非常寒冷的夜 晚，珍被汽车排气的烟雾悬在空中形成的图案所吸引。9:32 恢复，珍继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>From your viewpoint such a disintegration is, of course, not pleasant, but as the personality loses its focus on your plane it gathers itself together on another plane, and such a gradual gathering together is much more favorable than the surprise of a complete and sudden departure.Already Miss Callahan's vital core of awareness is appearing on another plane, and if you will forgive an analogy, she appears there as a wondering but not frightened young girl.</td><td>从你们的观点来看，这样的解体当然是不愉快的，但当人格失去了在你们层面上 关注时，它会在另一个层面上把自己凝聚起来，这种逐渐聚集在一起的情况，比 猝然彻底离去的惊讶要有利得多。卡拉汉小姐至关重要的意识核心正出现在另一 个层面上，请允许我打一个比方，她在那里以一个疑惑但不惊慌的年轻女孩的样 貌出现。</td></tr><tr><td>("Is Frank Watts aware of what's happening to Miss Callahan?")</td><td>("弗兰克-沃茨知道卡拉汉小姐发生了什么吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Frank Watts is not yet aware of this, but shortly will be.His powers are not yet developed enough, even here, so that he can be aware of this until she is almost completely materialized.</td><td>弗兰克-沃茨尚不知情，但很快就会知道。他的能力还没有发展到足够的程度，即 使是在这里，所以要到她几乎完全具体化之后，他才能觉察到这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>I have mentioned that the emotions, if you will forgive me, are the tail end of the inner senses.Frank Watts would be aware of the approaching death of a previous child, for example, though not of the approaching death of Miss Callahan at this time.He has been resting.For a while his energies were directed toward your plane in a strong, almost compulsive personal manner, and had Miss Callahan been ill then he would have known.</td><td>我曾提过，对不起我这么说，情绪是内在感官的尾巴。比如说，弗兰克-沃茨可以 觉察到他前一个孩子的死亡逐渐逼近，但此时则没意识到卡拉汉小姐死亡的接 近。他一直在休息。有一阵子，他的能量是以一种强烈的、几乎是强迫性的个人方式转向你们的层面，要是卡拉汉小姐生病了，那他会知道的。</td></tr><tr><td>("Then Miss Callahan will be almost fully materialized on the other plane before she dies on this plane?")</td><td>("那么卡拉汉小姐在这个层面死亡之前，就会在另一个层面几乎完全具体化么？ ")。</td></tr><tr><td>Oh yes.This is the case in her particular type of withdrawal.In a sudden death the materialization is rather shocking for the personality; and the materialization is simultaneously made and leads in some cases to confusion.</td><td>哦，是的。她这特定类型的退出方式，就是如此。在突然死亡的情况下，具体化 对人格来说是相当震惊的；而具体化是同时进行的，并在某些情况下会导致混乱。</td></tr><tr><td>The whole self slowly regains knowledge of its own reincarnations, and learns of its relationship to its own entity.I have said that a personality may become another entity.There is no rule against it.It is a matter of inherent strength and ability and also of desire.Many personalities upon receiving knowledge of their entity prefer to remain part of it, though they are always independent individualities within the whole entity, as even the cells of your physical bodies are part of the whole self.</td><td>整体自己会慢慢地重获对自己转世的知识，得知自己与自己存有的关系。我曾说 过，一个人格可以成为另一个存有。没有规定不可以。这是一个内在力量和能力 的问题，也是一个意愿的问题。许多人格在接受了关于其存有的认识后，宁愿保 持是存有的一部分，尽管它们始终是整个存有内的独立个体，就像你身体的细胞 是你整体自己的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>They greet the entity as a son greets his father.There is no coercion involved here, and this is an important point.</td><td>他们迎接存有就像儿子迎接父亲一样。这里不涉及胁迫，这一点很重要。</td></tr><tr><td>("What did you do?")</td><td>("那你做什么呢？")。</td></tr><tr><td>The cells of your physical body incidentally also have their awareness, which may seem minute and insignificant to you, but they make independent decisions upon which you depend in very important degrees.Your term, instinct, is a very unfortunate one, and coined to begin with because you insist that no organism except man has any consciousness.</td><td>你肉体的细胞附带地也有自己的觉知，对你来说可能显得微不足道，但它们会做 出独立的决定，而你在非常重要的程度上依赖于它。你们的术语"本能"是一个非 常遗憾的用语，一开始就创造出了这个词，因为你们坚持认为，除了人之外，任 何有机物都没有意识，</td></tr><tr><td>So-called instinctual actions seem rather automatic to you because they are different from logical thought as you know it.Because for example bees or ants tend to act in a like manner as far as other bees and ants are concerned, because it appears that their actions are as predictable and almost predetermined, man takes it for granted that certain reflexes are absolutes in particular species, and that in any given situation a member of such a species will always react in a certain manner because he cannot help it.</td><td>所谓的本能行为，对你们而言仿佛相当的自动，因为它们与你们所知的逻辑思维 不同。比如说，蜜蜂或蚂蚁，就其与其它蜜蜂或蚂蚁而言，它们的行为趋于一 致，看起来是可预测、几乎是预设的，所以人类就理所当然地认为，某些条件反 射在特定物种中是绝对的，在任何情况下，这种物种的成员总是会以那特定的方 式作出反应，因为他也无能为力。</td></tr><tr><td>This is the case, but not the case.The choices are small to your way, but choice is not impossible.Actually there is choice, but the manipulation of camouflage is not developed along your lines.This does not mean that there is no consciousness in such species, nor does it mean there is no self-consciousness.There is, to a limited degree.</td><td>情况是这样，但也非真的如此。你的方式，选择的余地很小，但选择并非不可 能。其实是有选择的，但伪装的操作并没有按照你的方式发展。这并不意味着这 种物种没有意识，也不意味着没有自身意识。有，只是程度有限。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, so do the cells in your own body have self-consciousness and individuality to some extent, and so on a different scale entirely do they make decisions.Their decisions affect you, though they have but vague awareness that you exist as a whole at all.Their decisions indirectly affect your manipulations of camouflage, and of course directly influence your whole state of being.The cells are developed to the fullest at this time.</td><td>你自己身体内的细胞在一定程度上也有自身意识和个性，所以在另一个完全不同 的尺度上，它们也在做决定。它们的决定影响着你，虽然它们只是模糊地意识到你作为一个整体存在。它们的决定间接影响着你对伪装的操控，当然也直接影响 着你的整个存在状态。细胞在这个时候得到最充分的发展。</td></tr><tr><td>("What happens when a cancer cell starts up?")</td><td>("当癌细胞启动时，会发生什么？")。</td></tr><tr><td>The cells are independent, as they are individuals.They are also dependent upon the driving organization of your subconscious, following its directions even to cancerous reproductions, which on their part is of course growth.</td><td>细胞是独立的，因为它们是个体。它们也依赖你潜意识的驱动组织，并遵循它的 指示，甚至对癌细胞的繁殖也是如此，这对它们来说，当然就是正常的生长。</td></tr><tr><td>You as a physical being are also dependent upon many forces that you do not understand, so there is no contradiction in saying that the cells are individual and independent, and yet dependent upon stronger organization.There is no coercion put upon the cells, because each cell is what it is because of its innate ability and strength.Nor is there any coercion as far as a personality is concerned, which is a part of an entity.There are laws of development, which are the only real laws, and which govern such matters.Or really, such matters govern themselves.When capabilities grow there are ways of further growth which become open.</td><td>你作为一个肉身的存在，也依赖于很多你不理解的力量，所以说细胞是独立的个 体，却依赖于更强大的组织，这并不矛盾。细胞没有受到任何的胁迫，因为每个 细胞都是因为先天的能力和力量而成为它所是的细胞。就人格而言，也不存在任 何胁迫，它是全有的一部分。有发展的规律，这是唯一真正的规律，它支配着这 些事宜。或者说，这类事务其实就是自己管理着自己。当能力增长时，就会有进 一步增长的途径开放出来。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a break.</td><td>我建议休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:03.Up until near the end of this session, Jane spoke in a voice

different as to be beyond your present comprehension.</td><td>除了其他事项外，你们特定的伪装模式被赋予为固体，而这固体的概念给出了相 对于它的另类概念，亦即不是固体或未被填充的东西，你们称之为空间。你们的 外在感官本身就是你们要处理的伪装，它配备有感知伪装的能力。在其他一些层

应该说，以正式的方式提出建议，你们是否会认为这个建议是合理的。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt, dear Ruburt, has been besieging me with protests because your kitchen is small.Had I realized that your food center was not in one place I would certainly have made this suggestion earlier.I have no intention of disrupting your household, nor as Ruburt feared was this suggestion merely a trick of his own subconscious.You will not be plagued certainly with furniture-moving ideas of this type.</td><td>鲁伯，亲爱的鲁伯，因为你的厨房太小，所以一直围着我抗议。如果我早知道你 们的食品中心不在同一个地方，我早就会提出这个建议。我无意扰乱你们的家 务，而这也不是鲁伯所担心的，以为这个建议是自己潜意识里的把戏。你们肯定 不会被移动家具这类的想法所困扰。</td></tr><tr><td>I found you in certain physical circumstances, some of which were psychically unfavorable, but before a mutual trust was developed I could hardly make any such suggestions.That is why they came all at once so to speak.And they will not keep coming.</td><td>我发现你们处在某种物质环境中，其中一些地方在灵性上是不利的，但在我们的 互信尚未建立之前，我很难提出这类的建议。可以这么说，这就是为什么建议一 股脑地全来了。这些建议不会持续来的。</td></tr><tr><td>The fact is that regardless, Ruburt, of the smallness of your kitchen, it simply is not physically sanitary or even psychically healthful to keep food in a bathroom.Naturally the refrigerator should be kept in one place.You just happened to chose the worst possible place.</td><td>鲁伯，事实上，不管你们的厨房有多小，把食物放在卫生间里，在生理上就是不 卫生，甚至在灵性上也是不健康的。自然，要有一个位置放冰箱。你恰巧选了一 个最糟糕的地方。</td></tr><tr><td>This involvement or seeming involvement in your personal habits is somewhat ludicrous.However I know that the change will be beneficial to a rather important degree.Joseph's gumboils are infections directly connected with the proximity of the refrigerator to more personal cleansing centers, and these centers should certainly be divided.</td><td>这种涉入或者说似乎干预到你们的个人习惯，是有点可笑。然而我知道，这种改 变将有莫大的好处。约瑟的牙龈溃疡是一种感染，这与冰箱太靠近个人的盥洗中 心有直接关系，这些盥洗中心当然应该要区隔开来。</td></tr><tr><td>Far from any constant suggestions on my part as to changes, I am trying to the contrary to set you up in the most beneficial ways possible so that these constant readjustments will not be necessary.</td><td>关于改变，我不会一直提出建议，相反，我正试图以最有利的方式为你们安排， 以便不必不断的重新调整。</td></tr><tr><td>The sleeping room should always be separate.The food preparation centers should always be separate, and you do have room for those facilities in one place.The bathroom is one of your more fortunate environments.You are extremely well off in this respect and the room should be a place of cleansing and even of rest.You do not understand pollution or growth well enough yet, but food simply should not be allowed in this room.I should think that with your educations you should have known this yourselves, and I am quite honestly embarrassed for having to tell you this.</td><td>卧室始终应该是隔开的。食物料理中心也应该是隔开的，你们确实也有空间将这 些设备放在同一个地方。浴室是你比较庆幸的环境之一。在这方面的条件非常 好，这一间应该是一个盥洗甚至是可以休息的地方。你们对污染和生长了解得还 不够，但食物根本就不应该放置在浴室里。我认为，以你们的教育程度，你们早 就该知道这道理，说实话，必须告诉你们这一点，我也很不好意思。</td></tr><tr><td>My mention of the tree in the kitchen was made because I happen to enjoy seeing it when Ruburt makes his twice-weekly journeys up and down the living room floor.A tree is a living symbol to you Joseph, but I certainly do not insist that the tree be left uncovered though personally I see no reason why any other changes have to be made in the kitchen, except for the addition of the refrigerator.I blush to think of your fine professors reading this, and for your sakes I suggest that it not be sent out with official material.</td><td>我之所以提到厨房那棵树，是因为当鲁伯每周两次在客厅地板来回踱步时，我恰 好会看到也很欣赏。对你来说，树是一个活生生的象征，约瑟，但我不会坚持树 不能被遮住，不过我个人认为，除了增加一台冰箱之外，没有理由在厨房里做任 何其他改变。想到你们的优秀教授读到这份记录，我就会脸红，为了你们，我建 议不要把它和正式资料一起发出去。</td></tr><tr><td>("Okay."</td><td>("好的。"</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth's reference to a tree concerns one I had drawn directly on the kitchen wall, in India ink on the yellow paint.It happened to be one of my best drawings, done very quickly above the spot where we had placed the small refrigerator.One can look into the kitchen from one end of the living room and thus see the tree, and in a subdued light it is very effective.The big refrigerator covers it entirely since it is the only spot in the kitchen where it will fit in at all.Jane used this fact in protesting to Seth about switching the iceboxes.)</td><td>(赛斯提到的树，是我用墨水直接画在厨房的黄色漆墙上。刚好也是我画得最好的 画作之一，完成的非常快，就在我们放小冰箱那个位置的上方。从客厅的一端望向厨房，就可以看到这画在墙上的这棵树，在柔和的光线下，效果非常好。大冰箱如果放在厨房这唯一能放得下它的地方，就会把树完全挡住了。珍用这个事实向赛斯抗议调换冰箱的事。)</td></tr><tr><td>I made the suggestion impromptu simply because I was suddenly aware of the condition that needed a remedy.These changes in your physical situation, believe it or not, will save you both some psychic difficulties and even physical ills.Otherwise I would have made no suggestions.</td><td>我临时提出这个建议，只是因为我突然意识到这个状况需要补救。你们这些实际 情况的改变，不管你信不信，将为你们俩省去一些灵性上的困难、甚至身体上的 麻烦。否则，我也不会提出任何建议。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, I certainly hope that much is settled and that Ruburt will stop blatting at me.He keeps going at me more than I ever keep going at him between sessions, and he is just getting too good at it.</td><td>现在，我真的希望很多事情都解决了，也希望鲁伯别再对我唠叨了。他一直冲着 我嘀咕，比我在课余时冲着他念叨的次数还要多，他变得越来越擅长此道了。</td></tr><tr><td>Your living spaces should be divided as to function.This avoids entanglement of psychic energies, and I will go into the reasons for this during one of our regular sessions.Now dear pigeons it is a lovely evening, I see.These physical changes will make your life more peaceful and set you both at peace in various ways.</td><td>你们的生活空间应该按照功能来划分。这样可以避免心灵能量的纠缠，我将在一 次定期课上探讨其原因。现在，亲爱的鸽子们，我看这是一个美好的夜晚。这些 物质上的变化会让你们的生活更加平静，让你们俩在各方面都得到安宁。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have any questions, Joseph?</td><td>你有什么问题吗，约瑟？</td></tr><tr><td>("Why does my wife's back hurt?")</td><td>("为什么我妻子的背会痛？")</td></tr><tr><td>Your wife's back trouble is a matter of tension, and a chiropractic adjustment will doubtless help.Emotional and psychic changes sometimes sweep her willy-nilly, with the changes from winter to spring having to do with chemical rather than glandular adjustments.It is nothing serious and I will also cover the reasons behind her particular variety of seasonal difficulties at a later time, when I go into her past lives.</td><td>你妻子的背部问题是紧张的问题，脊椎按摩调整无疑会有帮助。情绪和心理的变 化有时会横扫过她，冬天到春天的季节交替的变化与化学性调整有关而非腺体。这并不严重，等我以后讨论她过去生命的时候，也将会涵盖她各种季节性问题背 后的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>I will leave you now. There is a possibility that Ruburt's eyesight may improve with a chiropractic adjustment.Per usual I could go on for hours, but I will not keep you.</td><td>我现在要走了，鲁伯的视力有可能会在脊椎按摩后得到改善。和往常一样，我可 以说上几个小时，但我不耽误你们的时间了。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth."</td><td>("晚安，赛斯。")</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 6:00 PM.</td><td>(下午 6:00 结束。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth's observation that it was a lovely evening stemmed from the fact that night had not yet fallen.Usually our sessions take place when it is quite dark out.)</td><td>(赛斯注意到今晚夜色很美，是因为夜幕还没有降临。)平常我们的课都是天色很 暗才开始。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 31</td><td>第 31 节 起源和存有</td></tr><tr><td>MARCH 2, 1964 MONDAY 9 PM AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964 年 3 月 2 日 星期一 晚上 9 点 按指示</td></tr><tr><td>(Again this session took place without the board.As early as 8:35 Jane felt somewhat nervous.At 8:45 she had "no idea what he's going to talk about tonight."

reassured.</td><td>我不知道如果你们不用显灵板，鲁伯在课前是比较不那么紧张，还是更紧张。经 过这么多节课，我想他应该会放心了。</td></tr><tr><td>In the back of your mind is one question that I have avoided for many reasons.One of the main reasons for my avoiding it was the necessity of giving prerequisite material so that the answer would be at least partially comprehensible.</td><td>在你们的脑海中，有一道题我一直在回避，原因很多。回避它的一个主要原因 是，我必须先提供一些先决条件的资料，这样你们至少可以理解部分的答案。</td></tr><tr><td>The question has to do with the so-called creation of your universe, the introduction of entities upon it, and of course with the cause or causes behind such creation.You know by now that you create your own camouflage-patterned universe, and I have tried to cover some of the mechanisms involved in this continuous, seemingly automatic creation.</td><td>这个问题与你们所谓的宇宙的创造有关，以及由宇宙创造而引入的存有，当然还 有导致这种创造背后的原因或多个原因。你们现在已经知道，你们创造了你们自 己的伪装模式的宇宙，我已经试图解释了一些涉及这种持续的、似乎是自动创建 的一些机制。</td></tr><tr><td>If this were fully understood you see, then there would not be the necessity of looking for some god.I am certainly not going into the God concept at this time, though you can be certain that I will cover it thoroughly, since it is itself an idea camouflage covering something much different.</td><td>如果完全理解了这一点，那么就没有必要去寻找什么神了。我当然不打算在这个 时候去深谈上帝的概念，但可以肯定，我会彻底地谈论它，因为它本身就是一个 意念伪装，掩盖着某个大不相同的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>You know then that you yourselves create your universe and that each generation creates it anew in its own image.There is a growth principle operating in the realm of ideas and in the construction of these ideas into camouflage patterns.</td><td>那么，你就知道，是你们自己创建了自己的宇宙，并且每一代都按照自己的意象 重新创建它。在意念的领域之内、以及在这些意念建构成伪装模式的过程里，有 一种成长原则在运作。</td></tr><tr><td>The patterns evolve according to certain laws.They merely reflect the ideas behind them, and these ideas you must realize originate from different sources.They originate in the subconscious, it is true, but before this an idea quality is received by the inner senses.Sometimes this idea quality is received as intuition, where it sparks into the conscious mind.But the conscious ego is the primary manipulator of camouflage patterns and the obvious mover.The actual material from which camouflage patterns are formed is the vitality which exists and which is unconsciously used by your personalities.</td><td>这些模式按一定的规律而演化。它们只是反映了其背后的意念，但你必须明白， 这些意念源自不同的来源。它们源自潜意识，这是事实，但在此之前，意念的性 质被内在感官接收。有时，这个意念的性质是以直觉的形式被接收，它灵光乍现 地进入有意识的心智。但有意识的自我是伪装模式的主要操纵者和显然的推动 者。形成伪装模式的实际材料是生命力，它存在，并且，被你的人格无意识地利 用着。</td></tr><tr><td>This actual gathering up of prime vitality for the purpose of physical construction is not however truly automatic, and it is not truly performed unconsciously.The strong self-conscious self of which I have spoken, the self-conscious self of which your own personality is not aware, this self that faces into the inner world of reality, quite consciously draws upon the vitality and stuff of what is.</td><td>然而，为了物质建构的目的，首要生命力的实际汇聚，并非真是自动的，也不是 真的无意识地进行的。我所讲过的有强大自身意识的自己，你自己人格并未觉察 的这个有自身意识的自己，这个面对内在的实相世界的自己，在相当有意识地汲 取生命力、以及它的材料。</td></tr><tr><td>The conscious ego then manipulates this material for the purposes of camouflage constructions.The transformation of vitality into physical properties is done by this self-conscious self that faces the inner world.The subconscious is the link between these two self-consciousness, and here you find an acceptance by the camouflage personality of the materials at hand.</td><td>然后有意识的自我会操控这材料来达到伪装建构的目的。生命力转化为物质属性 是由这个面对内在世界的有自身意识的自己所完成。潜意识连接着这两种自身意 识，在这里你会发现手头的材料被伪装人格所接受。</td></tr><tr><td>At the same time the camouflage consciousness cannot be aware of the actual originator, and therefore must look for causes from the outside.In your dual system, that is, the two self-consciousness are more divided and alien to themselves than need be.The old idea of spirits pervading all physical matter actually represents an intuitive glimpse into reality that your sciences will finally arrive at in a long labored manner.</td><td>同时，伪装意识不能意识到实际的肇端，因此必须从外部寻找原因。在你们的双 重体系中，也就是说，两种自身意识比原本所会有的更加区隔和陌生。万物有灵 的古老观念，其实代表着对实相的直觉性的一瞥，而这是你们的科学终将以一个 漫长的艰苦方式到达的。</td></tr><tr><td>You can see now why the problem of creation does not really exist in the terms that you first thought of it.During one session I mentioned that since self-consciousness even exists in all living things, then the question of the exact entrance be specified becomes irrelevant.</td><td>现在你可以明白了，为什么创造的问题其实并不像你最初所想的那样真的存在。有一节我提到过，自身意识甚至存在于所有的生物中，那么指定确切地的源起问 题，就变得不相关了。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a break.</td><td>我建议休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27.Jane was "in between" this time, or but partly dissociated.It seemed that we had not acquired as much material as usual.By the end of her  delivery she was talking a bit louder and at a slightly faster rate.Resume at 9:29. )</td><td>(9:27 分休息。珍这次是"介于中间"，或者说只是部分解离。似乎我们取得的资料没有像平常那么多。传述到最后时，她说话的声音大了一些，语速也稍微快了一 些。9:29 继续)。</td></tr><tr><td>The fact is that your plane originated because enough entities needed certain types of experience to warrant such a creation, and they set about forming it through the process of evolution.That I believe you understand.The smallest minute first portion represented the will and vitality of all the entities that would ever dwell upon the earth that would come after.</td><td>事实是，你们的层面起源于足够多的存有需要某些类型的经验来确保这样的创 造，他们开始通过演化的过程来形成它。这一点我相信你是明白的。最微小的初 始部分代表了之后将居住在地球上的所有存有的意志和生命力。</td></tr><tr><td>It was far from a purposeless arrangement.It involved a foresight hardly imaginable, and I repeat that you had your part in the initial reaction, as did every entity who lived or will live upon the earth; and here we are getting into something rather difficult but certainly no mystery.</td><td>这绝不是一个毫无目的的安排。它涉及到一种难以想象的先见之明，我再说一 遍，在初始的反应中，就有你这一部分的参与，如同每一个生活在或将生活在地 球上的存有一样；这里，我们正要涉入一些相当艰深，但绝非神秘的事情。</td></tr><tr><td>I hope I will be able to make this entirely comprehensible at some future time.Nevertheless I will state a few matters now and you will understand them more fully in later sessions.</td><td>我希望将来，我能够使这一点完全得到理解。不过，我现在要说明几件事，你们 在以后的课程中将会更全面地理解它们。</td></tr><tr><td>Since all entities had a hand in when the first particle of matter came into physical materialization, then the inference is plain that entities not yet born upon your planet somehow existed then, and this is the case.You are familiar I am sure with the old religious Christian dictum that God always was and always will be, and this is considered a religious mystery.The fact is that entities always were and always will be, though not necessarily in the same form.</td><td>既然所有的存有都参与了物质的第一个粒子进入实体化的过程，那么可以很清楚 地推论，还没有在你们的星球上出生的存有，在当时就以某种方式存在了，情况 就是这样。你一定很熟悉古老的基督教箴言，上帝始终存在，也将永远存在，这 被认为是一个宗教的奥秘。事实是，存有始终存在，也将永远存在，但未必是以 同样的形式。</td></tr><tr><td>This involves on the part of the entity the use of personalities, which are in a manner capsules of itself or even compartmentsâpart of the whole entity but neatly divided as far as memory and so forth is concerned.Nor is this the only universe which you have helped construct.This is rather difficult but you will see that it is really quite logical.</td><td>这涉及到存有对人格的运用，在某种程度上，俨然成了自身的胶囊，甚至是隔间—人格是整个存有的一部分，但就记忆等方面而言，是被整齐地划分开的。这也 不是你唯一协助构建的宇宙。这是相当难以理解的，但你会发现，这真的很符合 逻辑。</td></tr><tr><td>When your friend Philip innocently asked at what point human consciousness entered the picture, his question was not pertinent.Human consciousness involves entity consciousness, and entity consciousness asserted itself at the very first phase of physical materialization.</td><td>当你的朋友菲利普天真地问到，在什么时候人类的意识进入了这个画面，他的问 题并不贴切。人类意识涉及到存有意识，而存有意识在实体化的最初阶段就宣称 了自己。</td></tr><tr><td>("Does this include the actual physical construction of the earth itself Or are you referring to the beginnings of life upon an earth already in existence?")</td><td>("这是否包括地球本身实际的物质建构，或者你指的是，已经存在的地球上的生 命起源？")。</td></tr><tr><td>That includes constructing the earth itself, and when I spoke of the first particle I referred to the very first materialization of physical matter, period.It was this first particle before earth had its form to which I referred when saying that it was the result of the will of all the entities who would ever be born upon it.</td><td>这包括建构地球本身，当我谈到第一个粒子时，我指的是物质最初的具体化，就 是这样。我在说地球是所有将在地球上诞生的存有的意志的结果时，提到的那个 在地球尚未有其形态之前的那第一个粒子。</td></tr><tr><td>The laws of evolution were self-limiting laws in one respect, but involve a necessary discipline in formation.The fact that entities always existed and always will exist sounds strange or even impossible simply because of your present perspective.Even your small studies with psychological time should give you some valuable insight into this matter, however, and the use of psychological time is very important because of the avenues which it will open for you.</td><td>进化的规律在某方面是自限性规律，但涉及到形成的必要纪律。存有始终存在并 将永远存在，这听起来很奇怪，甚至不可能，这只是由你目前的观点认为的。即使你用心理时间稍微研究一下，也能给你一些有价值的洞察，心理时间的运用非 常重要，因为它将为你打开多个渠道。</td></tr><tr><td>If you use psychological time as I have told you, you will get immediate firsthand experience of many facets of reality which take me pages to explain with the indirect use of words.All entities basically are self-aware portions of energy or vitality.They are self-generating and there is no possibility of thinking in terms of either beginning or end.Again, it is only your own camouflage- imprisoned data which makes you think that everything has a beginning and an end.</td><td>如果你像我告诉你的那样去应用心理时间，你就会对实相的许多方面获得当下的 第一手体验，而这些需要我间接地用上好几页的文字来解释。所有的存有们基本 上都是能量或生命力的自觉部分。它们是自生的，没有可能以开始或结束的说法 去思考。还是那句话，是你们那被伪装所束缚的资讯，让你们认为一切都有开始 和结束。</td></tr><tr><td>(By now Jane's delivery had speeded up to its usual rate.)</td><td>(现在珍的传述已经加快到平常的速度。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will go into this also more deeply later.It is obvious by now that entities on any plane create that plane, and a strong portion of their personalities are similarly constructed to deal with the mechanics of the particular plane.</td><td>我以后还会更深入地探讨这个问题。现在已经很明显了，是每一个层面上的存有 们创造了它们所在的那个层面，他们人格中的绝大部分也以类似的方式被建构出 来，以便应对那特定层面的机制。</td></tr><tr><td>In a very simple example, consider that you yourself use your own energy to create your dream world.In this way also you create your so-called real camouflage world, the only difference being that the dream world images do not have duration in physical time although they have duration in psychological time.And believe it or not, actually your individuality has much more freedom in the creation of your dream world, and this is the reason why the dream world does not appear consistent to others.</td><td>举一个非常简单的例子，假设一下你自己用自己的能量来创造你的梦境。你也通 过这种方式，创造了你所谓的真实的伪装世界，唯一不同的是，梦境世界的影像 在心理时间上有持续期间，但在物理时间中却不会持续。而不管你信不信，其实 你的个体性在创造你的梦境世界时有更大的自由度，这就是为什么梦境世界显得 不一致的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>In the creation of the physical world a certain giving up of individuality is absolutely necessary, since the overall material environment must appear more or less the same to everyone.Of course it will never appear absolutely the same, but it must have a fairly dependable overall coherence.</td><td>在创造物质世界的过程中，某种程度的放弃个体性是绝对必要的，因为总体的物 质环境对每个人来说都必须显得大致相同。当然，它永远不会出现绝对的相同， 但它必须有一个相当可靠的整体一致性。</td></tr><tr><td>I

somehow the idea that all entities were in existence at the time of the creation of the earth shocked her.</td><td>(9:56 休息。从上次休息到这次休息之间，我们获得的资料量似乎很正常。珍的解离也相当好。她说，不知何故，所有的存有在创造地球时就已存在的这个思想令她震惊。</td></tr><tr><td>(A few days ago, while doing some painting, the idea had popped into my conscious mind unbidden that the very act of painting a picture involved the construction of a plane.I had mentioned it to Jane at the time.Resume at 10:03. )</td><td>(几天前，在作画的时候，我的脑海里不经意地冒出一个想法，就是画画的行为本 身就涉及到层面的建构。我当时就跟珍说了。10:03 继续)。</td></tr><tr><td>Incidentally, your universe was not created by all entities, but only by the entities that needed a particular kind of experience.The fact that manipulation is important upon your plane is one of the main causes for wars.</td><td>顺便一提，你们的宇宙不是由全部的存有共同创造，而只是由需要某种特定经验 的存有所创造。在你们的层面上，操控是重要的，这个事实正是战争的主要原因 之一。</td></tr><tr><td>("Seth, what do you mean exactly when you use the word universe?Are you referring to just our own solar system?"</td><td>("赛斯，你用宇宙这个词到底是什么意思？你指的只是我们的太阳系吗？"</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth's following answer, through Jane, tallied so closely with the words forming in my own mind that once again, as in the 28th session, I wondered if telepathy might be involved, as in the case of John Bradley.)</td><td>(通过珍，赛斯下面的回答，与我脑海中形成的文字非常吻合，以至于我又一次像 在第 28 节课那样，怀疑这是否像约翰-布拉德利的情况一样，涉及到心灵感应。)</td></tr><tr><td>By universe I mean physical systems.That is, all you can see now are physical systems.I am speaking of the universe in your terms, as even being all that your telescopes can pick up.In a way your knowledge is limited to physical systems.I am speaking of the stars and planets you see in your sky, but not of the invisible systems that may exist simultaneously with them.</td><td>我说的宇宙是指物质系统。也就是说，你们现在能看到的都是物质系统。我是用 你们的术语谈宇宙，甚至包括所有你们的望远镜所能观察到的。在某种程度上， 你们的知识仅限于物质系统。我说的是你们在天空中看到的恒星和行星，但不是 指可能与它们同时存在的那看不见的系统。</td></tr><tr><td>War does not exist on other planes.It exists on your plane as a byproduct of certain challenges which the creator-entities wished to solve through materialization.I have known that these questions were on your minds.</td><td>战争不存在于其他层面。仅存在于你们的层面，是创造的存有们希望通过具体化 来解决某些挑战时所产生的副产品。我早就知道你脑海中有这些问题。</td></tr><tr><td>I would like to go back to the difference between the dream world and the outside camouflage world again.</td><td>我想再回来谈谈梦境世界和外在伪装世界的差异。</td></tr><tr><td>The self-conscious self on the other side of the subconscious has a freer hand in the creation of your dreams, since you are the only personality to whom they must be comprehensible.The camouflage world must be dependable, therefore you do not have such individualistic freedom.</td><td>在潜意识另一边的有自身意识的自己，在创造你的梦境时有很大的自由，因为这 些梦只须对你这一个人格来说是能够被理解的。伪装世界必须可靠，因此你没有 这种表达个性的自由。</td></tr><tr><td>Those who have extremely strong hidden self-conscious selves have the need for greater use of individuality, and these people therefore create what could be called another plane in waking hours, through the use of art forms.</td><td>那些有极端强大的隐藏的自觉意识的个体们，需要更多地发挥个人性，因此这些 人在醒时，通过艺术形式的运用，创造出可谓另一个层面。</td></tr><tr><td>("I thought so.")</td><td>("我也这么认为。")。</td></tr><tr><td>In the creation of art forms, both self-consciousness are allowed with certain reservations to work together.The subconscious channel between them is allowed to open to a great degree.The product of such merging is extremely individualistic, and yet more comprehensible to others than say a fragment from the dream world.</td><td>在艺术形式的创作中，两种自觉意识都被允许有一定保留地一起工作。在它们之 间的潜意识通道被允许更大程度的开放。这种融合的产物是极富个性的，但又比，比如说，梦境中的一个片段，更容易被他人理解。</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless it also partakes of the strange unity that unites all personalities beneath the camouflage pattern, while at the same time it is only partially connected to the camouflage pattern.In some respects art creations are a meeting of the dream world and the world of camouflage patterns, but in a deeper way art creations represent the appearance or materialization in the actual element of physical time of inner realities.That is, the inner individualistic self forces its vision and knowledge into the world of camouflage pattern, giving its dreams a physical reality denied to the usual dream.And here the use of energy for this purpose is conscious, that is the strong hidden self actually makes use of the camouflage conscious self and molds the two into a reality that combines two planes.This I hope will become clear as you read it over.</td><td>然而，它也参与了那奇特的统合，这统合联结了在伪装模式下的所有人格，同时 它只部分地连接到伪装模式。艺术创作是梦世界和伪装模式世界的相遇，但更深 层的是，艺术创作代表了内在实相的实际元素在物理时间内的出现或物化。也就是说，内在个人性的自己将自己的意象和知识强行加入到伪装模式的世界，赋予 它的梦一个通常的梦所没有的物质实相。而这里的能量使用是有意识的，也就是 那强大的隐藏的自己，实际上是使用了伪装意识的自己，并将两者塑成一个结合 两个层面的实相。这一点希望你看完后能变得清楚明白。</td></tr><tr><td>The act of artistic creation is therefore one to study, since it involves the intricate workings of the dual self-consciousness of one personality, inner data being transformed through the subconscious and greater individuality being made possible because of this.</td><td>因此，艺术创作的行为是值得研究的，因为它涉及到一个人格的双重自身意识的 复杂运作，内在资讯透过潜意识来转换，更大的个体性因此成为可能。</td></tr><tr><td>You were quite correct, Joseph, in your feeling that art created another plane, and now let me hit you with this one: that the paintings of an artist to some degree have a consciousness of their own, not imprisoned either by the form itself.</td><td>约瑟，你觉得艺术创造了另一个层面，这是非常正确的，现在让我用这句话来震 撼你：艺术家的画作，在某种程度上有自己的意识，且不被形式本身所禁锢。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break, and let me congratulate you my dear Joseph upon your latest manipulation of camouflage pattern in terms of your entryway.You will find it very beneficial.It will however mark the end of my suggestions.If possible heed the ones I have already made, but unless queried I will leave your physical situation at rest as it is very much better now.</td><td>"""""""我建议稍作休息，亲爱的约瑟，你最近对伪装模式的操作	指的是你进门处的玄关，我要恭喜你。"""你会发现它非常有益。然而，这将标志着我的建议到此为 止。如果可能的话，也留意我提过的建议，但除非有人问起，否则我就不过问你 们的物质状况了，因为现在情况已经好多了。"</td></tr><tr><td>("Well, I'm quite sure well have

Jane's desk, so that she will have an enclosed working area at one end of our living room next to the windows."</td><td>(10:30 休息。赛斯提到的隔屏是我的一个想法，就是在珍的书桌上装一个小书架，这样她就可以在客厅的一端靠窗的地方有一个圈围出来的工作区。</td></tr><tr><td>(This time Jane was pretty well dissociated.She said that part of her knows when she smokes a cigarette, and part does not.I also asked her why she couldn't sit down and deliver Seth's messages, as well as do so much pacing.The question came up because I thought she was getting tired.Her voice was becoming hoarse.Resume at 10:36. )</td><td>(这一次，珍相当地解离。她说，当她抽烟时，部分的她知道、部分的她不知道。我还问她为什么不能坐下来传递赛斯的信息，以及做这么多的来回踱步。之所以这么问，是因为我觉得她越来越累了。她的声音变得嘶哑。10:36 继续)。</td></tr><tr><td>In the last analysis the channel for vitality or for vitality's transformation into physical matter is of course the inner senses' ability, and there is a counteraction here as far as the conscious ego is concerned.The conscious ego often blocks much energy.In dreams the blocking is minimized.</td><td>归根结底，生命力或生命力转化为物质的渠道，当然是内在感官的能力，就意识 自我而言，这里有一个反作用。有意识的自我常常会阻挡很多能量。在梦中，阻 挡最小。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane sat down to dictate.)</td><td>(现在珍坐着口述。)</td></tr><tr><td>The inner senses operate on all planes and under all circumstances.The outer senses vary according to plane and circumstance.The outer senses are dependable only in terms of the definite plane for which they were constructed.Their purpose of course is to enable the conscious personality to recognize as valid camouflage patterns which are only valid under certain conditions.</td><td>内在感官运作于所有的层面和任何情况。外在感官则按层面和环境的不同而有变 化。外在感官只有在它们被建构出来的那个层面上才是可靠的。它们的目的当然 是为了让有意识的人格能识别出那些只在特定条件下才有效的伪装模式。</td></tr><tr><td>On your particular kind of culturally organized grouping the camouflage is necessarily strong, and the outside senses correspondingly vivid.This of course is bound to block some inner data.At the same time it is the inner vitality which creates the camouflage to begin with.Joseph was right when he spoke of entities creating stages upon which to act out their problems.The point of course being that once the play begins the actors are so completely immersed in their roles that they forget that they themselves wrote the play, constructed the sets, or are even acting.The reason for this is rather apparent.</td><td>在你们这种特定的文化上的组织群体，伪装性必然很强，外部感官的觉受也相应 生动鲜活。当然这必然会阻挡一些内在的资讯。同时，一开始就是内在的生命力 在创造伪装。约瑟说的没错，他说存有创造了舞台，在此基础上演出他们的问 题。当然，问题的关键在于，一旦这出戏开始，演员们就完全沉浸在自己的角色 中，以至于他们忘了是他们自己写的剧本，布置的场景，甚至是自己在演戏。原 因是相当明显的。</td></tr><tr><td>If you know that a situation is imaginary you are not going to bother trying to solve it.This way you have your actors taking the situation as it seems to be, but looking about in some amazement now and then to wonder how they got where they are, who constructed the stage and so forth.They do not realize that the whole thing is self-created nor should they in the main, since the urgency to solve problems would dissolve.</td><td>如果你知道一个情境是虚构的，你就不会费心地去解决它。以这种方式，你的演 员们就会按照看起来的样子来表演，并不时惊讶地四处环顾，不知道他们是如何 走到这一步，是谁搭建的舞台等等。他们并没有意识到整个剧情是自己创造的， 他们也不应该是主角，否则解决问题的迫切性便会消解。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane laughed.And here again, she proceeded to immediately answer the question that came to my mind.)</td><td>(这时珍笑了。此时再次地，她又立即回答了我脑海中的问题。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am not worried that I am going to disturb the balance that exists, far from it.The fact is that realization to some degree can come and often does come after the play is well under way, and at this point the camouflage action is so involved that the realization itself appears in the framework of the camouflage, and is often indistinguishable from it.</td><td>我并不担心自己会破坏现有的平衡，远非如此。事实上，觉悟在某种程度上是可 以出现的，而且往往是在剧情进行到一定程度之后才出现，这时伪装行为是如此 的投入，以至于觉悟本身出现在伪装的框架内，而且往往与伪装混淆难以区分。</td></tr><tr><td>Art creations represent such an awareness, but here the creation of another plane must be intertwined with the camouflage pattern with which you are involved.That is, paintings would have no reality in your present stage of development as long as they remained simply in your mind, even to you.You are driven to give them "reality," and put that word in quotes, through materializing them in terms of camouflage pattern.You do this to the best of your ability, but in order for the painting to have a reality in your world it must be materialized to some degree on the physical plane.</td><td>艺术创作代表了这样一种觉知，但在这里，另一个层面的创造必须与你所参与的 伪装模式交织在一起。也就是说，只要绘画仅仅停留在你的脑海中，以你目前发 展的阶段，它们不会有实相，这甚至对你也是如此。在伪装模式上，你被驱使着 通过具体化给它们"实相"，把实相这个词加上引号。你尽你最大的能力这样做， 但为了让画作在你们的世界里有一个实相，它必须在某程度上在物质层面被具体 化。</td></tr><tr><td>Art creation is a most basic creation then, not even a mimicking act but a genuine creation of another plane, done self-consciously from the perspective of an imprisoning camouflage pattern.Quite an achievement, therefore.It should be simple as an analogy to consider the next point, where the figure in a painting would not only have a certain consciousness for example but would have other freedoms also; and this would give you a limited conception of what is involved in the creation of other planes of more varied scope.</td><td>那么，艺术创作是一种最基本的创造，它甚至不是一种模仿的行为，而是从一个 禁锢性的伪装模式的角度，自觉地完成另一个层面的真正的创造。因此，是相当 不错的成就。作为一个类比来想下面这一点，应该就很容易了，比如说，画中的人物不仅有，比方说，一定的意识，而且也有其他的自由；这将使你对创造各式 各样的其他层面所涉及的内容有一个有限的概念。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break.</td><td>我建议稍作休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:00.Jane was by now quite tired.She delivered most of the above material sitting down.Her voice was lower than usual also.In order to check a bit on whether any telepathy was involved between us, I told Jane I had a question I wanted to ask Seth, but was not going to voice it, at least not yet.</td><td>(11:00 休息。珍现在已经很累了。她坐着传述以上大部分资料。她的声音也比平时低沉。为了查验一下我们之间是否有心灵感应，我告诉珍我有个问题想问赛斯，但不打算说出来，至少现在不说。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane remained seated when we resumed at 11:05.)</td><td>(11:05

Seth-Jane began the following monologue, for as soon as it began Jane got to her feet and resumed pacing.At the end of the session Jane said she got to her feet because she felt very dissociated sitting down; she was talking with her eyes closed and felt that she might slip into a trance.She said that Seth didn't care about her position.I thought, though, that it was more than coincidence that Jane became more active, considering the subject matter of the next paragraph.)</td><td>(当赛斯-珍开始下面的独白时，我不得不笑了，因为一旦课开始，珍就站了起 来，继续踱步。课程结束时，珍说她之所以站起来，是因为她觉得坐着让她很解 离；她闭着眼睛说话，觉得自己可能会陷入恍惚。她说赛斯并不在意她的位置。不过我想，考虑到下一段的主题，珍变得更加活跃，这不仅仅是巧合。)</td></tr><tr><td>I would also like to really bawl Ruburt out in strongest terms about his smoking habits.This time of year in particular too much smoking is not good; and he knows I was going to say this and blocked me nicely since the beginning of this session.</td><td>我还真想用最强硬的字眼来大骂一下鲁伯的吸烟习惯。特别是每年的这个时候， 抽太多烟不是好事；而且他知道我要说这个，从这节课开始就和善地挡住了我。</td></tr><tr><td>I intend to go into more material about various planes, and soon to give a comprehensive view of the inner senses and their mechanism and

from your ordinary conscious self.</td><td>我打算深入探讨更多关于各种层面的资料，并很快对内在感官及其机制和运作做 一个全面的看法。如果这对你们来说不算太多，那我还想加上这个：内在感官将</td></tr><tr><td>This hidden self-consciousness can also at times look out through

I thought this would interest you in particular, Joseph.</td><td>这种隐藏的自身意识有时也会通过你的外在感官来观察你的伪装世界。在这些时 候，你会得到一些和你通过望远镜看时一样的效果，你可以把望远镜的长镜头想 成潜意识的通道。</td></tr><tr><td>("It does. I'd like to ask you more about this when were not so tired.Now can I change the subject a bit?")</td><td>顺便再提一下，当我提到绘画作品也经历某种意识时，我的意思是在补充说，即 使在你自己的层面上，它们也不是完全没有力量，因为它们确实存在于其内。自 然，它们可以在其中施加影响。我想这会让你特别感兴趣，约瑟。</td></tr><tr><td>If you prefer.</td><td>("确实如此。我想等不那么累的时候，再问你这个问题。现在我可以换个话题了 吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>("Why was Jane so upset about the killing of the starlings at the art gallery by the police over the weekend?

That is although in one way the birds that were killed were meeting a natural end, the reason behind this end was wrong in terms of emotional value and he sensed this.It goes without saying that a bird's death is inevitable, but a cat killing a bird does not have to juggle the same sort of values with which man is concerned.</td><td>("为什么珍对周末警方在画廊射杀欧掠鸟的事这么生气？她今晚针对这件事写了 一首诗，准备寄给报社")。</td></tr><tr><td>I will not go further into this matter this evening.Suffice it to say that to kill for self-protection or even to kill a natural prey on your plane does not involve you in what we may call for the first time, I believe, karmic consequences.</td><td>鲁伯很不高兴，而且理由充分。那就是，虽然从某种角度来说，被杀死的鸟儿是 在遭逢一个自然的结局，但这个结局背后的原因，在情感价值上是错的，他感觉 到了这一点。不用说，鸟儿的死亡是不可避免的，但一只猫杀死一只鸟，却不需 要在人类所关注的那种价值观上玩什么花样。</td></tr><tr><td>To kill for nothing more serious than convenience or to kill for the sake of killing involves rather dire consequences on your plane, and the emotion or emotional value behind such killing is often as important as what is killed.That is the lust for killing is also a matter that brings dire consequences regardless of, in many cases, the particular living thing or things that is killed.This involves value judgments of a very important type and I will not go into them tonight.However I am glad you brought the matter up, as I will use it to carry you into realms that we have not begun to cover.</td><td>今晚，我不会再进一步谈这件事情。我只想说，在你们的层面上，为了自我保护 而杀生，或者，甚至是杀死自然界的猎物，并不会让你卷入，我相信这是我们第 一次用到这个字眼，因果业报。随便乱杀生，或者为了杀生而杀生，在你们层面上涉及到相当严重的后果，而这 种杀生背后的情感或情感价值往往和被杀者一样重要。也就是说，杀戮的欲望也 是一件会带来严重后果的事，在许多情况下，均无关乎被杀的是那种生物或那些 生灵。这涉及到一种非常重要类型的价值判断，今晚我就不多说了。不过，我很 高兴你提到此事，我会借此把你带入我们还没开始涉及的一些领域。</td></tr><tr><td>("Did our cat sense you at the beginning of tonight's session?")</td><td>("今晚的课一开始，我们的猫就感觉到你了吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Your cat sensed me in the beginning of the session.He is however rather acquainted with me now.It takes a while for Ruburt and I to get together so to speak, and at that time I was diffused and he was confused.</td><td>你的猫在一开始就感觉到了我。不过牠现在已经相当熟悉我了。可以这么说，我 和鲁伯也花了一段时间才处在一起，那时，我扩散，他困惑 。</td></tr><tr><td>I am ready to end the session, as I have been trying to watch your time and since Ruburt sends up such mighty shouts if I keep you over.</td><td>我准备结束这一节，因为我一直在留意你们的时间，如果我留你们过久，鲁伯会 张开嗓门大吼。</td></tr><tr><td>One of these nights Ruburt will get his because I will alternate a few sessions of regular material with a few sessions having to do with his present family.</td><td>某个晚上，鲁伯会得到他的，因为我会在几节定期课中交替地讲几节与他现在的 家庭有关的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>And now good night, peaches.Try to keep things on an even keel, and in quiet times remember to experiment with the use of your inner senses.</td><td>现在晚安，桃子们。尽量保持平和的心态，在安静的时刻，记得试着使用你们的 内在感官。</td></tr><tr><td>It is most beneficial for Ruburt to be fairly well self-disciplined this period of the year, for reasons that I will go into later.A quiet schedule is important for him through April at least.Not boredom, dear Ruburt, you don't have to worry.That is, a quiet schedule will help him direct and discipline and use beneficially the sudden spurt of nervous energy which sometimes overwhelms him.</td><td>对鲁伯来说，一年的这段时间里，相当好的自律是最有利的，原因我后面会讲 到。至少在 4 月份之前，一个安定的日程表对他来说很重要。不是无聊，亲爱的鲁伯，你不用担心。就是说，一个安定的日程表有助于他的指向和纪律，以及利 用突然爆发的紧张能量，这能量有时让他难以招架。</td></tr><tr><td>And now Doctor Seth says good night.I won't even request a fee.A most fond good evening to you both.</td><td>现在赛斯医生说晚安了。我甚至不会要求收费。最美好的夜晚，你们两个。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth."</td><td>("晚安 ，赛斯。"</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 11:38.Jane was very tired.She said that toward the end of the session she got the idea that our furniture-moving bout had helped get me through my danger period, which is the last part of winter, and that it had also taken care of her own first springtime burst of energy.)</td><td>(11:38 结束。珍很累。她说，在课程快结束时，她有一个想法，我们移动家具帮助我度过了我的危险期，也就是冬天的最后一段时间，同时也照顾到了她自己春天的第一次能量爆发。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 32</td><td>第 32 节 吸烟,犹太人,敬畏生命</td></tr><tr><td>MARCH 4, 1964 9 PM WEDNESDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964 年 3 月 4 日 晚上 9 点 星期三 按指示</td></tr><tr><td>(At 8:40 PM.Jane left for the corner grocery to get a pack of cigarettes.Actually she had to hurry for the store is several blocks away.It was also raining.Once again Jane had been trying to give up cigarettes; this time the struggle lasted but a day or so, and ended in tears after supper this evening.It appeared to be a panic reaction of some kind, and had happened before.</td><td>(8:40 。珍去街角的杂货店买包烟。因为商店离她有好几个街区，她不得不赶紧。并且天还下着雨。珍再一次尝试戒烟；这次的挣扎只持续了一天左右，今晚 晚餐后，以泪水结束。这似乎是某种恐慌反应，以前也发生过。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was back from the store at 8:55.She said she didn't know what kind of a session we would have, yet by 8:58 she reported that she could "feel him.

evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>First, naturally, I have a few comments to make that will not only tie in Ruburt's smoking habits with his present personality, but also to some extent tie in his present personality with past personalities.</td><td>首先，当然，我有几点意见要提出来，不仅能把鲁伯的吸烟习惯和他现在的人格 联系起来，还能在一定程度上把他现在的人格和过去的人格联系起来。</td></tr><tr><td>His discipline is improving and has improved this life, especially since the ending of the adolescent period.His smoking, dear Joseph, is indulged in for entirely different reasons than those reasons which impelled you to smoke, and the habit is difficult for him to break, though he is breaking it and he has made strides that are important during the past year.</td><td>他这一世的纪律性正在提高，而且已经改善，特别是自从青春期结束以后。亲爱 的约瑟，他耽溺于吸烟的原因与促使你吸烟的原因完全不同，他很难改掉这个习 惯，尽管他正在戒掉它，而在过去一年里，他也已经取得了重要的进步。</td></tr><tr><td>His smoking represents the tail end of a characteristic greediness that besieged him in past lives, with smoking this time as a remnant.The greediness in the past involved many more areas.It included a strong appetite toward stuffing himself with food and drink, and an overall greediness of appetite, even of intellectual and emotional greediness which he has largely overcome.</td><td>他的吸烟代表了过去生中围困他的一种尾大不掉的贪婪特性，这一世的吸烟是一 种残余。过去的贪欲涉及到更多的领域。包括暴饮暴食的强烈食欲，以及总体上 的贪婪胃口，甚至是对智力和情感上的贪欲，不过这部分基本上他已经克服了。</td></tr><tr><td>This time and particularly since adolescence ended he was able to let go the other types of greediness, letting the cigarette take place of all the rest.There is here also what I may call a sort of air panic, an insatiable taking in of air that the nervous puffing of a cigarette sometimes satisfies, even a basis in claustrophobia where the personality feels it is not getting enough air or is closed in.</td><td>这一次，特别是自从青春期结束后，他能够放下其他类型的贪欲，让香烟代替了 所有其他的东西。这里还有一种我可以称之为空气恐慌症，一种对空气的贪得无 厌的摄取，深深地吸口烟有时能满足，它甚至是一种幽闭恐惧症的基础，人觉得 自己得不到足够的空气或被关闭起来。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt even has a latent gluttonous desire for rich foods that he has conquered.Nevertheless although the cigarette habit satisfies these basic old habits, he will be able to let it go.He is a gobbler, that is all.A gobbler of ideas, of emotions, of atmosphere, in some ways a veritable sponge soaking up whatever he can, but he has learned discipline and he is learning a certain amount of patience, which is difficult for him.</td><td>鲁伯甚至对丰富的食物也有一种潜在的贪食欲望，现在已经克服了。不过虽然吸 烟满足了这些基本的老习惯，但他将能够放掉。他是一个狼吞虎咽的人，就是这 样。贪食着思想、情感、气氛的人，在某些方面，他是一块不折不扣的海绵，吸 收着一切可以吸收的东西，但他已经学会了纪律，并正在学习一定程度的耐心， 这对他来说是很难的。</td></tr><tr><td>There is also here connected only with his present personality an ego image of the writer with a cigarette.In this case the cigarette represents independence and even individuality, and even female emancipation.So it is all bound up together in a rather mazelike web.I hope that when Ruburt understands this it will make the situation easier for him.</td><td>这里还有一个只与他当前人格有关的持着烟的作家的自我形象。在这种情况下， 香烟代表着独立甚至是个人性，甚至是女性的解放。所以，这一切都被捆绑在一 起，形成了如迷宫一般的网。我希望当鲁伯明白这一点时，这状况会让他好过一 点。</td></tr><tr><td>As I said it also has to do with a panicky gobbling up of air as if he could never get enough.As a child at one time he died from suffocation, and this also has its bearings here in the present, the panicky gulping of air being a mechanism of subconscious memory.I do hope that this helps him.</td><td>我说过，这也与他恐慌地吞咽空气有关，好像他永远都吸不够。有一世作为一个 孩子，他曾因窒息而死，这与现在恐慌地大口吸气也有关系，慌乱地大口吸气是 潜意识记忆的一种机制。我真的希望这番话对他有帮助。</td></tr><tr><td>I did not intend to go into this any more deeply tonight but it is rather interesting.And he thought he had a foolproof method of gratification, a gratification that seemed to bring no penalties as with overeating and so forth.</td><td>我今晚本来不打算再深谈这部分，但它相当有意思。他以为他有一种万无一失的 方法来满足自己，这种满足感似乎不会像暴饮暴食之类的那样带来惩罚，</td></tr><tr><td>The personality here has been giving as a rule but also took in all it could.I hope that this also answers some questions that you might have had, Joseph, along these lines.</td><td>现在的人格，原则上一直在付出，但也接受了所有能接受的一切。我希望这也回 答了你在这些方面所可能有的一些疑问，约瑟。</td></tr><tr><td>("Did you make the trip to the store with Jane tonight?")</td><td>("你今晚和珍一起去商店了吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>No.  I was aware that she made the trip.These sessions of trying to give up smoking are a definite help and the habit will finally give way.The personality is becoming stronger and will be able to deal with the problem, as in the past it conquered a gluttony toward food and other elements.</td><td>没有，我知道她去了一趟。这几节尝试戒烟的课肯定有帮助，习惯终究会让步。性格正变得更强大，将能够处理这个问题，就像过去它克服了对食物的暴食和其 他东西的贪欲一样。</td></tr><tr><td>The panic itself will not be as severe as Ruburt faces it and realizes the connection with a gulping of air.I know about the book on autohypnosis, and believe that this will be a big help to Ruburt along these lines, as it will enable him to bypass many of the ego's objections.This habit for various reasons then is deeply rooted, and seemed to be a harmless answer to a number of past and present needs and problems.</td><td>恐慌本身将不那么严重，只要鲁伯面对它，并明白这与大口吸气的关联。我知道 一本有关自动催眠的书，相信这对鲁伯在这些方面会有很大的帮助，因为这能让 他绕过很多来自自我的反对。那么，各种原因造成的这个习惯已经根深蒂固，似 乎也是一种对过去和现在的一些需求和问题的无害的解决办法。</td></tr><tr><td>It aggravates a certain amount of nervousness however and is not beneficial.In this also a definite but not bullying attitude is important.The panicky feeling is already lessening and Ruburts discipline is catching up with and conquering his emotional attitudes so that the problem will be worked out, that is he will stop smoking.</td><td>然而这在一定程度上加重了紧张的情绪，并且也没有好处。这其中，一种笃定但 不蛮强的态度是重要的。恐慌的感觉已经减轻，鲁伯的自律也正在赶上，并正在 克服他的情绪态度，所以问题将会得到解决，亦即，他会停止吸烟。</td></tr><tr><td>("Was Jane ever a smoker in a previous life?")</td><td>("珍在前世是个烟民吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>No.  It is his tendency to gobble here that is important.He has given up in this life gobbling food and drink.In past lives he was never temperate, neither in a physical sense, emotionally or intellectually.This was not in many ways bad.However when the intemperate personality does not discriminate then the basic characteristic can cause unpleasantness.He was always very generous for example and kind, even overly kind.On the other hand he ate and drank too much.He was just overeager as a rule.</td><td>不是，重要的是他在此狼吞虎咽的倾向。这一世他已经舍弃了暴饮暴食。在过去 的生命中，他向来是没有节制的，无论是在肉体感觉上、情感上或知性上。这在 许多方面都不是坏事。然而当无节制的人格不加分辨时，那么基本的特质就可能造成不愉快。比如他总是很慷慨，很善良，甚至太过善良。另一方面，他吃喝太 多。原则上他只是过度热切。</td></tr><tr><td>"His circumstances of birth made it difficult for him to overindulge in the rich things of life, although his present mother used rich foods as compensation for other things, and this example opened Ruburt's eyes and actually started him on the road to self-discipline.  "</td><td>他的出生环境让他很难过度耽溺于生活中丰盛事物，虽然他现在的母亲用丰盛的 食物作为其他方面的补偿，这个例子让鲁伯开了眼界，实际上也让他开始了自律 的道路。</td></tr><tr><td>I will go into this in a few moments, and suggest a brief break.</td><td>我一会儿再讲，建议稍作休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:32.Jane was fairly dissociated yet she was still aware of the subject matter above.She usually is, she said.Throughout this session she talked in a voice slightly stronger than normal, and paced at a slow even rate.Her eyes were dark, as usual.Resume at 9:36. )</td><td>(9:32 休息。珍相当的解离，但她还是知道前面的主题。她说，她通常是这样的。在这整节课，她说话的声音比平时稍微有力，踱步的速度也很平缓。她的眼睛漆黑如常。9:36 恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>This "gluttony," and you may put that in quotes, actually represented a terrific capacity for all kinds of consumption, and the consumption of knowledge was no exception.An impatience was also important, and the capacity also showed itself in an ability for psychic knowledge and a thirst in all matters pertaining to intellect, emotions and the physical.</td><td>这种"贪食"，你可以加引号，实际上代表了一种对各种摄入的惊人能力，对知识 的吸收也不例外。性急也是重要的，这种能力还表现在对灵性知识，以及对所有 与智力、情感和身体有关的事务的渴求。</td></tr><tr><td>"In the present personality we have abilities developed in past lives, and ability to paint for example that should be made more use of now.What you call Ruburt's sales ability is also a result of past experiences, and certain other latent abilities such as a facility with growing plants.He was at one time an excellent farmer. "</td><td>我们当前的人格拥有在过去生命中发展出来的一些能力，比如说绘画的能力，现 在应该多加利用。你所说的鲁伯的销售能力，也是过去的经验，以及某些其他的 潜在能力，比如说种植植物的才能。他曾经是位极到家的庄稼汉。</td></tr><tr><td>There has been here a willingness to experience, to experiment and to give as well as a ferocious capacity to take in.The trouble in the past has been a lack of discretion and self-discipline.He was always a pleasure-loving personality however and avoided anything unpleasant.His early circumstances in this life were chosen by him as a needed experience.In other lives he was able to exist without too much adversity and this time he chose troublesome and truly tragic circumstances as a needed challenge.</td><td>这里有一种去经历、实验和付出的意愿，也有一种强悍的接受能力。过去的麻烦 是欠缺谨慎和自律。不过他一直是个喜爱欢乐的人格，对任何不愉快的事情都避 而远之。他这一世的早年境况，是作为一种需要的经验而自己选择的。在其他 世，他能够在没有太多逆境的情况下生存，而这一世，他选择了麻烦的、真正悲 惨的境遇，作为需要的挑战。</td></tr><tr><td>His temper when aroused was very great however and he retaliated instantly.He had never known hatred however.This time he has had to deal with it in a most intimate manner.The old stormy temper is now seen in Ruburt's deep grudges.The personality of Ruburt's mother was not close to him in any other life.The circumstances of birth were chosen at the last minute on his part and was made for two reasons.</td><td>不过，他被激怒时的脾气非常大，他会立刻还击。然而他从不知道仇恨。这一 世，他已经不得不以一种最密切的方式来处理它。昔日的暴脾气，现在从鲁伯深 深的怨怼中可见一斑。鲁伯母亲的人格，在其他任何过去世中，都与他不亲近。出生的境况是他在最后一刻才选择的，是出于两个原因。</td></tr><tr><td>One, the personality of the mother offered needed experience for Ruburt; and two, the paganistic personality of the father was in some degree like his own past personalities though in a much more vague and watered-down way.A miscarriage later on the part of Ruburt's mother represented an entity who changed his mind so to speak.He was at one time a brother.Ruburts present shape is something he has been working for.He was often tall, hardy and stout.</td><td>第一，母亲的人格为鲁伯提供了所需要的经验；第二，父亲的异教徒人格在某种 程度上像他自己过去的人格，尽管是以一种更加模糊和淡化的方式。鲁伯母亲后来的一次流产，代表了一个存有改变了心意，可以这么说。他曾经是位兄弟。鲁 伯现在的外形是他一直在下功夫的结果。他过去往往是高大、坚韧又魁梧。</td></tr><tr><td>("Why did Jane have her miscarriage?")</td><td>("珍为什么会流产？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt's miscarriage was a result of something else entirely.This time you are both on your last reincarnation cycle on your plane, and as a rule no personality fragments are left behind.</td><td>鲁伯的流产完全是另外一个原因。这一次是你们在你们层面上的最后一个轮回转 世，原则上不会有人格片段被留在身后。</td></tr><tr><td>("What would happen if we did have a child?")</td><td>("如果我们真的有个孩子，会怎么样？")</td></tr><tr><td>This happens fairly often.It does not change the fact that it is the last reincarnation cycle for parents for example, although it may be lonely for the child in such an instance.I have not gone into these questions; however, to some degree in the subconscious mind you have what could be called a ghost image of your ancestors, and when your parents are in their last reincarnation cycle they leave your plane and it is more difficult for the ghost image to be imprinted.</td><td>这常常发生。比如说，这并不能改变这是父母最后一次轮回转世的事实，虽然在 这种情况下，孩子可能会觉得孤独。我还没有讨论到这些问题；不过，在某种程 度上，在你潜意识心智里，有一个可以被称作是祖先的鬼魂形象，当你们的双亲 是在他们最后的转世周期离开你们层面时，这个鬼魂形象就很难被铭记下来。</td></tr><tr><td>What you would call the wisdom of instinct is not then so sure.There have been however a few periods in mankind's history when this happened en masse.It just worked out that way that a large majority of personalities finished their cycles more or less at one time.</td><td>那么你们所谓本能的智慧，就不那么确定了。不过在人类历史上，有几个时期曾 大规模发生过这种事情。它是这样一个情况下的结果，就是绝大部分的人格都多 少是在同一时期完成了自己的转世周期。</td></tr><tr><td>("When was the last time this happened?")</td><td>("上一次发生这种情况是什么时候？")。</td></tr><tr><td>The Middle Ages represented such a break, and I also suggest a break.</td><td>中世纪代表了这样的一个断层，我也建议中断一下。</td></tr><tr><td>("In what century did this period begin?")</td><td>("这个时期是从哪个世纪开始的？")。</td></tr><tr><td>I will go into this more deeply after your break.</td><td>等你休息后，我会更深入谈这一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:02.During the above delivery Jane was in her usual state of dissociation.It was a very peaceful session.Resume at 10:07, Jane dictating.)</td><td>(10:02 休息。在上述传述过程中，珍处于她一贯的解离状态。这是非常平静的一节。10:07 恢复，珍传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>When the Middle Ages began a large number of personalities who had lived before and during the Roman period were ready to end their reincarnation cycles.There were the most efficient learners, the wisest and most able personalities, and they withdrew their subconscious knowledge and memories from your plane.</td><td>当中世纪开始的时候，一大批在罗马时代之前和期间生活过的人格，已经准备好 结束他们的轮回周期。最高效的学习者，最聪明和最有能力的人格，他们从你们 层面上撤回了他们潜意识的知识和记忆。</td></tr><tr><td>This was one of the reasons for the decay of knowledge and learning in the Middle Ages.There were personalities reincarnated during the Middle Ages who had lived during the Roman experience, however they were not leading personalities and they were not able to transmit knowledge or abilities from past lives, simply because they had not the inherent strength or capability needed.</td><td>这也是中世纪知识和学习衰败的原因之一。有一些在中世纪转世的人格，他们曾 在罗马经历中生活过，然而他们并不是主导人格，他们无法传授前世的知识和能 力，只因为他们不具备所需要的内在力量和能力。</td></tr><tr><td>There were other personalities of course who were fairly developed but these were resting.The world so to speak got back on its feet when these personalities reappeared centuries later; and by this time new personalities who had taken the place of those whose cycles were completed also began to use and show their abilities.</td><td>当然，也有其他发展得相当好的人格，但他们都在休息。当这些人格在几世纪后 再次出现时，世界可以说是重新站了起来；而这时，取代了那些轮回周期已完成 的人格的新人格，也开始使用并展现他们的能力。</td></tr><tr><td>("In what century did the withdrawal take place?")</td><td>("撤出发生在哪个世纪？")。</td></tr><tr><td>"By the end of the 10th century the first group of personalities completed their cycle.It took the period of time from then until the late 1600's for any valid readjustment to take place, and by the middle 17th century you began to get bursts of beneficial activities and new thrusts of knowledge. "</td><td>到 10 世纪末，第一组人格完成了他们的轮回周期。从那时起一直到 16 世纪末，才有了一些有效的重新调整，到了 17 世纪中叶，你们开始有了爆发性的有益活动和知识的新推力。</td></tr><tr><td>The monks who copied old manuscripts and preserved some remnants of knowledge did so because of their own past personal connection and experience with the knowledge itself.</td><td>僧侣们抄写旧手稿，保存一些知识的残余，他们这么做是因为他们在过去与这些 知识本身的个人联结和经历。</td></tr><tr><td>("Were the French and American revolutions related to such a burst?")</td><td>("法国革命和美国革命是否与这样的爆发有关？")。</td></tr><tr><td>The revolutions, both of them, were so connected, representing an offshoot from the freedoms initiated in Athens and greatly expanded.Great Britain was in many respects a special place in that many of those personalities who had been resting were born there at fairly regular intervals, and you had a more consistent belief in liberty that did not necessitate such bloody and unfortunate revolutions as those that occurred elsewhere.</td><td>这两场革命都与之相关，代表着从雅典发起的自由运动的一个分支，并得到了极 大的扩展。大不列颠在许多方面是一个特殊的地方，那些一直在休息的人格，相 当定期地在那里出生， 你们对自由持有更一致的信念，没有必要像其他地方发生的那样，发生血腥和不幸的革命。</td></tr><tr><td>("What's the case in Russia today?")</td><td>("今天俄罗斯的情况如何？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Today?</td><td>今天？</td></tr><tr><td>("Well, in this century then.")</td><td>("那就说本世纪吧。")。</td></tr><tr><td>It is in many ways the fault of personalities themselves as to which lands are developed or underdeveloped in various ways.Many personalities prefer rebirth in pleasant temperate or warm climates.Often they congregate for such selfish reasons in pleasant climates and in countries where political situations are not dangerous.</td><td>土地以各种方式被开发或未被开发，在很多方面是出于人格本身的毛病。许多人 格喜欢选在气候宜人或温带的地方重新出生。他们往往出于这种自私的原因，聚 集在气候宜人、政治局势不危险的国家。</td></tr><tr><td>This has been the case with the country of Russia in the past but it may not be the case in the future; as activity grows there intellectual and psychic attractions will draw stronger and wiser personalities.The same in a somewhat different manner will apply to countries in Africa.</td><td>俄罗斯这个国家过去是这样，但未来可能不会如此了；随着活动的增加，那里智 性和灵性的吸引力将吸引更强大、更聪明的人格。同样的情况也将以某种不同的 方式适用于非洲国家。</td></tr><tr><td>There are whole areas of material here that we have not discussed so that this is spotty, but we will go into it more deeply.There are no laws to force personalities to use all their abilities.A personality will not choose unfavorable circumstances of rebirth until he himself sees that necessary discipline can be achieved in no other manner.Therefore extremely hot and extremely cold countries go largely undeveloped.But once development begins to occur it is swift.</td><td>有个完整范畴的资料，我们尚未讨论过，所以这只是零星的，但我们会更深入地 谈论。并没有什么规律能迫使人格使用他们所有的能力。人格不会选择不利的重生环境，除非他自己看到，除此之外，没有其他方式能达成必要的学习锻炼。因 此极热和极寒的国家基本上没有开发。但一旦开始发展，就会很迅速。</td></tr><tr><td>The problems that a country must work out merely represent the problems set by the personality inhabitants for themselves, and the country is merely the framework of such activities.There is a close bond between incarnational cycles and earthly historical periods that we will discuss later.Sometimes though not always personalities who need a certain experience will be born into a particular country or race.I have been somewhat avoiding this whole issue since delicate balances are interconnected, and the question of the Jews is one that must bother all men.</td><td>一个国家必须解决的问题，只是代表在那居住的人格为自己设定的问题，国家只 是这类行为的架构。转世周期和尘世的历史时期之间有着密切的联系，我们将在 后面讨论。有时候，需要某种经验的人格，未必会出生在某个特定的国家或种 族。我一直有些回避这整个议题，因为微妙的平衡是相互牵联的，而犹太人的问 题，就必然困扰到所有的人。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break.</td><td>我建议稍作休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Once again, as the question of the Jews came to my mind, Jane began to immediately discuss it as she had seemed to somehow pick up my unspoken questions quite often recently.</td><td>(又一次，当犹太人的问题浮现在我脑海时，珍马上开始谈起这个问题，她最近似 乎经常接受到我没有说出口的问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:32.Jane was somewhat dissociated as usual.Resume at 10:35. )</td><td>(10:32 休息。珍解离如常。10:35 继续)。</td></tr><tr><td>The same personalities are not always reborn for example in the same race.It is true that your history shows a continuity of Jewish persecutions, that is persecutions of Jews.The fact is that many personalities who have been famous in many eras have also been proud, brilliant and cruel, and have belittled and persecuted those they considered beneath them.</td><td>同样的人格并不总是再转世到，例如同一个种族中。你们的历史确实显示了犹太 人受迫害的连续性，也就是对犹太人的迫害。事实上，许多时代有名的人物，也 曾骄傲、辉煌、残酷过，并且曾轻视、迫害他们认为低于他们的人。</td></tr><tr><td>These personalities, often talented in many directions and often with past experiences of wealth and power, choose to be born as Jews of their own volition, and this is a karmic compensation, not in any sense punishment but a needed adjustment on the part of the personalities involved.</td><td>这些人格，往往具有多方面的才华，并且在过去有着财富和权力的经历，他们自 愿选择生为犹太人，这是一种业的补偿(karmic compensation)，并非任何意义上的惩罚，而是对所涉及人格的一种必要的调整。</td></tr><tr><td>The horrible misdeeds committed upon the Jews by the Germans were certainly not asked for specifically.However large numbers of those Jews were Huns of a very cruel variety in a past existence.</td><td>德国人对犹太人犯下的可怕恶行，当然不是特意要求的。然而，这些犹太人中， 有很多在过去世中，曾是非常残酷的匈奴人。</td></tr><tr><td>The Germans of that particular generation were not revenging past misdeeds.Revenge has no place in this discussion.In one sense there is no excuse for what occurred.The Jewish people have always displayed great financial abilities, these being natural remnants of knowledge of wealth, as in previous lives many of them had positions of power which they misused.</td><td>那特定一代的德国人，并不是在报复那过去的恶行。这个讨论不存在报复的议 题。从某种意义上说，对所发生的事是没有任何借口的。犹太人一向展现出很强 的财经能力，这些都是对财富知识的自然遗留物，在他们的前世，许多人都拥有 滥用了的权势地位。</td></tr><tr><td>Your generation as a whole had to learn the importance of thought and responsibility.You had to learn that basically to hate is to kill.The lesson was a practical one.The Germans and the Jews made it plain.Had the hatred not existed in the Germans, it could not have been channeled as it was against the Jews.Free will operated here as always.</td><td>你们这一代作为一个整体，必须学会思想和责任的重要性。你们必须学会，基本 上，仇恨就是杀戮。这是个实际的教训。德国人和犹太人清楚地表明了这一点。如果仇恨未存在于德国人心中，它就不会那样地被导向对付犹太人。自由意志在 这里一如既往地运作着。</td></tr><tr><td>("Have we learned our lesson?")</td><td>("我们吸取教训了吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>"You are beginning to learn the lesson.Ruburt's vehement anger over something that seems perhaps much more trivial, the death by shooting of the starlings, is a case in point.

"</td><td>恐惧是源于母亲对父亲嘲讽的结果，这个解释，相信即使在意识上，鲁伯也会觉 得有道理。你们两人完全有能力可以互相帮助，这应该会让事情变得容易些。而 约瑟，我们很快就会进入内在感官。我已经给了你们一些其他的一般资料，有点 像大纲的形式，为进一步的课程做准备。</td></tr><tr><td>And you have done well this week, working out some challenges concerning your paintings.Our sessions will of course vary in many respects and this is to be expected.I did incidentally watch Ruburt write one of his poems about the starlings, and though poetry was never one of my lines I have to admit that I was quite impressed.</td><td>这一周你做得很好，解决了一些关于你的绘画的挑战。我们的课程当然在各方面 都将是多样性的，这是可以预期的。我偶然看到鲁伯写了一首关于椋鸟的诗，虽 然对诗歌我从来就不内行，但我不得不承认，我印象深刻。</td></tr><tr><td>("Which poem was it?")</td><td>("是哪首诗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>It was the poem that Ruburt sent to the paper.</td><td>就是鲁伯寄给报社的那首。</td></tr><tr><td>Incidentally Ruburt always felt a strong bond with every living thing, and even as a man was not cruel.He was only a Christian once, the last time, and otherwise was paganism but always in ways that enabled him to feel close to the earth.This is of course one of the main reasons for his particular reaction with the starling incident, and this quality has been a saving one in the past.</td><td>顺便说一下，鲁伯总是觉得自己与每一个生物都有很强的联系，即使身为男人时 也不残酷。他只当过一次基督徒，就是在上一世，除此之外，他是异教徒，但总 是以能让他感到亲近大地的方式。当然，这也是他对椋鸟事件做出特殊反应的主 要原因之一，这个特质是从过去保留下来的。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest another short break, and I will resume for only a few moments after.Yes, I do know it is raining and that your spring is on its way.</td><td>我建议再休息一会儿，只休息一会儿就继续。是的，我知道下雨了，你们的春天 就要来了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:29.Jane had some dissociation.Resume at 11:33. )</td><td>(11:29 休息。珍有一些解离。11:33 恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>A reverence for life is a saving characteristic of any personality who has it.It adds of itself important elements of understanding and growth in a direct manner.Reverence for life will also enable you to understand and deal with other human beings in a more kindly and beneficial manner.</td><td>对生命的敬畏是任何拥有这种敬畏的人格所保存下来的特性。它本身就直接增加 了理解和成长的重要因素。敬畏生命也能让你以更善意、更有益的方式去理解和 对待其他人类。</td></tr><tr><td>It will enable you to act and to help without blaming them for shortcomings, since these shortcomings may actually have been chosen by them for reasons of compensation.I do not want this session to run too long, however the reverence for life is so important that I wanted to underline it, and also to emphasize that it includes all life and man himself.</td><td>它能让你在行动和帮助时，不至于责怪他人的缺点，因为这些缺点其实可能是他 们出于补偿的原因而做的选择。我不希望这节课过长，然而对生命的敬畏是如此 的重要，所以我要强调它们，同时也要强调，它包括所有生命和人类自己。</td></tr><tr><td>Later I will go into the creation of other planes, and remember also that as man creates his own camouflage pattern he also works out his problems on the stage of history, which is also his creation.This is a point worth remembering.</td><td>后面我会讲到其他层面的创造，还要记住，当人类创造自己的伪装模式时，他也 在历史舞台上解决自己的问题，这也是他的创造。这是值得记住的一点。</td></tr><tr><td>This session has been very peaceful and pleasant, and I repeat: Some night we will have our party.Now that you have a recorder you can use it when we have our happy session and it will free you from taking notes.</td><td>这节课非常平静和愉快，我重复一遍：某个晚上我们将开个派对。现在你有了录 音机，当我们开心上课时，你可以用它，让手自由，不用再记笔记了。</td></tr><tr><td>"I haven't had the opportunity to use my sense of humor lately but it is still here as you will discover.This is one of those nights when I dislike saying goodbye for now, but I will.And Ruburt please heed my advice, all of it. "</td><td>我最近没机会发挥我的幽默感，但你会发现，它还在这里。这是一个我不想说再 见的那种夜晚，但我还是要说。而鲁伯请听从我的忠告，所有的忠告。</td></tr><tr><td>Good night, my chicks.</td><td>晚安，我的小鸡们。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good night, Seth."</td><td>("晚安，赛斯。"</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 11:41.  )</td><td>(11:41 结束)。</td></tr><tr><td>March 2, 1964, Monday</td><td>1964 年 3 月 2 日，星期一鸟之雕像</td></tr><tr><td>Bird Sculpts</td><td>两只椋鸟飞来飞去在地窖画廊的窗户</td></tr><tr><td>Two starlings fluttered</td><td>那铁护栏的水槽后。</td></tr><tr><td>Behind the iron bar gutter</td><td>我经过，</td></tr><tr><td>That protects the cellar</td><td>一只轧叫着我停住。</td></tr><tr><td>Windows of the art gallery.</td><td>我低头一看看到两团黑色的毛茸毛茸的鸟仰头盯着我</td></tr><tr><td>I passed, and one squawked</td><td>惊恐地看着我逼近的身影。</td></tr><tr><td>Me to a stop.

It is a warm and very windy day here in Elmira, much windier than usual.The streets have been littered with debris from trees, and driving home this noon after taking Jane to work I felt several small limbs strike the roof of the car.</td><td>(那是 1964 年 3 月 6 日，艾尔迈拉的天气很暖和，风很大，比平时大得多。街上到处都是吹落下来的残枝碎叶，中午送珍上班后开车回家，我感觉到有几根小树 枝打到车顶上。</td></tr><tr><td>(Back home and ready to being typing, I found it so windy and noisy I thought it best to close the windows.The tree that lost the branch stands perhaps thirty feet away on my right; actually it sits on a neighbor's property.It is an elm that died a few years ago, and possessed a very beautiful and symmetrical shape.I have drawn it several times, the most elaborate drawing being one I intended to incorporate in a tempera painting last winter.I did not get the work done. "</td><td>(回到家准备打字时，发现风很大，而且很吵，我想最好关上窗户。断掉树枝的那 棵树就在我右手边大概 30 英呎远的地方，其实它长在邻居的地产上。是一棵榆树，几年前就死了，有个非常美丽和对称的树形。我曾多次画过它，最精心的那一幅，去年冬天我本打算把它纳入一幅蛋彩画中。我没完成这项工作。</td></tr><tr><td>(Before starting work this afternoon I studied my favorite tree for a while, noticing that the force of the wind had begun to peel back large sections of bark from some of the middle limbs.One of these limbs arched up over our lawn toward our living room on the second floor, and the jutting-out bay windows of the apartment beneath us on the ground floor.I remember thinking that if this limb should fall, it would be long enough to strike the house.</td><td>(下午开始工作前，我端详了一会儿我最喜欢的那棵树，发现风的力量已经开始从 一些中间的树干上剥下大片树皮。其中有一根拱型的树干，越过我们的草坪，伸向我们二楼的客厅，以及我们楼下公寓的凸出窗台。我记得我当时在想，如果这枝树干倒下，它的长度足以击中房子。</td></tr><tr><td>(I began work, sitting with my back to the tree so that I did not see the actual fall.I heard and felt a great roar.The whole house shook with a thump.I heard wires flap loose.Turning, I saw that this particular limb had indeed fallen.Fortunately, it had broken off halfway up, and its tip barely missed our house.Now the yard is littered with sections of limb several inches in diameter and perhaps twenty-five feet long.Our television cable has also been ripped loose.</td><td>(我开始工作，背对着树坐着，所以我没有看到实际的坠落。我听到也感觉到轰然 巨响。砰的一声，整栋房子都在摇晃。我听到了电线松动发出火花的声音。一转身，我就看到这枝树干真的折断了。幸运的是，它已在中间断裂开，树梢几乎打到我们的房子。现在，院子里到处都是直径几英寸、长约二十五英呎的断树枝。我们的电视电缆线也被扯松了。</td></tr><tr><td>(I wonder: Watching the tree, did my inner senses tell me the limb would fallâinformation that I casually disregarded?Or is it just coincidence?</td><td>(我在想：当我看着树时，我的内在感官是否在告诉我树枝会掉下来—是我不经意 忽略的信息？还是只是巧合？</td></tr><tr><td>(At 8:30 this evening Jane had "not even a glimmer" of what Seth would discuss for the session. She did not say so, but by watching her I saw that she was becoming nervous, as she has quite often.She said that sometimes for a period of perhaps two weeks, she will have an idea of what Seth will talk about; then will begin a longer period during which she has no advance ideas.At 8:55 this evening she still had no idea of what she would be talking about.At 8:59 she had "just a tiny glimmer. "</td><td>(晚上 8:30，珍对赛斯要讨论的内容"丝毫不知"，她没说，但看着她，我看见她变得紧张起来，她经常这样。她说，有时在大概两个星期的时间里，她对赛斯要谈什么会有个概念；然后会开始一段较长的时间，在这段时间里，她没有事先的想 法。今晚 8:55，她仍然不知道自己会讲什么。8:59，她有"一丝概念"了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane began this session, without the board as usual, in a fairly strong voice.She immediately began to pace back and forth.Her eyes darkened.)</td><td>(如往常一样，珍在没有显灵板的情况下，以相当有力的声音开始了这一节。她立 即开始来回踱步。她的眼睛变黑了。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening, my scalawags.</td><td>晚安，我的小淘气们。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.  ")</td><td>("晚安，赛斯")。</td></tr><tr><td>The wind knows the tree.The tree feels the wind.It knows it is not the wind, but only feels the wind.Likewise Ruburt feels me but is not me.I may be a big wind, but I am not her big wind.</td><td>风知道树。树感觉到风。树知道自己不是风，只是感觉到风。同样，鲁伯感觉到 我，却不是我。我也许是一阵大风，但我不是她的大风。</td></tr><tr><td>This naturally is an answer again to Ruburt's constant questioning.Sometimes, without your confidence, Joseph, I would certainly have a difficult time trying to get through to Ruburt.He is however under a considerable strain, as undoubtedly he has told you.The ego rears its head, in this case a rather attractive head, and the ego makes its protests.</td><td>这自然又是对鲁伯不断质问的回答。有时候，如果没有你的信任，约瑟，我想透 过鲁伯来沟通肯定会很困难。然而，毫无疑问，他已经告诉你了，他承受着相当 大的压力。自我昂起它的头，在这个例子里，是一个相当有吸引力的头，自我提 出了它的抗议。</td></tr><tr><td>There is on Ruburt's part a fear of becoming overly involved, and there is no basis here for any such danger.The wind is the wind irregardless of the branches through which it blows, and I am, irregardless of the subconscious mind in which or through which I appear.This should not need repeating.Obviously however I must repeat it constantly.</td><td>鲁伯这方面害怕过度投入，其实没有任何这类危险的根据存在。风就是风，不管 它吹过什么树枝，而我就是我，不管我是呈现在潜意识或透过潜意识显现。这应 该不需要再重复了。但显然，我必须不断重复这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>"The American Society for Psychic Research will give you greater benefits I believe than the people at Duke, in this particular instance.I was not aware through Ruburt's subconscious mind of the Society when Duke was mentioned earlier in these sessions.In the long run you are both better off that Ruburt's publishing house did not take her book at this time.Incidentally, Ruburt is learning some inner confidence as far as depending upon his inner resources in the handling of problems in ordinary and professional life. "</td><td>在这种特殊的情况下，美国灵异研究学会能给你们的助益，我相信会比杜克大学 的人还大。之前在这些课程中提到杜克的时候，我并没有通过鲁伯的潜意识意识 到这个学会。从长远来看，鲁伯的出版社没有在这个时候接受她的书，对你们两 反而比较好。顺便说一句，鲁伯在平时和职业生活中处理问题时，就依靠自己的 内在资源，学会了一些内在的自信。</td></tr><tr><td>I have mentioned before that there is no invasion of any kind in these sessions.Ruburt merely allowed himself to recognize my existence.Obviously, I exist whether he recognizes me or not.Nor, and this is strictly for the record, since I know that you both understand this, nor am I any so-called spirit.</td><td>我曾说过，在这些课程中，没有任何形式的入侵。鲁伯只是容许自己承认我的存 在。显然，无论他是否承认我，我都存在。我也不是，这一点要严格备案，因为 我知道你们都明白这一点，我也不是什么所谓的幽灵。</td></tr><tr><td>The term in itself is not only archaic and superstitious but absolutely detrimental to furthering knowledge of psychic phenomena, as it is called, usually.</td><td>这个词本身不仅是过时和迷信，而且绝对不利于进一步了解灵性现象，如它经常 被称呼的那样。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was still talking in a voice stronger than usual, though not one any deeper beyond a slight degree. Her pacing was rather slow.Also, her delivery was quite slow and deliberate.)</td><td>(珍说话的声音还是比平时有力，也还是有一点低沉，但她的踱步也相当慢。而 且，她的传述方式也相当缓慢和慎重。)</td></tr><tr><td>To say I am energy is no lie.It is actually truer than many designations that would sound more authentic and complicated.I am a personality in essence-energy form.This in no way implies that I am a spirit, nor does it imply that I am some weird sort of granddaddy longlegs of science fiction.What I am is difficult to explain because of the limits set not only by your own knowledge but by the present method of our communications.</td><td>说我是能量，这并非谎言。它其实比很多听起来更真实、更复杂的名称还要真 实。我是一个以能量本质为形式的人格。这绝不意味着我是一个幽灵，也不意味 着我是科幻小说中某种怪异的长腿老爹。我是什么，是很难解释的，因为不仅受 限于你们自己的知识，也受限于我们目前的沟通方式。</td></tr><tr><td>("I was thinking that perhaps you were like an emotional state.")</td><td>("我在想，也许你就像一种情绪状态。")。</td></tr><tr><td>It is even difficult for me to answer that, since you are partly on the track and partly way off.The emotional aspect of course would be the personality- essence.However it also has a structure that is very simple, but to you would appear complicated to the extreme.This is because of your present habit of thinking in word patterns rather than energy transferral complexes.</td><td>我甚至难以回答这个问题，因为你一部分说在题上，一部分跑在题外。情感的面 向当然是人格的精髓。然而它也有一个非常简单的结构，但对你来说会显得复杂 到极点。这是因为你现在的思维习惯是用文字模式而不是能量转移复合体。</td></tr><tr><td>I do have a structure nevertheless, and I can change or interchange the components of that structure so as to appear or operate under vastly different conditions.During these sessions I use my basic energy components in a different manner than I would under other circumstances.In other words, I change the alignment of my components, focusing my powers into one particular direction.</td><td>不过，我确实有一个结构，我可以改变或互换这个结构的组成部分，以便在截然 不同的条件下出现或运作。在这些课程中，我以不同于其他情况下的方式使用我 的基本能量成分。换句话说，我改变了我的组件的排列，把我的力量集中到一个 特定的方向。</td></tr><tr><td>If you wanted to enter a very small space you would, I presume, get down on all fours, hunch your shoulders and crawl in this imaginary hole headfirst.</td><td>如果你想进入一个很小的空间，我想，你会四肢着地，拱起肩膀，头部率先爬进 这个想像的洞里。</td></tr><tr><td>This would involve manipulations of muscles that would result in a temporary change of shape, a somewhat superficial but real adjustment of the physical body in its relation to space, and a consequent change of focus or direction in so far as the forward low thrust of the body into the hole.On a much different level this is what is involved as far as I am concerned in my attempts to enter your small entryway.On my part however the necessary manipulations amount to a transformation, and I have much greater freedom here.It is as if you could actually make your body smaller than the hole you wished to enter, in a much more appreciable fashion.</td><td>这将涉及到对肌肉的操纵，会导致身形的暂时改变，身体因应空间而做的一点表 面上但真实的调整，以及随之而来的焦点或方向的改变，再到身体向前压低挤入 洞中。在一个相当不同的层面上，就我而言，这就是我在试图进入你们小小入口 时所涉及到的。不过对我来说，这些必要的操作相当于一种转变，在这方面我有 极大的自由。就好像你实际上可以把你的身体变得比你想进入的洞口更小，以一 种更值得赞赏的方式。</td></tr><tr><td>I have at my command so to speak boundless energy to draw upon, but then so have you.The main difference is that I am more equipped to draw upon this energy, and I am better equipped because I have additional knowledge which I have put to use.</td><td>可以说，我有无穷无尽的能量可供汲取，而你们也是。主要的差别是，我更有能 力汲取这些能量，我之所以更有能力，是因为我已经用上了我更多的知识。</td></tr><tr><td>Your scientists know that all matter is composed of the same elements.They do not know consciously how to change a river into a forest.This manipulation, as I have explained, is undertaken unknown to the recognized conscious ego.</td><td>你们的科学家知道，所有的物质都由相同的元素组成。他们不知道如何有意识地 把一条河流变成森林。如我所解释过的，这种操纵，是在被认可的有意识自我不 知道的情况下进行的。</td></tr><tr><td>Through methods that I have described, I can change my form.You have seen water turn to steam.This is a very simple analogy.I exist as energy, I exist electronically and sometimes chemically.I have said that I can change the alignment of my components.If I can be considered a spirit then all energy must be a spirit.</td><td>通过我所描述的方法，我可以改变我的形态。你见过水变成蒸汽的样子。这是个 很简单的比喻。我以能量的形式存在，我以电性方式存在，有时也以化学方式存 在。我已经说过，我可以改变我的组成部分的排列。如果我可以被认为是一种幽 灵，那么所有的能量也ㄧ定都是幽灵。</td></tr><tr><td>Your idea of a spirit, I believe, is something without form, and I can have form.I certainly have structure.It is true at this point, under ordinary circumstancesâthat is ordinary for youâyou cannot "see"âin quotesâmy structure.This does not mean that I have none.</td><td>你们对灵的概念，我相信，是某种无形的东西，而我可以是有形的。我当然有结构。在这一点上是真的，在一般的情况下——对你们来说是ㄧ般的——你不能"看 到"我的结构。这并不意味着我没有结构。</td></tr><tr><td>At some time you may be able to experience my structure.You see, the inner senses provide direct experience.The outer senses provide camouflaged distortions of translated second handed experience.</td><td>在某些时候，你也许能体验到我的结构。你知道，内在感官提供直接的经验。外 在感官则提供转译过的二手经验的伪装扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break, my dear pudding heads.I will stir you all up.</td><td>我建议大家休息一下，亲爱的布丁脑袋瓜。我会把你们全搅和起来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:41.This portion of the session ran longer than usual, and Jane said Seth didn't want to stop.Jane was mildly dissociated.She said that she has been stewing about the problem of involvement since receiving the letter from the psychiatrist, but that the above material made her feel better.</td><td>(9:41 休息。这部分课程比平时长，珍说赛斯不想停下来。珍轻度解离。她说，自从收到那位精神科医生的信后，她一直纠结在所涉入的问题，但上述资料让她感觉好一点。</td></tr><tr><td>(During this delivery her voice retained its strong, slow and deliberate character.When she began dictating again her pacing picked up somewhat, and her voice remained the same.Resume at 9:48. )</td><td>(在这传述过程中，她的声音仍然维持著有力、缓慢和慎重的特征。当她再次开始 传述时，她的踱步有些加快，声音则保持不变。9:48 恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>You or your scientists are simply not yet aware of many basic laws that govern such things as my structure, though already some of these are glimpsed by the more original thinkers.</td><td>你或你们的科学家们，根本还不知道有许多基本的规律在管辖像我这种结构之类 的事情，虽然已经有一些规律被更有独创性的思想家瞥见了。</td></tr><tr><td>("In this country?")</td><td>("在这个国家吗？")</td></tr><tr><td>Abroad.A few in your country are becoming aware on a very faint theoretical basis, when they consider the possibilities involved in the breaking down of physical components into basic energy forms, such theories being considered I believe along with a future space program.This idea will help you understand what I mean when I say that I have structure but can change it.</td><td>在国外。你们国家有少数人，在非常薄弱的理论基础上，开始意识到，当他们在 思考将物质成分分解为基本的能量形式所涉及到的可能性时，这种理论正在被考 量，我相信是与未来的太空计划一并考虑的。这个概念可以帮助你理解，我说我 有结构，但可以改变结构是什么意思。</td></tr><tr><td>I bring about such realignment of molecular patterns through direct manipulation.This will not be possible at your level.Even in the distant future such realignments will involve costly, complicated and almost impossible achievements because you will be trying to approach the problem working from the outside inward.The solution lies in manipulations made upon structures from the inside, or a very direct manipulation of the whole self.</td><td>我透过直接操纵让这种分子模式重新排列。这在你们层面是不可能的。即使在遥 远的未来，这样的重新组合也会涉及到昂贵的、复杂的、几乎不可能的成就，因 为你们将试图由外而内地解决问题。解决之道在于从内部对结构进行操纵，或者 由整体自己进行非常直接的操纵。</td></tr><tr><td>("Do you know who is working on these problems now?")</td><td>("你知道现在谁在研究这些问题吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not know specific people, but I will improve upon these matters as our grand duchess lowers her guard.I am quite dependent upon your Ruburt- Jane, not in my own perceptions but in my ability to communicate them to you.The whole problem lies here, but we are making strides, and we are making them despite some personal temporary setbacks, when Ruburt reads a book that makes him worry about these sessions.Then all three of us work twice as hard for the same results.</td><td>我不知道特定的人员，但当我们的大公夫人降低戒备时，我会在这些事情上有所改进。我很依赖你的鲁伯-珍，这不在于我自己的看法，而是我向你传达这些讯息 的能力。整个问题就出在这里，但我们正在取得进展，纵使当鲁伯读了一本书而让他担心这些课程，让个人暂时受到了一些挫折，我们也仍在进步中。那么我们三个人，都会为了相同的成果，付出加倍的努力。</td></tr><tr><td>("At least were getting the results.")</td><td>("至少是得到了结果。")。</td></tr><tr><td>We have come along far enough so that we are beyond the danger of failure, I believe.Confidence must be built up slowly.That is why I have managed things in the way that I have.Confidence is extremely important and your confidence, Joseph, is an important, I might say indispensable, plus in our whole relationship.</td><td>我们已经走到了今天，我相信我们已经摆脱了失败的危险。信心必须慢慢建立起 来。这就是为什么我以我的方式处理事情。信心极其重要，而你的信心，约瑟， 是我们整个关系中一个重要的，我可以说是不可或缺的加分。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not believe though I am not certain that Ruburt would go along, certainly not in such a positive manner, if it were not for your

It is known however that a feeling of affirmation and confidence is indispensable in any such circumstances.The tricky thing here is that a plus expectancy and inner confidence always brings the best results with the least effort.Ruburt is attracted by and yet doubtful of his own abilities.This is based upon the personal feelings of Ruburt, who is a woman now and does not wish to appear flighty or hysteric.</td><td>我不认为你在逼他，我也不认为我在逼他，然而众所周知，在任何这样的情况 下，一种肯定和信心的感觉是不可或缺的。这里不好掌握的是，加强的期待和内 在的信心总是能以最少的努力带来最佳的结果。鲁伯被自己的能力所吸引，却又 对自己的能力产生怀疑。这是基于鲁伯的个人感觉，他现在身为女人，不希望显 得飘忽不定或歇斯底里。</td></tr><tr><td>He knows that his particular abilities are very well developed on a subconscious level, and actually fears that they might carry him away.Yet the intuitive qualities have made him a poet, and have always represented a strong and not weak part of his personality.They are actually well balanced in that they are not likely to sweep him off in any one direction willy-nilly, but could allow him a steady progression into various levels of direct experience.</td><td>他知道自己在潜意识层面上发展得非常好，其实也担心这些能力会让他沉迷其 中。然而直觉的品质已经使他成为诗人，并且一直代表着他人格中强大而非软弱 的部分。它们其实是很平衡的，因为它们不可能胡乱地把他扫向任何一个方向， 而是可以让他稳步地进入各种层次的直接经验。</td></tr><tr><td>("Is that why you said it's a good idea for Jane to wait on her book yet?")</td><td>("所以你才会说，珍再等一等才出书是个好主意吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>No.</td><td>不是。</td></tr><tr><td>You however are not so afraid of your own abilities.I am speaking now of psychic abilities and the reason is again personal, since you have been aware of them in a somewhat different manner.You appear to others as dependable, responsible and disciplined.Ruburt, with a different appearance and with different personal background, particularly involving his mother, has been fearful of displaying characteristics that he would consider emotional because the emotional is such a part of his personality, and there has been a distrust here of the strong parts of his personality.</td><td>然而，你对自己的能力并不那么害怕。我现在说的是心灵能力，原因又是个人性 的，因为你已经以某种不同的方式，意识到它们的存在。在别人眼中，你是可 靠、负责任、有纪律的。鲁伯，则有不同的显现，和不同的个人背景，尤其是涉 及到他母亲的部分，他一直害怕表现出他认为是情绪化的特征，因为情绪是如此 地占据他人格的一部分，这里一直存在着对他人格中强势部分的不信任。</td></tr><tr><td>This was the result in the past of the adolescent's rather natural lack of discipline.You learned discipline at an early age, and therefore did not have to fear the abilities that you disciplined rather easily, and for reasons that I have explained to you earlier.This gives you greater inner confidence, and the confidence itself is a very important element in these sessions.</td><td>这是过去青春期很自然地缺乏纪律的结果。你很小就学到纪律，因此不必害怕你 相当容易自律的能力，原因我在前面已经给你解释过了。这给了你更多内在的信 心，而信心本身在这些课中是非常重要的元素。</td></tr><tr><td>("Jane appears confident enough once she starts a session.")</td><td>("一旦课开始，珍就显得有足够信心了。")。</td></tr><tr><td>Once the session has begun he is confident.For this small favor I thank him.I do however understand the problem.You may ask me what you wish.</td><td>课一开始，他就有了信心。对于这个小忙，我感谢他。不过我的确明白问题所 在。你可以问我你想问的。</td></tr><tr><td>("Well, I was just wondering if Jane's confidence will increase when others begin to read this material.")</td><td>("🗎，我只是想知道，当其他人开始阅读这些资料时，珍的信心是否会增 加。")</td></tr><tr><td>I believe that it will.Confidence should increase with each session.I have no control over exterior circumstances that affect you, however.Ruburt naturally can learn and is learning to control his responses to such conditions, and incidentally this week he has made a few strides as far as the quiet times he has spent in using psychological time.</td><td>我相信会的。信心应该会随着每次的课程而增加。不过，我无法控制影响你们的 外部环境。鲁伯自然可以学习，也正在学习控制自己对这类情况的反应，正好他 在在本周用了一些安静的时段在心理时间上，也有了相当的进步。</td></tr><tr><td>I mentioned in an earlier session that Ruburt helps in reassembling me, and here your affirmation, Joseph, is a great aid.</td><td>我在之前的一次课中提过，鲁伯有助于我的重新组合，而这里，你的肯定，约 瑟，是极大的援助。</td></tr><tr><td>("In the actual reassembly?")</td><td>("在实际的重新组合上吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>"Yes.

he was unavailable after all.But Jane felt immediately relieved just because she had followed her impulse.</td><td>(事情的发展是，之前说晚上会在家的李奥纳德，刚听到朋友说，要出去喝啤酒， 他终究是没空来了。珍马上觉得松了一口气，因为她随顺了自己的冲动。</td></tr><tr><td>(By 8:50 she was again nervous.She was also tired, as I was.When she said that the thought of talking and pacing for 2'h or 3 hours was somewhat appalling, I had to admit that I felt the same way about the physical labor of writing for that period of time.</td><td>(到了 8:50，她又紧张起来。她和我都累了。当她说，想到要讲两三个小时，还要踱步，真有点吓人，我也要承认，我对那段时间写作的体力劳动，也觉得有点可怕。</td></tr><tr><td>(But Jane began talking just the same at a few moments after 9 PM, in a voice a bit stronger and deeper than normal.)</td><td>(但晚上 9 点多的时候，珍还是一样开始说话，声音比平时更有力、更低沉。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good afternoonâ</td><td>下午好</td></tr><tr><td>("Huh?"</td><td>("啊？"</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth's greeting surprised us both;

I can exist electronically or I can exist chemically, and there is no contradiction or distortion in this statement.  Many such apparent effects on your plane are also but manifestations.</td><td>当我用电子和化学这两个字眼时，我是为了简化，因为电子和化学是一体的两 面，仅仅是其他东西的表现形式，就像热与冷或火与冰，都是其他东西的表现一</td></tr><tr><td>("Can you give us an instance of your chemical state?")</td><td>样。我能够以电子的形式存在，也能够以化学的形式存在，这句话没有矛盾和扭 曲。在你们的层面上，许多这种显现的效果，也都只是体现方式而已。</td></tr><tr><td>An instance?</td><td>("你能给我们一个你在化学状态的例子吗？")。一个例子？</td></tr><tr><td>("When you' re in an actual chemical state.  ")</td><td>("当你处于实际的化学状态时")。</td></tr><tr><td>When I prefer to be, when it is necessary.There is too much involved in this for me to explain much of it to you at this time.</td><td>当我喜欢时，当它是必要时。这其中涉及的内容太多，我现在无法向你解释太 多。</td></tr><tr><td>(I tried to lead Seth on once more.</td><td>(我试图再次地把赛斯引到这话题上。)</td></tr><tr><td>("Are you ever in a chemical state on this plane?")</td><td>("在这个层面上，你是否以化学状态存在过？")</td></tr><tr><td>Rarely.There are just too many interconnections.This will have to wait for later sessions.On your plane mental enzymes cause many chemical reactions.On some other planes the mental enzymes are unnecessary, since the personality on a conscious level can work such transformations; and here again we run into an apparent contradiction, because while these transformations occur consciously on certain levels it is also true that the personalities concerned do not have to be conscious of the transformations.But they can be if they prefer.</td><td>很少。相互之间的连结太多。这得等以后的课再说。在你们的层面上，精神酵素 会引起许多化学反应。在其他一些层面上，精神酵素是不必要的，因为处在意识 层次上的人格，可以进行这样的转化；这里，我们又遇到了一个明显的矛盾，因 为虽然这些转化，在某些层面上，是有意识地发生，但相关的人格不必意识到这 些转化，也是事实。但如果他们愿意，他们也可以意识到。</td></tr><tr><td>On your plane such transformations are carried on without the awareness of the ego with which you are familiar, and therefore other mechanisms become necessary.On some planes the inner senses are the only senses, because all other necessities vanish since the inner senses function at greatest capacity.</td><td>在你们的层面上，这样的转化，是在你们所熟悉的自我未觉察的情况下进行的， 因此，其他的机制变得必要。在某些层面上，内在感官是唯一的感官，因为内在 感官以最大的能力运作着，所有其他必要条件都消失了。</td></tr><tr><td>It is one thing to recognize that your particular camouflage patterns are part of reality and another to realize that there is a reality that is independent of your camouflage patterns.One of my purposes is to enable you not only to recognize but experience this independent reality, and again the use of psychological time in a correct manner will be an invaluable aid.</td><td>认识到你们这特定的伪装模式是实相的一部分，是一回事，认识到有一个独立于 你们伪装模式的实相，是另一回事。我的目的之一，是让你不仅能认识到，而且 能体验到这种独立的实相，再次强调，正确地运用心理时间，会是一种无价的助 援。</td></tr><tr><td>This does not in any way absolve you from using your outer senses to their fullest capacity.If you recall, your outer senses, Joseph, tipped you off as to a message that your inner senses had been endeavoring to deliver.The falling tree incident is what I am referring to, and often there is such a completed circle when the outer senses will return you to inner data.</td><td>这丝毫不能免除你使用外在感官到最大极限。如果你回想一下，约瑟，你的外在 感官在对你通风报信你内在感官一直在努力传递的讯息。我指的就是树倒下来的 那件事，当外在感官会让你回到内在的资讯时，往往有这样一个完整的循环。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's voice now was practically normal.During our sessions we no longer kept the curtains drawn.After each turn through the living room, Jane had been pausing to look out one of our windows at the rather busy intersection of Water and Walnut Streets, one house away.Now as she dictated she remained at the window looking out. )"</td><td>(珍现在的声音可说是正常的。在我们的课程期间，我们不再拉上窗帘。每次转到 客厅时，珍都会停下脚步，从我们其中的一扇窗户向外望去，望着一栋房子之外，华特街和胡桃街相当繁忙的十字路口。现在，当她传述时，她停在窗前，向 外看着。)</td></tr><tr><td>Direct experience through use of the inner senses at full capacity could be likened to the following example.</td><td>通过全力运用内在感官的直接经验，可以比喻为以下的例子。</td></tr><tr><td>Imagine looking at a scene outside your window as Ruburt now allows me to do.From Ruburt's viewpoint he receives the visual image with auditory effects.A slightly cold draft of air leaks in through the window.He does not smell anything from the outside.With use of the complete set of inner senses the experience would be to you astonishingly more rich, varied, direct, and instantly instructive.</td><td>想像着看着窗外的景象，如同鲁伯现在允许我这样看一样。从鲁伯的视角来看， 他接收的是带有听觉效果的视觉图象。一股微寒的气流从窗户渗进来。他没有闻 到外面的任何气味。通过使用完整的内在感官，这经验对你来说将是惊人的更丰 富、多样、直接和更具即刻的启发性。</td></tr><tr><td>This last is extraordinarily important and I shall return to it shortly.Through the inner senses, and using a very simple analogy, you would not only see the street as you do or hear the few sounds that drift to your ears.You would actually experience directly the essence of everything within a certain range.This experience would be instantaneous and would, using the analogy, include more than the usual data that you would receive from the outer senses.That is, not only would you be able to feel the air though you were not out in it, not only would you pick up the odors, though ordinarily you cannot do this while you look out through closed windows, but you would literally feel the unitary essences of the trees and branches and hidden birds and insects.You would experience directly the personalities of the inhabitants of the automobilesâthe vitality even of the components of the automobiles' molecules, and "see" (in quotes) the future and the past experience of everything within that particular range of focus.And the range itself would be much larger.</td><td>最后这一点格外重要，我很快就会回到这点上。通过内在感官，用一个非常简单 的比喻，你不仅会像现在这样看到街道，或听到飘进你耳边的一些声音。你实际 上会直接经验，在一定范围内的事物的本质。这种经验将是即时的，用个比喻， 这经验所包括的讯息，将比你从外在感官接收到的一般讯息还要多。也就是说， 你不仅能感受到空气，虽然你并不在室外，不仅能闻到气味，这通常透过关着的 窗户往外看时，无法闻到的，而且你会实实在在地感受到树木和树干以及藏匿的 鸟儿和昆虫们的统一本质。你会直接体验到车内住户的人格--甚至汽车分子成分 的活力，并"看到"(加引号)在这个特定焦点范围内，一切事物的未来和过去的 经验。而这范围本身则是会大得多。</td></tr><tr><td>Now as for my remark about learning.This whole experience would be so vivid that it would be impressed upon your personality pattern with such impact and clearness that you would never forget it.</td><td>至于我说的学习。这整个经历会非常生动，会在你的人格模式中留下深刻的影响 和清晰的印象，让你永远不会忘记。</td></tr><tr><td>Some vivid, usually unfortunate, experiences on your plane will serve as further examples of this in that oftentimes a severe fright or psychological assault will be so vivid that the personality who has it can never forget it.</td><td>在你们的层面上，一些栩栩如生，但通常是不幸的经验，会进一步成为这样的例 子，在很多时候，严重的惊吓或心理上的攻击是如此地鲜明，以至于拥有这种经 历的人格，永远无法忘记它。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner experience of which I speak would not be frightening, although it would be frightening in the extreme if you were not prepared for it.The fact is that you would experience these other live things as if you were part of them.You would know them directly.No one would have to teach you about the oneness of all living things, or the brotherhood of man.The lesson would be instantaneous and complete.</td><td>我所说的内在体验不会令人害怕，但是如果你没做好准备的话，它将会是极端吓 人的。事实上，你体验这些其它生灵活物时，会好像你是它们的一部分。你会直 接了解它们。没有人必须教你众生一体，或人类的兄弟情谊。这学习将会是瞬间 而且是完整的。</td></tr><tr><td>("How much of this will we ever be able to approach on this plane?")</td><td>("在这个层面上，我们能在多大程度上做到这一点？")</td></tr><tr><td>You should approach a fair approximation, which would represent to you an astounding degree of change for the better.It would be impossible for you to experience such inner abilities to the degree that I mentioned, while on your plane.Nevertheless even fair progress would represent a world gain.</td><td>你们应该能达到相当接近的程度，对你们来说，这将代表着一个令人震惊的改善 程度。在你们的层面上，你不可能经验到我提到的这种内在能力的程度。然而， 即使是些许的进步，也代表着整个世界的获益。</td></tr><tr><td>The use of certain drugs has been experimented with at various times through the ages, but these provide merely an undisciplined, intriguing glimpse into what is possible; and for some time in your future they will not be either practical or in the main beneficial, for reasons that I shall go into after you take your break.</td><td>古往今来，人们在不同时期，都曾尝试过使用某些药物，但这些只是对可能的情 况，提供了一个涣散的、奇妙的一瞥；在你们未来的一段时间里，这些药物既不 实用，也没什么大的好处，其原因我将在你们休息后再谈。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:16.

January, and in this case it will end this month.It is partly the expression of seasonal change.However you do have my sympathy, and Ruburt now is certainly not being ordered.Nevertheless I most respectfully request that the assault end.</td><td>鲁伯的家具袭击，开始于一月左右。它总是从一月左右开始，在这种情况下，它 将在这个月结束。这部分是季节变化的表现。然而你确实得到了我的同情，鲁伯 现在肯定不受指挥。尽管如此，我还是非常恭敬地请求结束袭击。</td></tr><tr><td>His bursts of nervous energy usually begin in January and are somewhat the result of chemicals that appear in the air at that time.Much of this energy is channeled into his work, but when there is trouble or a lag, then look out.Nevertheless if you can believe it this siege is about over, the energy itself finding much more beneficial outlet in the poetry which comes with a splurge at the end of March as a rule.</td><td>他神经质式的能量爆发，通常从一月开始，多少是因为当时空气中出现的化学物 造成的结果。这股能量大部分被引导到他的工作上，但当有麻烦或延滞的时候， 就要小心了。不过，如果你能相信的话，这个围困就要结束了，能量本身会在诗 里找到更有益的出口，通常会在 3 月底倾泻释放。</td></tr><tr><td>The constant furniture moving certainly bothers you, Joseph.Except for the definite inconvenience which it causes you and for the energy lost, it is not seriously detrimental.Used judiciously, it can be a good outlet for excess nervous energy; but not, dear Ruburt, day after day after day.Do you want to be a poet or a furniture mover?I do suggest strongly now that you desist.My comments on this matter hereby end.</td><td>不断搬动家具肯定困扰着你，约瑟。它除了肯定会带来的不便和能量耗损外，并 没有严重的危害。审慎地使用，它可以很好地发泄多余的焦虑能量；但亲爱的鲁伯，不是日复一日地这么做。你是想当诗人还是想当家具搬运工？我现在强烈建 议你停止。我对此事的意见，就到此结束。</td></tr><tr><td>"Joseph can be glad that Ruburt now tosses furniture and not rocks, though the assault incidentally is not directed against any person.Good aggressive energy that should go into Ruburt's work is often misused.You can see the power of this energy in a more or less visible manner when it is demonstrated in this physical way.This same energy is used in Ruburt's writing and is extremely strong, powerful and stormy often; and he is not, Joseph, trying to get out of his room as I believe you mentioned earlier."</td><td>约瑟可以庆幸，鲁伯现在扔的是家具而不是石头，而且正好这袭击不是针对任何 人。好的激进能量，应该进入鲁伯的工作中，却常常被滥用。当这种能量以这种 物质方式表现出来的时候，你就可以或多或少地看到这种能量的威力。这种能量 也同样是被用在鲁伯的写作中，而且往往如风暴般的强劲有力；而他并不是想走 出自己的房间，约瑟，如我相信你之前提到过的那样。</td></tr><tr><td>(I had mentioned this thought to Jane several hours ago, thinking that if she needed an exclusive workroom there was no

有障碍，就没有时间。</td></tr><tr><td>Now basically, consciousness itself is a type of barrier, and anything that has consciousness experiences time to some degree.This degree may be so slight that to you it would not seem to exist at all.Self-consciousness presents a larger barrier, therefore the sense of time is greater.Psychological time is the lowest common denominator, so to speak, from your viewpoint.That is, many of the barriers disappear.Psychological time represents on your plane the closest you can come to the experience of timelessness as far as your physical laws are concerned.</td><td>基本上，意识本身就是一种障碍，任何有意识的东西，都会在某种程度上经历时 间。这个程度可能是如此轻微，以至于对你们来说，它似乎根本不存在。自身意 识呈现的障碍更大，因此时间感也更强。可以这么说，从你们的角度来看，心理 时间是最小的公分母。也就是说，很多障碍都消失了。心理时间在你们的层面 上，代表了就你的物理规律而言，你能达到的最接近无时间的体验。</td></tr><tr><td>You do experience time, but not time as it is bound by your camouflage patterns.As I have mentioned you can in a dream or daydream or through conscious use of psychological time experience many hours in a few clock minutes.This experience comes very close to the third inner sense.If you will remember again our imaginary experience through the inner senses as we looked down at the street, you will remember that I spoke of sensing not only the present essence of the living consciousness within a certain scope, but I also mentioned sensing their past and futures.</td><td>你确实会经历时间，但不是受你们伪装模式所束缚的那种时间。如我说过的，你 能在梦境或白日梦中，或者通过有意识地运用心理时间，在钟表时间的几分钟内，经历好几个小时。这种经验非常接近于第三种内在感官。如果你再回想一 下，当我们俯瞰街头，透过内在感官而来的想像经验，你会记得我说的，不仅能 感知到一定范围内活生生的意识的当下本质，并且我也说，还能感知它们的过去 和未来。</td></tr><tr><td>This sensing would have been done by the third inner sense, in conjunction of course with other senses, and this perception of past, present and future would not take any clock time, at least not theoretically.You I doubt will ever have such an experience completely.There will always be some clock time involved for you.</td><td>这种感知会由第三内在感官完成，当然也结合了其他的内在感官，这种对过去、 现在和未来的感知，不需要任何钟表时间，至少在理论上不需要。我很怀疑你会 有这样的完整经验。对你们来说，总会涉及到一些钟表时间。</td></tr><tr><td>Since our imagined experience would depend upon all of the inner senses working together in a complex, near-perfect manner, that I doubt you could achieve at this stage.This experiencing of past, present and future would seem to be unwilled, almost automatic.If you were to have it or one like it, it would seem as if a door suddenly for no reason opened and then just as abruptly closed.This would not be the case however.</td><td>因为我们想像的经历，将有赖于所有的内在感官以一种复杂的、近乎完美的方式 一起运作，我怀疑你在现阶段能否做到这一点。这种对过去、现在和未来的经 历，似乎不是刻意的，几乎是自动的。如果你有过或类似的经历，那就好像一扇 门，突然无缘无故地打开，然后又突然地关上。然而，情况不会是这样的。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner ego or the inner self-conscious self directs such experiences and uses the inner senses in much the same way that you use the outer senses, except that the inner ego knows all of the mechanics involved in the use of the inner senses, and you know little of the mechanics involved with the outer senses.</td><td>内在自我或内在自身意识的自己，指挥着这样的经验和运用内在感官，方式就像 你使用外在感官一样，只是内在的自我知道所有使用内在感官所涉及的机制，而 你对使用外在感官所涉及的机制，所知甚少。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break.</td><td>我建议稍作休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:30.Jane was dissociated as usual.Looking out our living room window just then, I saw the service truck from the TV cable company parked there.Jane had called them earlier because our reception had been poor ever since the falling tree limb of March 6 had ripped down the line.Servicemen had been to the house several times in an effort to improve the reception.Jane particularly missed the channel for music only, since she was used to working by this in the mornings.</td><td>(9:30 休息。珍解离如常。从客厅的窗户往外看，我看到有线电视公司的工程车停在那里。珍之前给他们打过电话，因为自从 3 月 6 日那根大树枝倒下，扯断电缆线后，我们电视接收的信号就一直很差。服务人员来过家里几次，努力改善接收 效果。珍特别怀念那专门播放音乐的频道，因为她习惯于早上一边工作，一边听 这个音乐频道。</td></tr><tr><td>(We were surprised now to see anyone working at this hour of the night.And of course we immediately thought of the session being interrupted.At 9:33, Seth interrupted break to deliver the following through Jane:)</td><td>(我们很讶异，这么晚了还看到有人在工作。当然我们马上想到课程被打断了。9 点 33 分，赛斯打断了休息时间，通过珍传达了以下信息：)。</td></tr><tr><td>The music is more important to Ruburt than either of you know.If the man comes let him in.I will be with you but quiet, and I would be curious in any case.Perhaps I will tell you about your TV man.So be quiet, kind hearts.</td><td>音乐对于鲁伯，比你们以为的还更加重要。如果工人来了，就让他进来吧。我会 安静地和你们在一起，不管怎样，我都会很好奇。也许我会告诉你们关于那电视 工程人员的事。所以安静点，善良的心。</td></tr><tr><td>(At 9:34 the service truck moved to the back of our house; we could see a man with a flashlight checking wires, etc.  , but no one knocked on our door.Jane resumed dictation at 9:35.And here again, her first few sentences answered the question in my own mind.)</td><td>(9:34，工程车开到我们家后面，我们可以看到一个人拿着手电筒检查电线等，但 没有人敲门。9:35，珍继续传述。这里再一次地，她一开始的几句话，就回答了 我脑海中的问题。)</td></tr><tr><td>A point I wanted to add, Joseph.What you actually felt when the tree fell was the pain of the tree, in much muted form.The tree while dead still had consciousness.As a rule you will usually have such experiences to begin with through one inner sense.You are not adept enough yet to recognize inner data from more than one direction at a time.</td><td>我想补充一点，约瑟。当树倒下的时候，你实际感受到的是树的痛苦，一种缄默 无声的形式。树虽然死了，但仍是有意识的。一般来说，透过一种内在感官，你 一开始通常会有这样的经验。你还没有熟练到可以同时认出来自多个方向的内在 资讯。</td></tr><tr><td>You may have experiences through all of the inner senses but not at once.This is a great simplification.What I should perhaps add for the sake of clearness is that you will not as a rule be aware of data that comes to you through more than one sense, inner sense, at a time.</td><td>你也许已透过所有的内在感官获得了些经验，但不是同时做到的。这说法太简 化。为了清楚起见，我或许应该补充一点，你通常不会同时意识到，通过一个以 上的感官，内在感官，传给你的资讯。</td></tr><tr><td>The fact is that the whole self is constantly experiencing data from all of the inner senses.The inner ego is of course aware of this.The subconscious is sometimes aware of this, and the outer ego is aware of very little.I have explained the reasons for this in past sessions.The outer ego must concentrate much of its energy toward survival in and manipulation of the outer camouflage world.This world has already been created by the inner self, and its continuing existence is determined by the constant vigilance of the inner self.</td><td>事实上，整体自己一直在不断地体验来自所有内在感官的资讯。内在自我当然意 识到这一点。潜意识有时也能觉察，但外在自我却知道的很少。我在过去的课程 中已经解释过这方面的原因。外在的自我必须将大部分的能量集中在外在伪装世 界的生存和操控上。内在自己已经创建了这个世界，而世界的继续存在，则取决 于内在自己持续不断的警觉。</td></tr><tr><td>Only when a certain level of confidence is reached can the outer ego afford to become familiar with these inner workings, at least on your plane.Otherwise you would falter.As a rule, even though the whole self is capable of organizing the data from all of the inner senses, the subconscious can rarely receive such communications full blast; and the outer ego, concerned as it is with camouflage pattern, and really born to deal with camouflage pattern, simply could not stand the shock of realization that a complete set of inner senses would bring.</td><td>只有当信心达到一定程度时，外在自我才有余力去熟悉这些内在的运作，至少在 你们的层面上是如此。否则你们会趑趄不前。通常情况下，即使整体自己有能力 组织所有内在感官的资讯，但潜意识却很少能全力以赴地接收这种交流；而外在 的自我，关注的是伪装模式，实在是生来就是为了对付伪装模式，根本无法承受 一套完整的内在感官所带来的认知冲击。</td></tr><tr><td>This sort of experience will always be shielded from the outer ego of necessity.Even a watered-down version of a direct inner experience is a shock to the outer ego on your plane, since the ego imagines itself and its own perceptions to be supreme.You have no idea, even with what training you have, of how shattering such a complete experience would be to the outer ego, so we will take one inner-sense experience at a time.</td><td>这样的经历，必然会被屏蔽在外在自我之外。即使是稀释版的直接内在经验，对 你们层面上的外在自我来说，也是一种冲击，因为自我把他自己和自己的感知想 像成至高无上的。你不知道，即使你有什么训练，这样一个完整的经历，对于外 在自我会有多大的震撼，所以我们将一次只取一个内在感官的经验。</td></tr><tr><td>("I wasn't aware of any feeling of shock when the tree came down this afternoon.  ")</td><td>("今天下午树倒的时候，我没感到什么震惊的感觉)。</td></tr><tr><td>You were feeling the echo of distant pain.The experience was of very low volume, had almost dreamlike existence in one dimension only, and represented an echo of anguish heard centuries after the original cry.</td><td>你感觉到的，是遥远的痛苦的回声。这个经验的感受度很低，只在一个维度上， 近乎梦境般的存在，代表着痛苦的回声，最初的哭声在几世纪之后才被听见。</td></tr><tr><td>("Centuries?")</td><td>("几个世纪？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Centuries after the original cry.That is, the strength of the inner sensual impact was as weakened and diluted as it would have been if what you heard was a cry through the outer ear that came originally from centuries already gone by.</td><td>在最初的哭声之后的几个世纪。也就是说，如果你听到的是通过外耳传来的哭 声，而这哭声原本是来自于已经过去的几个世纪，那么，内心感性冲击的力量就 会被削弱和稀释。</td></tr><tr><td>("How about the man who cut down the tree with the power saw?Did he feel anything?")</td><td>("那位用电锯砍树的人如何？他有什么感觉吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>The man as he knows himself felt hardly anything.His inner self knew, as the inner self is always aware of such endings.</td><td>他所知道的自己，几乎没有任何感觉。他的内在自己知道，因为内在自己总是觉 察到这种结局。</td></tr><tr><td>Had you experienced the pain of the tree as directly and as immediately as you would sense another person's pain through the ordinary senses you could not have stood it.It would be like the tearing away of your own limbs.Nor is this in any sense a distortion or an exaggeration.</td><td>如果你直接并立即经历树的痛苦，如同你通过普通的感官，感知另一个人的痛 苦，你将无法忍受。那就像撕裂自己的肢体一样。这在任何意义上都不是歪曲或 夸张。</td></tr><tr><td>Full use of the inner senses is not even for me yet.There is still a long way for me to go.We progress along these lines according to our capabilities and our own strengths.The conscious ego also develops in a strange manner through all this, as I will now attempt to explain.</td><td>我自己都尚未充分运用那些内在感官。对我来说，还有很长的路要走。我们根据 我们的能力和我们自己的力量沿着这些路线前进。有意识的自我也通过这一切， 以一种奇怪的方式发展，我现在就试着解释。</td></tr><tr><td>Through experience in the various levels of existence the inner ego and the outer ego come closer and closer together.The subconscious eventually disappears, as it is no longer needed as a necessary buffer zone.At your stage of development the inner ego is by far the most self-conscious part of the whole self, and has the greatest ability for perception and organization.It alone is capable of experiencing inner and basic reality directly and immediately.It alone can cope with the tumultuous nature of such direct reality experience.</td><td>通过在不同层次的存在的经验，内在自我和外在自我越来越贴近。潜意识最终会 消失，因为它不再需要充当一个必要的缓冲区。在你们的发展阶段，内在自我， 是迄今为止，整体自己中最有自觉意识的部分，且有最大的感知和组织能力。只 有它能够直接并即时地体验内在的基本实相。只有它能应对这种直接实相体验的 汹涌彭湃。</td></tr><tr><td>You had better break before you break your wrist.My sweet pickle heads, you are so sweet and sour at the same time.</td><td>在你累断(break 断掉)手腕之前，最好先休息(break 休息)一下。我可爱的酸黄瓜，你们真是又甜又酸。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:07.Jane was dissociated as usual.She delivered the underlined material above by pounding on the table as she spoke.Jane felt we had been experiencing foreshortened time.She said that with this kind of material Seth has to open her up more than usual to get it through, that he gets her into a conceptual framework state of mind.</td><td>(10:07 休息。珍解离如常。她边说边拍着桌子，发表了上面划线的资料。珍觉得我们经历了时间的缩短。她说，对于这种资料，赛斯要比平时更要让她敞开，以 便资讯能透过来，他让她进入一种概念架构的心智状态。</td></tr><tr><td>(The service man from the TV cable company was still working at the back of the house.Jane resumed at 10:17.)</td><td>(电视电缆公司的工作人员还在屋后工作。珍 10:17 继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>In the various levels of existence the inner and outer egos begin to merge.Gradually direct experience of inner reality is spoon-fed by the inner ego through the mouth of the subconscious to the outer ego.The division between the inner and outer egos is necessary for other reasons than the nature of direct experience itself.That is, the outer ego is shielded from direct experience of reality because it could not take the impact of such experience.But this is not the only reason.</td><td>在存在的不同层次中，内在和外在的自我开始融合。渐渐地，内在实相的直接经 验，由内在自我通过潜意识的嘴，一匙一匙地喂给外在的自我。内在自我和外在自我之间的分野是必要的，除了直接经验本身的性质之外，还有其他原因。也就 是说，外在自我被屏蔽在实相的直接经验之外，因为它无法承受这种经验的冲击。但这不是唯一的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>(At 10:22 the TV serviceman knocked on the door, just as Jane finished the above sentence.He spent several minutes checking reception on our set while we talked with him.He was on duty until 11:00 PM.He left at 10:30.Jane rested briefly, for she could not make the switch back to Seth that quick, then resumed dictating at 10:31.)</td><td>(10:22，就在珍说完上面这句话候，工作人员来敲门。我们和他交谈的同时，他花 了几分钟时间检查了我们电视机的收讯情况。他值班到晚上 11 点。他在 10:30 离开。珍略作休息，因为她无法那么快切换到赛斯，然后在 10:31 继续传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>The subconsciousâto finish what I beganâthe subconscious cushions the outer ego really against the shock of true reality.If sometimes it seems to you that you are living in a dream world, in many respects you are.You are not strong enough yet to bear the brunt of basic reality, and you construct complicated dream worlds in order to find shelter from what would appear to you as savage, uncontrolled and undisciplined chaos.</td><td>潜意识 - 完成我开始说的 - 潜意识，确实缓冲了真正实相对外在自我的冲击。如果有时你觉得自己似乎生活在梦的世界中，在很多方面，你的确是如此。你还没 有强大到足以承受基本实相的冲击，你构建了复杂的梦世界，以便从在你看来是 野蛮的、不受控制的、没有纪律的混乱中找到庇护。</td></tr><tr><td>(For the next four paragraphs, I experienced many instances of what I thought might be telepathy between Jane and me.I did not receive whole sentences from her, but often would seem to pick out the exact words of a phrase just before she gave voice to them.)</td><td>(在接下来的四个段落中，我经历了许多我认为可能是我和珍之间的心灵感应的例 子。我并没有从她那里收到整句话，但常常在她开口之前，似乎就能抓到句中的确切用语。)</td></tr><tr><td>Basic reality is not uncontrolled, savage, undisciplined or chaotic, but if you were suddenly confronted with it at your present state of development you would be like a straw in a hurricane.But because of your weakness, the various levels of existence merely prepare you and equip you for the experience of true reality, of which you have but a glimmering.</td><td>基本实相并不是失控、野蛮、无纪律或混乱的，但就你们目前发展的状态，如果 你突然面对它，你就会像飓风中的一根稻草。各种层次的存在，只是为你准备和 装备你，让你体验真正的实相，但由于你们的脆弱，你们对实相仅得隐约的一瞥。</td></tr><tr><td>To the extent that you are able to allow yourselves to be aware of data received by the inner senses, you are preparing yourself and are that far ahead.You remember, Joseph, the rather frightening sensation you felt during one instance of your use of one inner sense, when you translated inner data into the almost nightmare picture of open mouths that could not scream.This is but a minute instance.</td><td>只要你们能够允许自己觉知内在感官所接收到的资料，你们就在为自己做准备， 而且是遥遥领先。约瑟，你还记得，在你使用一个内在感官的例子中，你感觉到 的那相当吓人的感觉，当你把内在资讯转译成，张开的嘴无法尖叫如噩梦般的画 面。这只是一个小小的例子。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not mean to mislead you.Basic reality is not by nature terrifying.It is however vibrant and direct to the extreme, and you must be prepared before you experience such an ultrasonic action.A direct experience of reality involves complete use of all the inner senses to an integrated cognizance field.A very weak analogy can be found if you imagine at one time hearing the most exciting and moving music imaginable, while simultaneously smelling the strongest but not necessarily unpleasant odor, viewing the most emotionally-charged scene while feeling intense and vivid bodily sensations.In normal life you even turn down outer-sense stimuli for the sake of simplicity, and to enable you to focus upon those stimuli close at hand.</td><td>我无意误导你。基本实相本质上并不可怕。然而，它的活力和直接性达到了极 致，你在经历这样的超音速行动之前，必须先做好准备。对实相的直接体验，牵 涉到全然地运用所有的内在感官到一个综合的认知场域中。可以举一个不太有力 的例子，想像一下你在同一时刻，听到了能想像到的最精彩动人的音乐，同时闻 到了最浓烈但不一定是难闻的气味，观看了最具情感的一幕，同时感受到了强烈而鲜活的肉体感觉。在平常的生活中，为了简单起见，你甚至会关掉外在感官的 刺激，以便能专注于那些近在手边的刺激。</td></tr><tr><td>You would find it difficult to attend to or be aware of regular outer stimuli while you dealt with the ordinary function of daily life.Is it then any wonder that the outer ego leaves the inner data to the safekeeping of the inner ego?You are truly babes in the woods, having enough trouble getting along in your own universe.And do not get your feelings hurt, I am not referring to either of you in particular, as you should know by now.</td><td>你会发现，当你在处理日常生活的一般功能时，很难关注或意识到普通的外部刺 激。那么外在自我将内在资讯留给内在自我保管，有任何奇怪之处吗？你们真是 树林中的宝贝(译注:意指天真无邪, 没有经验, 容易受骗的人)，在你们自己的世界中已有足够的麻烦了。不要觉得受到伤害，我并不是特别指你们中的任何一个， 你们现在应该知道的。</td></tr><tr><td>As the intense experience of great joy or pain often blots out everything else, so would the direct experience of reality blot out, only completely, the outer ego who experienced it directly.At your level the sieve of the subconscious is a necessity and that is one of the main reasons why Ruburt dissociates during our sessions, even though his experience of inner reality is received second handed, so to speak, through me.</td><td>就像狂喜或剧痛的强烈经验，往往掩蔽住其他的一切，同样地，实相的直接经验 也会掩蔽直接经验它的外在自我，只是更为彻底。在你们的层次上，潜意识的筛 子是必要的，这也是为什么鲁伯在我们的上课期间要解离的主要原因之一，即使 他内在实相的经验，也是透过我而取得的二手经验，可以这么说。</td></tr><tr><td>It is thinned out further by my own subconscious, because my inner and outer egos are not yet a complete unity, although I am, or my outer ego is, in direct contact with my inner ego on some occasions.Nevertheless my subconscious is not yet dispensed with but is still retained somewhat in the order of your archaic appendix.</td><td>它已被我自己的潜意识进一步稀释过了，因为我的内在和外在的自我还不是一个 完整的统一体，虽然我，或者说，我的外在自我，在某些情况下，是与我的内在 自我直接接触的。尽管如此，我的潜意识还没有被免除，仍然保留着，有点像你 们那没用的盲肠。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt is letting me through well this evening and I find my feelings for both of you most affectionate.This material, you will find, will begin and only begin to fill in the outline on the inner senses.We will still take many sessions before you attain any real understanding of these matters, and my dear big gibbons, I hope to add to our lectures with exercises in the experience of the various inner senses as we go along.</td><td>鲁伯今晚让我顺利地透过来，我发现我对你们俩的感觉是很深情的。你们会发 现，这些资料将开始，而且只是开始勾勒关于内在感官的大纲而已。我们还需要 好几节课，才能让你们对这些事情有真正的理解。我亲爱的大长臂猿们，我希望 在我们的讲课中，加入一些各种不同的内在感官经验的练习。</td></tr><tr><td>Such exercises as a rule will not take up time during sessions however, but will appear at other occasions, consume hardly any clock time at all, and seem spontaneous.As preparation I suggest that your reread the material given so far on the inner senses, the first, second and third.We will go into the other inner senses at future sessions.</td><td>然而这样的练习，在课程期间，通常不会占用时间，在其他场合，也几乎不消耗 任何钟表时间，似乎是自发的。作为准备，我建议你重读到目前为止，我所给出 的关于第一、第二和第三内在感官的资料。我们会在以后的课程中讨论其他的内 在感官。</td></tr><tr><td>Your exercises will in no way be frightening.In ordinary circumstances you will only let through as much of the actual experience as you have knowledge and strength and ability to deal with.This is another reason for my disinclination to suggest the use of any drugs, and for my definite advice against them.</td><td>你们这个练习绝不会让人害怕。在一般情况下，你只会根据自己的知识、力量和 能力所及的程度，让实际经历通过来。这是我不建议使用任何药物，以及我明确 反对使用药物的另一个原因。</td></tr><tr><td>When the ego is artificially forced to let such experiences through then it is in severe danger.I suggest a break.</td><td>当自我被人为地逼着让这样的经历通过时，那是极危险的。我建议休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:01.Jane was dissociated as usual.We talked about Jane asking Bill MacDonnell to be a witness to next Wednesday's session.Bill had agreed.We also wondered whether Seth would say anything about our TV repairman.Resume at 11:08. )"</td><td>(11:01 休息。珍解离如常。我们讨论了珍邀请比尔·麦唐纳做课上证人的事。比尔已同意了。我们还想知道，赛斯是否会说些关于我们的电视维修工的事。11:08 继续)。</td></tr><tr><td>You have no need to worry whenever witnesses are present.If I may say so at the risk of showing lack of humility, I will maintain the peacefulness of our sessions and dominate any other personalities with a minimum of effort on my part.</td><td>有证人在场的时候，你们不必担心。冒着显得不够谦虚的风险，恕我这么说，我

left foot.One of the bones.</td><td>你们的电视修理工有 3 个孩子，心地善良，左脚有些问题。毛病并不明显，但他的左脚是有问题。其中一根骨头有问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(Does he know it?")</td><td>(他知道吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>No.</td><td>不知道</td></tr><tr><td>(After the session Jane said she tried to be very careful about passing on the above information, because she is always afraid

correct.)</td><td>(课后珍说，她试着非常小心地传递上述信息，因为在这样的情况下，她总是怕歪 曲了事实。我们都不认识这个维修人员，也没有见过他。直到今日 3 月 18 日为止，我们还没有用任何方式去核实信息是否正确。)</td></tr><tr><td>You will find, Joseph, that you have acquired added strength and you will be able to act positively in your dealing with the outside world.I will say nothing more of this here.</td><td>约瑟，你会发现，你已经获取了额外的力量，在与外界打交道时，将能够积极地 采取行动。这我就不再多说了。</td></tr><tr><td>"My Piggly Wigglies, you have received some excellent material this evening, if I do say so myself.And what of your trip to your brother's?"</td><td>我的小猪猪，今晚你们收到了一些很棒的资料，如果要我自己说的话。你去你哥

not.</td><td>不过，不要指望他是你的翻版，因为他显然不是。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not want to go into other inner sense material this evening as it is too late to begin on the fourth inner sense.Try and use psychological time as I have told you.This is extremely valuable, for it is the channel through which all other inner data must come at your particular stage.</td><td>今晚我不想再讲其他的内在感官资料，因为现在开始讲第四内在感官已经太晚 了。照我告诉你的那样，试着运用心理时间。那是极有价值的，因为在你们这个 特定阶段，它是所有其他内在资料必经过的通道。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt, as I mentioned earlier, has always felt a kinetic unity with the earth, and experiences in a watered-down fashion the seasonal burying of seeds.This results in a claustrophobic reaction that is lessened with the coming of your spring.</td><td>鲁伯，如我先前所说，一直觉得自己与大地的脉动合一，并以一种淡化的方式经 历着季节性的埋藏种子。这导致了一种幽闭反应，而这种幽闭反应会随着你们春

your plane only.Because of magnetic properties your molecules are aligned with greater efficiency.I certainly do not like to go into household matters.A point, however: Your bed should never be in your main room.Not only do you have lack of privacy, one of Ruburt's squawks, and not only should various biological functions be separated on your plane as I have suggested, but the room itself, while excellent for some purposes involving use of the intellect, is simply not good for sleeping.</td><td>睡觉时头朝北是极好的，但只在你们的层面。由于磁场的特性，你们的分子会以 更高的效率校准排列。我确实不喜欢谈家务事。但有一点：床绝对不能放在主厅。不仅缺乏私密性，而这也是鲁伯发牢骚的原因之一，也不仅是各种生物功 能，在你们的层面上，应该像我所建议的那样分开，而且房间本身，虽然对于某 些涉及使用知性的目的来说是很好的，但它根本不适合用来睡觉。</td></tr><tr><td>The back room is the best for sleeping. However it is also the best for your working purposes, Joseph.

"</td><td>("这句话要画上记号(mark the mark)，马克(Mark)到了。"8:50 分，这句话进到了珍的脑海里。她说她几乎懒得告诉我这件事，她不确定这句话是否来自赛斯。如果 这是赛斯在课前发来的讯息，那她的内在，没有像平常那样，听得很清楚。她自 己的想法是，这表示比尔在课开始后的某个时刻到达。</td></tr><tr><td>(At 9:00 PM Bill had not arrived.I for one was quite upset by this.Jane was not beginning the session, either.She did say, "I feel a great humorous sense of waiting that isn't mine." She said this concept hung above her.As the minutes passed she began to pace slowly back and forth.At 9:05 she began to dictate.Throughout the session her voice was a bit stronger than normal, her pace rather slow, her eyes dark as usual.)</td><td>(晚上 9 点，比尔还没到。我很不高兴。珍也没有开始这一节。但她说："我感到一种幽默感十足的等候，那感觉不是我的。"她说这个想法悬在她头上。随着时间 的推移，她开始慢慢地来回踱步。到了 9:05，她开始传述。整个过程中，她的声音比平时有力一些，步伐相当缓慢，眼睛如往常一样黑。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>I have waited for your friend long enough.Five whole minutes.You cannot say that I am unwilling to make concessions, though I must admit that five minutes is my limit.</td><td>我等你的朋友已经够久了。整整五分钟。你不能说我不愿意做出让步，但是我必 须承认，五分钟是我的极限。</td></tr><tr><td>I am of course pleased about Ruburts letter.As I mentioned earlier I am extremely leery about trying to get predictions through to you, and therefore at this point I do not try.I do not want to be blamed for any distortions that might arise, though at a later time Ruburt will be able to get this sort of material through without such distortion.</td><td>我当然对鲁伯的信感到高兴。正如我先前提到的，要把预测传达给你们，我是非 常谨慎的，因此在这一点上，我并没有尝试。我不想为可能出现的任何歪曲而受 到指责，不过鲁伯以后会有能力将这类资料传过来而不致失真。</td></tr><tr><td>(The letter Seth referred to was one from Jane's publisher, received today, concerning her book on ESP.Jane had thought the project dead, but it seems the publisher is still interested.)</td><td>(赛斯提到的这封信，是珍今天收到的来自出版商的信，是关于她写的超感官知 觉的书。珍原以为没希望了，但似乎出版商仍然感兴趣。)</td></tr><tr><td>Free will as I mentioned earlier certainly does operate, but you must remember that while it does operate, personalities on your plane are extremely limited as to choice.They can only choose between alternatives with which they are familiar.They can only choose to operate within their own camouflage pattern framework.</td><td>如我先前提到的，自由意志，当然，确实在运作，但你们必须记住，虽然它的确 可以运作，但你们层面上的人格，在选择上，是极其有限的。他们只能在自己熟 悉的选项中做选择。他们只能选择在自己的伪装模式架构内运作。</td></tr><tr><td>Free choice therefore is not the wide range experience that you suppose.The possibilities are certainly not endless in any real sense.That is, while in theory any personality can choose to travel extensively, this really has no meaning for a large percentage of personalities because of their own peculiar makeup.</td><td>因此，自由选择并不是你以为的那种广泛的经验。真正意义上的可能性，当然不 是无穷无尽的。也就是说，虽然理论上，任何人格都可以选择四处游走，但由于 他们自身的特殊构成，这对大多数人格来说，其实没有实际的意义。</td></tr><tr><td>Many similar, more or less obvious opportunities of this sort are equally impractical to a large number of personalities.These opportunities exist theoretically, and yet for particular personalities do not exist for all practical purposes.Within certain limits there is free will.Yet these limits themselves were set, or if you prefer, chosen, by the entity itself for any given present personality; and at the entity level free choice or free will is much more extensive, and really has much more meaning.</td><td>许多类似或多少显而易见的这类机会，对许多人格来说，同样是不切实际的。这 些机会在理论上存在，但对于特定的人格来说，在所有的实际的目的中并不存 在。在一定的限度内，是有自由意志。然而这些限制本身，是存有自身为任何特 定的现世人格所设定的，或者如果你喜欢这么说，所选择的；在存有的层次上， 自由选择或自由意志要广泛得多，而且也确实有更多意义。</td></tr><tr><td>So choices between various alternatives are narrow on your level because of other limitations set by the entity itself.In other words, the entity, using its ownâ mark the Mark: Mark has arrived.This is a little instance in which Ruburt did not block me.Let your friend in and request that he be seated.</td><td>因为存有本身所设定的其他限制，所以在你们的层面上，各种替代的选择范围很窄。换句话说，存有，用它自己的 ——记下标记(mark)：马克(Mark)到了。这是个小例子，鲁伯没有阻拦我。让你的朋友进来，请他坐下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane broke off dictation.It was 9:20.Her sudden change in direction had distracted me.While I sat staring at her she said:)</td><td>(珍中断了传述。当时是 9:20。她突然改变方向，让我分心了。我坐在那里盯着她看时，她说：)。</td></tr><tr><td>Please take a brief break if you want discussion among yourselves, though I shall of course listen in avidly.</td><td>如果你们之间要讨论的话，那就休息一下，我肯定会听得津津有味。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane now motioned toward the door.Recovering my wits by now and realizing that the name Mark referred to Bill's entity name, given to us by Seth at our seance, I went to the door and opened it.No one was there.Nor had I heard anyone coming up the stairs.</td><td>(珍现在向门走去。我此刻恢复了机智，意识到马克这个名字，指的是比尔存有的 名字，是赛斯在我们的降神会上告诉我们的，我走到门前，打开门。没有人在那里。我也没有听到有人上楼的声音。</td></tr><tr><td>(By now I was completely puzzled; and Jane, evidently not wanting to speak on her own yet, looked at me and shrugged.We had heard the sound of a car, I remembered, and people going into the apartment downstairs; perhaps that had caused our confusion.I had a peculiar feeling of dismay, as though we had lost control somehow.</td><td>(现在我已经一头雾水了；而珍，显然还不想自己说话，看着我，耸了耸肩。我们 听到了汽车的声音，我想起来，有人进了楼下的公寓；也许这就是我们搞错的原因。我有一股异样的沮丧感，仿佛我们不知何故失去了控制。</td></tr><tr><td>(I went back to my desk.It was 9:21.Jane resumed pacing and dictating.)</td><td>(我回到桌前。时间是 9:21。珍恢复了踱步和传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>If you are ready I will explain the situation, if Ruburt will kindly allow me.It is regrettable, and yet I can give you a checking method that should be used in the future, to check any material in which you find distortions of any kind.</td><td>如果你准备好了，鲁伯也允许我这样做的话，我来解释一下情况。这是令人遗憾 的，但我可以给你一个检验的方法，今后应该用这个方法，来检查任何资料中的 任何形式的扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>First of all, such distortions will almost always occur either in the beginning of a session or toward the end, and distortions in the material itself will not as a rule occur in the middle of sessions.</td><td>首先，这种失真，几乎总是发生在课程的开始或接近结尾，原则上，资料本身的 扭曲不会发生在课程的中间。</td></tr><tr><td>A mistake for example in notes would not apply here.However, my dear distortive and naughty Ruburt here not only put words into my mouth, unconsciously of course, but then said sweetly that they were not distortions.</td><td>记录的错误，在这里就不适用了。然而，我亲爱的歪曲调皮的鲁伯，在这里不仅 把话塞到我的嘴里，当然是无意识地，然后还甜甜地说，这些资料都没扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>The reason is rather simple and in fact quite understandable; and the point here is that Ruburt cannot use conscious caution in these matters in any manner.I am even, and this is quite unusual for me, hesitant at bringing him to discipline here, since he is usually so concerned about subconscious distortion that I do not want to imprint the suggestion in his mind.</td><td>原因相当简单，事实上也很好理解；这里的关键是，鲁伯在这些事情上，不能以 任何方式有意识地谨慎行事。这对我来说也很不寻常，是否要让他受些纪律，我 甚至都犹豫不决，因为他通常都很在意潜意识的扭曲，我不想把这种暗示印在他 的脑海里。</td></tr><tr><td>Nevertheless the fact remains that he boo-booed, that such errors, while unavoidable at times at this stage, are most regrettable and apt to cast a slur upon the material as a whole.</td><td>尽管如此，事实仍然是，他犯错了，这类的错误虽然在现阶段，有时是不可避免 的，但却是最令人遗憾的，容易给整个资料带来污点。</td></tr><tr><td>I have mentioned a test and I will go into this in a moment, also to me the rather obvious cause of the glaring distortion.However, and I have emphasized this at times, because of our materials and methods of communication such distortions will almost of necessity occur now and then.We can only hope for their gradual disappearance, but we cannot force their disappearance.That is, you cannot.Outside of putting Ruburt in a deep trance, there is nothing that I can do along this line.And there you have it.</td><td>我提到了一个检测的方法，我马上就要谈它，也会谈谈，对我来说，造成明显失 真的相当明显的原因。然而，我有时也强调，由于我们的资料和通讯方法，这种 扭曲几乎必然时不时地会发生。我们只能希望它们逐渐消失，但我们不能强迫它 们消失。也就是说，你不能。在这方面，我也毫无办法，除非让鲁伯进入很深的 出神状态。这就是原因了。</td></tr><tr><td>For personality reasons neither of you would be happy, I'm afraid, were Ruburt to go into deep trances at my instigation during sessions.And you, Joseph, would be much less enthusiastic even than Ruburt.So we must simply work as we are and make the best of it for now.</td><td>由于人格的原因，如果鲁伯在我的怂恿下，让他在课程期间进入深深的出神状 态，我恐怕你们俩都不会高兴。而你，约瑟，甚至会比鲁伯更降低热忱。所以， 我们目前必须维持现状，尽己之力，尽量做好。</td></tr><tr><td>Generally the distortions will cease almost entirely.However, while we are working with word patterns in this manner there will unfortunately always be some, though lesser, distortions.And in the main body of the material there are very few distortions, as I have explained.Of course, at this point you cannot prove the main thesis of the important material which is not distorted.</td><td>通常，扭曲会几乎完全停止。但是，当我们是以这种方式处理文字模式时，很不 幸地，虽然是少一点，但总会有一些失真。而在资料的主体部分，如我所解释 的，失真的情况很少。那些重要的资料没有被扭曲。当然，目前你无法证明它的 主要论点。</td></tr><tr><td>You must however remember that this whole experience is new for Ruburt, and that necessary purity of perception and communication needs to develop.Now as for the cause of the glaring distortion.It is ridiculously simple.Indeed you must already know what it is.</td><td>不过你必须记住，这整个经历对鲁伯来说都是新的，必要的感知与交流的纯净度 需要发展。至于造成明显扭曲的原因。简单得可笑。事实上，你一定已经知道它 是什么了。</td></tr><tr><td>Your Ruburt saw a car, was expecting your friend, had imagined my comment, and leaped to the lightning fast conclusion, along with a rather flattering desire to prove me supposedly right in an instance that could be checked.Dear Ruburt, sometimes you are like a dumb skull if not a numbskull, and I will give my own proof in my own good time, and without such flattering but ineffectual help as this.</td><td>鲁伯看到了一辆车，同时也正等着你的朋友，想像了我的言论，于是闪电般地下 了结论，同时带有讨喜之意，想在一个可以被检验的例子中，证明我应该是对的。亲爱的鲁伯，有时候你就像一个傻头傻脑的木头，我会在我自己的好时机里，给出我自己的证明，而不需要这样迎合但徒劳的帮忙。</td></tr><tr><td>Help like this is no help indeed.</td><td>这样的帮助真的是无济于事。</td></tr><tr><td>As for the test I mentioned.If there is any doubt in the future, for one thing check the portion of the material in which the doubtful statement is made.If this occurs in the very beginning of a session or at the very end, then do not panic.I truly have never seen such panic in such an instance as I saw on your face, dear Joseph.</td><td>至于我提到的检验。如果将来有任何疑问，首先要查看的，是资料中有疑问的那 部分。如果这有疑问的部分是出现在一节课的开始或最后的地方，那就不要慌张。亲爱的约瑟，你脸上的那种惊慌失措，我真的从来没有在别处见过。</td></tr><tr><td>We are lucky, and I really mean lucky, that our distortions have been so few and so obvious.At least the obvious distortions are easily discovered.And in the main and in the long run this is much better for the material as a whole.</td><td>我们很幸运，我们真的很幸运，我们的失真是如此的少，又如此的明显。至少那 些明显的扭曲很容易被发现。而且从主要和长远的角度来看，这对整体资料来说 是非常好的。</td></tr><tr><td>Just don't be anxious, Ruburt.Also on checking wait for a few minutes, Joseph, and then ask the doubtful question again, or rephrase the statement into a question.Wait a good five minutes, but no more than fifteen minutes.</td><td>先别焦急，鲁伯。对于核对，先等几分钟，约瑟，然后再问有疑惑的问题，或者 把陈述改写成问题。好好等上五分钟，但不要超过十五分钟。</td></tr><tr><td>You should not, and I repeat this, grow panicky at the thought of distortions occurring, simply because to expect no distortions is just as unrealistic, and would send you flying headlong against an eventual wall of disillusion.We are not dealing with rigidities.Ruburt will improve.I do not want to set up a fear that is an exaggerated fear of distortions, since this might well make him so rigid that he would block perfectly valid material, fearing he was adding distortion.</td><td>你不应该，我要重复这一点，你不应该一想到会有扭曲就慌张，因为期望不发生 扭曲是不现实的，而且会让你一头撞上最终的幻灭之墙。我们面对的不是僵化的 问题。鲁伯会进步的。我不想树立起一种对扭曲的夸张的恐惧，因为这很可能使 他变得很生硬，因为害怕自己加入了扭曲而阻挡了完全可靠的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>The validity of this whole material will show clearly through whatever distortions ever arise, and the material itself will provide more and more proof for its statements as we continue.At a much later date the very type of communication will evolve into something much clearer, more vivid; and while words will always play some part, other elements will be added in the future that will actually be evidence for the material.That is, the means will also be an end.</td><td>无论出现何种扭曲，这整个资料的有效性，都将清楚地显示出来，随着我们的继 续下去，资料本身将为它的陈述，提供越来越多的证明。在很久以后，这种类型 的沟通会演变成更清晰、更生动的东西；然而文字仍会扮演某些角色，将来还会 加入其他的元素，这些元素实际上会成为资料的佐证。也就是说，这只是达到目 的的手段。</td></tr><tr><td>"This will not happen today or tomorrow.I do not want the fear of distortion to undermine Ruburt's confidence or your own, for it is the very basis of our communication.Much better to let some distortive material through than to let no material through at all. "</td><td>这种情况不会发生在今天或明天。我不想因为害怕失真而削弱鲁伯或你自己的信 心，因为信心是我们交流的基础。让一些扭曲的资料透过来，比没有任何资料进 来要好得多。</td></tr><tr><td>I realize that the distortions bother you more than they bother me.However, to be truthful I anticipated more distortions than we have been getting, and my cronies have been amazed, particularly since Ruburt is not in a deep trance.It was unfortunate that your friend did not arrive on time.It was this extra element of anticipation that kept Ruburt from the usual excellent state of dissociation in the beginning of the session.</td><td>我知道，这些扭曲，对你的困扰比对我的困扰更大。然而，说实话，我预计会出 现的扭曲，比实际发生的还要多，我的伙伴们都很惊讶，尤其是鲁伯并不是处在 很深的出神状态中。很不幸，你的朋友没有按时到达。正是"预期"这个额外的 元素，使鲁伯在课程开始时，没有进入像平时那般极佳的出神状态。</td></tr><tr><td>Had the visitor arrived on time Ruburt would have been able to handle the situation.It was the extra conscious and subconscious element of anticipation that got him into trouble.</td><td>如果访客准时到达，鲁伯就能处理好状况。正是因为这额外的意识和潜意识中的"预期"元素，让他惹上麻烦。</td></tr><tr><td>And now my two wounded pigeons, bandage yourselves up in a short period of rest.You will fly away yet.I hope these few remarks have been crumbs for your flagging confidence.But humor aside, you cannot start out without expecting some difficulties along the way, and in this most difficult area of communication particularly.Mark my words.</td><td>现在我的两只受伤的鸽子，休息片刻，把自己包扎好。你们还飞得起来。我希望 这几句话对你们的信心有所帮助。但撇开幽默不谈，你们在刚开始的时候，不能 指望一路上不会遇到一些困难，尤其是在这个最难沟通的领域。请记住我的话。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:00.Jane was dissociated as usual toward the end of the above monologue.We were both disappointed at Bill's failure to appear.For my part I tried to snap out of it by making some jokes, but Jane did not join in.She resumed dictating at 10:05. )"</td><td>(10 点休息。珍像往常一样，在上述独白快结束时，离开出神状态。我们都对比尔没有现身感到失望。我试图说些笑话来摆脱不快，但珍没有参与。她在 10:05 恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am quite certain, Joseph, that for once Ruburt does not appreciate your humorous remarks made during break.Quite innocently and oh so exuberantly he leaped upon the chance to show in the record how right I was and how wrong he was, but there you have it.</td><td>我很确定，约瑟，这一次鲁伯并不欣赏你在休息时的幽默言论。他非常天真地， 喔，且兴高采烈地抓住机会，想在记录中表明我是多么正确，而他有多么的错， 但这就是事实。</td></tr><tr><td>And incidentally, do not blame your friend for not arriving.You are not going to make him over, and he tries very hard within the limits set by his entity.And now if all the fireworks are over, may I return to the subject from which I was so uproariously interrupted.</td><td>顺便说一下，别责怪你的朋友没来。你没办法要他过来，他在他的存有设定的限 制范围内，很努力的尝试了。现在，如果所有的焰火都已散尽，请允许我回到我 被如此喧闹地打断的话题上。</td></tr><tr><td>We were discussing free will, and if I may say so Ruburt's little distortion was a beautiful example in kind.</td><td>我们刚刚正在讨论自由意志，如果我可以这么说的话，鲁伯的小扭曲，实在是这 方面的一个美妙的例子。</td></tr><tr><td>A quick review.Free will exists on a limited scale on your plane, but it does exist, and the very limitations themselves are the result of free will choices made on another plane by the various entities.</td><td>快速回顾一下。自由意志在你们的层面上，存在的规模有限，但它确实存在，而 恰恰这个限制本身，就是各种存有，在另一个层面上，经由自由意志所选择的结 果。</td></tr><tr><td>It is quite true that the inner ego is aware through the inner senses of any choices that the outer ego will make with the use of free will.This does not mean that decisions are in any way predetermined.It only means that the inner ego is not bound by the dimensions in which those free will choices are made.</td><td>很真确的是，内在自我通过内在感官可以觉知到，外在自我利用自由意志所将做 出的任何选择。这并不意味着决定是以任何方式预定的。它只表示，内在自我不 受这些自由意志选择的维度所束缚。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane and I had discussed this problem at supper time.Her explanation had sounded better than mine, and tallied closely with Seth's presentation above.We had been hoping he would discuss it during the session.)</td><td>(珍和我在晚餐时讨论了这个问题。她的解释听起来比我的好，而且与赛斯的上述 介绍非常吻合。我们一直希望他能在课程上讨论这个问题。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your clock time as you know is camouflage, and does not exist as far as the inner ego is concerned.This certainly should not be strange to you, since you know that even your present personalities can to some extent escape from clock time through the use of psychological time.I have said that there is no time without barriers.The inner ego is aware of fewer barriers and therefore is not bound by time to the degree that the outer ego is bound.</td><td>你们所知道的钟表时间是伪装的，就内在自我而言，钟表时间并不存在。这一点 你们当然不该感到奇怪，因为你们知道，即使是你们现在的人格，也可以在一定 程度上，通过利用心理时间来逃避钟表时间。我曾说过，没有障碍就没有时间。内在自我意识到较少的障碍，因此受时间束缚的程度，就不像外在自我受到的那 么大。</td></tr><tr><td>Tuesday does not exist to the inner ego.Your outer ego is now experiencing the camouflage time year of 1964.This simply does not exist to the inner ego, therefore the inner ego is effortlessly aware of any choices or decisions that you may make freely in say 1970.It does not affect your choice.It has absolutely nothing to do with whatever future choice you may make.It is aware of such future choices simply because the camouflage future does not exist for it.</td><td>星期二对内在的自我来说并不存在。你的外在自我，现在正经历着 1964 年的伪装时间年。对于内在自我而言，这根本不存在，因此内在自我毫不费力地意识到， 你可能在，例如 1970 年，自由地做出的任何选择或决定。它不会影响你的选择。它与你将来可能做出的任何选择，完全无关。它之所以觉知这未来的选择，仅仅是因为，伪装的未来，对它来说，不存在。</td></tr><tr><td>This should become plain as you study it.</td><td>这会随着你的学习而变得清楚。</td></tr><tr><td>Theoretically an animal has free choice, and this will do very well as an example of what I mean by limitations.An animal is free enough to travel to, say, California from New York.There is nothing in his physical makeup to prevent the physical journey, but the point, if you'll excuse the pun, is pointless.Even a pointer would have difficulty.The dog's legs could easily make the trip with planned or unplanned rests, but the animal is simply not aware that such a place or destination exists to begin with.</td><td>理论上动物是有自由选择的，这会是个很好的例子，来说明我所说的局限性。动物有足够的自由，可以从纽约前往，比如说，加利福尼亚。牠的身体构造中，没有任何东西可以阻止这种身体的旅程，但是，有一点[point]，如果你能原谅这个 双关语，这是毫无意义的[pointless]。即使是一只猎犬[pointer]也会有困难。狗的四 肢可以很容易地随着计划内、或计划外的休息进行旅行，但打从一开始，动物就根本不知道有这样一个地方或目的地的存在。</td></tr><tr><td>Nor could he purposely set out for such a journey as a rule.Animals, many times using their own inner senses, have made such journeys, but their conscious apparatus alone would not permit it.In like manner such choice possibilities exist for human personalities, but to all intents and purposes they do not exist because the personality is too limited to take advantage of them.</td><td>通常，牠也不可能特意去做这样的旅行。动物们，很多时候利用自己的内在感 官，进行过这样的旅行，但仅凭牠们有意识的器官是做不到的。同样，这种选择 的可能性也存在于人类的人格中，但就所有意图和目的而言，它们可以说并不存 在，因为人格太受限，无法利用它们。</td></tr><tr><td>Many limitations are set upon personalities by their own entities for karmic reasons.I want to make it plain that free will does exist, but that it is limited through use of a more extended free will on the part of the entity.Also, the inner ego is aware of so-called future decisions not because he forces such decisions upon the outer ego but simply because the future as such does not exist to the inner ego, and therefore he can perceive where the outer ego cannot.</td><td>许多限制是由他们自己的存有，出于业的理由，而设定在人格上的。我想说明白 的是，自由意志确实存在，但它是通过存有方面，使用更广泛的自由意志来限制 的。此外，内在自我知道所谓的未来决策，不是因为它把这样的决定强加给外在 自我，而只是因为，这样的未来，对内在自我来说是不存在的，因此他能感知到 外在自我所不能感知到的。</td></tr><tr><td>Although someone begins reading this material on page one, for example, this does not mean that page four hundred does not already exist.Your outer ego is forced into what could be called successive action, but the inner ego is not so bound.This should make the point more clear.I mentioned earlier that cause and effect operates in various manners, and what seems to be cause and effect is often merely a result of your necessary disposition to view actions in a successive manner.</td><td>比如说，虽然有人从第一页开始阅读这些资料，但这并不意味着第四百页尚未存 在。你的外在自我被迫进入可称为连续的行动中，但内在自我却没有这样的束 缚。这应该能让这一点更加清楚了。我在前面提到，因与果以各种方式运作，看 似因果的事情，往往只是你以相续的方式看待行动，而产生的必须处置的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>Because you are forced at this point to perceive actions in a separate and successive fashion you more or less naturally take it for granted that one thing causes another, or that one action could not occur before another that appears to follow it.This is of course not the case, although it is an example of the distortions you get when you rely upon the outer senses only.</td><td>因为你此时被迫以一种个别的、连续的方式来感知行动，你多少会理所当然地认 为，一件事引起另一件事，或者说，本该随着事件之后才发生的行动，不可能发 生在事件之前。当然事实并非如此，这只是一个例子，说明当你只依赖外在感官 时，才会有扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break, as I have a feeling that you are already past the breaking point.</td><td>我建议休息一下，因为我感觉你们已经过了休息点。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:34.Jane was dissociated this time as usual.She resumed dictating at 10:41. )</td><td>(10:34 休息。珍解离如常，10:41恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>Before I get back into the material I have been trying to give you all night, I do have a few other

he knew that your friend would not arrive on time, and this disturbed him to some degree.  "</td><td>比如鲁伯肩膀的疼痛，就是紧张的迹象，虽然意识上他不以为意，但潜意识里， 他知道你们的朋友不会按时到达，这多少让他感到不安。</td></tr><tr><td>The ache was the physical and nervous construction of his subconscious irritation.I would like to make another note, and I believe I may have mentioned this.I know Ruburt at one time or another was aware of it.I have nothing against Ruburt's reading of the material of course.I strongly suggest, however, that he does not in the future read the material on the night of a session.It only makes him apprehensive and nervous.</td><td>疼痛是他潜意识里的恼怒在肉体和神经上的建构。我想再做个说明，我想我可能 提过这一点。我知道鲁伯曾一度意识到这一点。我当然不反对鲁伯读这份资料。但是，我强烈建议他今后不要在课程当晚读资料。这只会让他担心和紧张。</td></tr><tr><td>Patting myself on the back, I may elaborate.The complexity of the material sends him for a loop.He studies it, worries about keeping up what he sometimes thinks of his fine performance, and could end up by ruining mine.</td><td>拍拍我自己的背，我或许会详细说明一下。资料的复杂性让他大为震惊。他研究 它，担心着要维持他有时认为的优良表现，却最终破坏了我的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>This also aggravated the ache in his shoulder.The help I need from you, Ruburt, is on another level entirely.I do not want you to become overly involved with the material, which is why it has worked out so that Joseph does the recording.</td><td>这也加重了他肩膀的疼痛。鲁伯，我需要你帮忙的，完全是在另一个层次上。我 不想让你过度涉入这份资料，这就是为什么让约瑟负责记录的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not mean that Ruburt should not read the material, but he should not read it immediately before a session.It overawes him.I do use much of his subconscious knowledge.I do draw upon the knowledge of his own inner ego.He is helping me very much as it is, but please, Ruburt, do not meddle.Tonight with your overhasty pronouncements on my part you meddled, however innocently.</td><td>我的意思不是说鲁伯不该读这份资料，但他不该在课即将开始前去读它。这会吓 了他。我确实用了很多他潜意识的知识。我确实从他自己的内在自我汲取了知 识。他就是这样地帮了我很多忙，但是，鲁伯，请不要插手。今晚，你对我的部 分的草率宣布，你干预了，尽管是无辜的。</td></tr><tr><td>Your intellect is a good one but we need more than your intellect in these sessions.You become intellectually involved when you read the material directly before sessions, and it could hamper the session itself.I leave your intellectual writing life alone, though you are free to use what you have learned, so kindly keep your sometimes meddling intellect out of the sessions themselves.Your intellect is a good one, again, but darling it is no match for mine.</td><td>你的智力很好，但我们的课，需要的不仅仅是你的智力。当你在课即将开始前读 这些资料，你会成为理智地参与，这可能会妨碍到课程本身。我不干涉你的智性 写作生涯，你尽管自由地使用你所学到的东西，所以请把你有时管闲事的聪明用 在课程之外。再说一次，你的智力很棒，但亲爱的，和我的无法相比。</td></tr><tr><td>Your intuitions, believe it or not, are almost a match for mine.When you are on my plane you'll probably set earth's skies thundering.You can pursue the material intellectually if you choose at other times; but not, please, just before a session, and please give your intuitions freedom during sessions.</td><td>你的直觉，不管你信不信，几乎可以和我的相提并论。当你在我的层面上时，你 可能会让地球的天空雷声大作。如果你选别的时间，你可以理智地追求这份资料；但请不要，在即将上课之前，请在课程中让你的直觉自由挥洒。</td></tr><tr><td>You use abilities, and so does Joseph, that cannot be used effectively at this present stage simultaneously with outer egotistical intellectual judgments.I am just saying, don't try to use both at once during sessions.And that was a mouthful.</td><td>你利用你的才能，约瑟也一样，但在现阶段，若同时使用外在自我本位的理智判 断，就无法有效地运用这些才能。我只是说，不要试图在课程期间同时使用两种 能力。而这是很有道理的。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, both of you have particularly strongly-developed latent abilities as far as the inner senses are concerned.Otherwise these sessions would not be possible.It is true that at the present time your abilities vary in direction, yet they complement each other in action and therefore in result.</td><td>就内在感官而言，你们两个都有特别强力发展出来的潜在能力。否则，将不可能 有这些课程。的确，目前你们的能力在方向上有所不同，但在行动上是互补，因 此结果也是相辅相成的。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt uses dissociation in order to free his abilities so that they may be used more effectively.The telepathy occurrence with your witness is an example.However it is also true that this opening allows me entry.Joseph, you will find that your experiences with the inner senses occur often at split moments of dissociation.</td><td>鲁伯利用解离来释放他的能力，以便更有效地使用这些能力。与你们的证人发生 的心灵感应就是一个例子。然而这个开口让我进入，这也是事实。约瑟，你会发 现，你内在感官的经验往往发生在霎时间解离的那个片刻。</td></tr><tr><td>I had intended this evening to go into our third inner sense and instead ended up with other materials.We still have very much on the inner senses to cover.Not only will they be named but you will be given exercises in their separate use.Again, this is difficult, because for me they operate in a more coordinated and organized pattern.</td><td>我本来打算今晚要讲到我们的第三内在感官，结果却讲了其他的资料。我们在内 在感官上，还有非常多的内容要讲。不仅它们要被命名，而且你们还要分别地对 它们进行练习。再说一次，这很难，因为对我来说，它们是以一种更协调、更有 组织的模式运作的。</td></tr><tr><td>I now suggest your regular break.</td><td>我现在建议照例休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:05.Jane was dissociated as usual.The ache in her shoulder had let up somewhat, but she was not too surprised now to develop a pain in a foot.During break she hopped about until it too eased up.Discussing distortions during break, we recalled that once or twice Seth had mentioned using the deep trance state.Neither of us cared much for the idea.Jane resumed at 11:12.)</td><td>(11:05 休息。珍解离如常。她的肩痛已稍微缓解，但她现在对脚上出现了疼痛并不太讶异。休息时，她跳来跳去，直到脚痛也缓解了。休息时讨论到扭曲，我们想起有一两次，赛斯提到利用深度出神状态。我们俩都不太喜欢这个想法。11:12 分，珍恢复传述。)</td></tr><tr><td>In a deep trance there is always a certain lack of protection involved.Many on my plane do teach, or try to teach, using such a fashion.It is one of my personal peculiarities that I do not approve of this educational device.</td><td>在深度的出神状态中，总是少了某种保护。在我的层面上，许多人确实用这种方 式教学，或试图用这种方式教学。我个人的怪癖之一就是，我并不赞同这种教育 手段。</td></tr><tr><td>Benefits received by personalities who are in deep trance are not nearly as long-lasting as they are in my method.It is true that in the trance state the subconscious learns.However, the subconscious knowledge eventually must be transferred to the personality-consciousness.In other methods than my own this transference takes place at a later time, usually on a midplane after the death of the personality on your plane.</td><td>处于深度出神状态的人格所得到的好处，远不如我的方法来得持久。的确，在出 神状态下，潜意识是可以学习。然而，潜意识的知识最终必须转移到人格-意识中。用我的方法以外的其他方法，这种转移会发生的较迟，通常是在你们层面上 的人格死亡后的中间层面上。</td></tr><tr><td>I prefer the method we are using, in that assimilation takes place more directly and immediately, and the personality involved makes an active contribution.</td><td>我更喜欢我们现在用的方法，因为转化发生得更直接和迅速，涉入的人格也可积 极地做出贡献。</td></tr><tr><td>("What do others on your plane think of your method?")</td><td>("你层面上的其他人对你的方法有什么看法？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Others are watching.There is some friendly disagreement; we are all here what you would call educators, and I sometimes fear that we become too concerned with methods.I much prefer personally an active, fairly alert personality student rather than a deep trance subject who passively receives and transmits spoon-fed knowledge.I thrive on flexible give and take.Ruburt is dissociated but all the connections are left open.</td><td>其他人都在留神观察。有一些友善的分歧；我们都是你们所说的教育者，有时我 担心，我们会过于关注方法。我个人更偏爱活跃，又相当警觉的学生，而不是一 个深度出神的主体，被动而填鸭式地接收和传递知识。灵活的给出和接收让我特 别来劲。鲁伯是在出神状态，但所有的连结仍保持开放。</td></tr><tr><td>With deep trance the conscious outer state is completely switched off.Knowledge is forcibly poured down the imaginary gullet, and I can't feel very enthusiastic over such a method.What we are doing may be slower on your terms, but the effects are more durable and the whole self is aware of any knowledge thus received.</td><td>深度出神时，意识的外在状态是完全关闭的。知识被强行灌入想像的食道中，我 对这种方法不太热衷。我们所做的，以你们的话来说，可能比较慢，但是效果比 较持久，而且整体自己知晓由此接收到的任何知识。</td></tr><tr><td>"There are other methods also, but they are lesser in importance and not relied upon generally.Someday we will have to have some tests, and for my pride among my associates I hope you come through.My method does involve the strong possibility of some distortions and the active cooperation of my students, but this presents a challenge to me rather than a detriment.I imagine that I myself will be the brunt of a few jokes because of tonight's little misfortune. "</td><td>也有其他的方法，但重要性较低，也比较不可靠。总有一天我们要进行一些测 试，为了在我的伙伴中有面子，我希望你们能过关。我的方法确实极有可能出现 一些失真，也需要学生的积极配合，但这对我来说是一种挑战，而不是坏处。我 想，因为今晚的小小不幸，我可能会成为笑柄。</td></tr><tr><td>("Well, there aren't many on this plane who go into such a deep trance state, are there?")</td><td>("🗎，在这个层面上，进入这么深的出神状态的人并不多，是吗？")。</td></tr><tr><td>There are many more than you would suppose.The trouble here is that the personality has little protection, and is open to fragments that may enter if the educator on my plane does not scrupulously keep guard.I do not approve of this except for certain particular purposes.</td><td>比你认为的要多得多。问题是，人格没有什么保护，如果我的层面上的教育者不 严加防范，就会有片段进入。除了某些特殊的目的，我不赞成这样做。</td></tr><tr><td>Also, I do not agree that it is beneficial for the personality to become used to dispensing so entirely with his camouflage pattern.It is necessary that the camouflage pattern be recognized for what it is, but on your plane it still must be manipulated, and the efficiency of manipulation is extremely necessary.</td><td>另外，我也不认同，让人格习惯于完全丢掉他的伪装模式是有益的。辨识出伪装 模式只是伪装，是有必要的，但在你们层面上，它仍然必须被操控，而操控的效 率也是极其必要的。</td></tr><tr><td>The temporary and apparent sense of freedom from the camouflage pattern often times leads the subject or student into a false sense of freedom from it in daily life, and causes a lack of ego discipline that should be maintained.Our method does not involve such dangerous territory.</td><td>来自于伪装模式的暂时且表面的自由感，往往会使主体或学生在日常生活中，产 生一种虚假的自由感，这造成本该维持住的自我约束的欠缺。我们的方法不涉及 这样的危险领域。</td></tr><tr><td>I will close the session unless you have further questions.</td><td>除非你还有问题，否则我将结束这节课。</td></tr><tr><td>("I'm wondering who all these people are who go into these deep trance states.Do we know any of them?")</td><td>("我想知道这些进入深层出神状态的人都是谁。我们认识他们中的任何人吗？)</td></tr><tr><td>No, not as far as my knowledge is concerned.</td><td>据我所知，没有。</td></tr><tr><td>("They wouldn't be entering such states in sleep, would they?")</td><td>("他们不会在睡眠中进入这样的状态吧？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Not the sort of thing to which I am referring.I will go into this at a later date.I prefer to give you more data on the other inner senses first, since it will make the rest so much clearer.</td><td>我指的不是这类事情。我以后再谈这个问题。我比较喜欢先给你们更多其他内在 感官的资料，因为它会使其余部分更加清晰。</td></tr><tr><td>Before we close I want to mention the importance of the third inner sense with the experience of concept patterns.The third inner sense, involving what you would call perception of past, present and future, is the sense that enables the inner ego and entities to experience direct concept-patterns, and free them therefore from successive cause and effect limitations.</td><td>在我们结束之前，我想提及第三种内在感官对概念模式经验的重要性。第三种内 在感官，涉及你们所说的对过去、现在和未来的感知，是让内在自我和存有们能 够经历直接的概念模式的感官，并因此使它们摆脱连续的因果限制。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you either take a break or close the session, as you prefer.</td><td>我建议休息一下或结束课程，随你意。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:36.Jane was dissociated as usual.She said Seth had been trying to get the above paragraph in all evening.Jane was obviously tired now, so I told Seth we'd hear from him next Monday as usual.Jane resumed at 11:37. )</td><td>(11:36 休息。珍解离如常。她说赛斯整晚都在试着把上面那段话传过来。珍现在显然是累了，所以我告诉赛斯，下周一照常上课。珍在 11:37 恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>You have no idea of the temptation on my part to cram you as full as I possibly can, and this is the temptation to which my enthusiastic colleagues often fall prey.Especially when they leave their student powerless to resist, though this is somewhat of an exaggeration.In any case bear up, you two grumbly bears.I wish you both, even Ruburt, a fond, merry and undistorted good evening.</td><td>你不知道在我这一方，我多么想尽可能多地把资料塞给你们，这也是我热情的同 事们经常陷入的诱惑。特别是当他们让自己的学生无力抵抗时，虽然这么说有点 夸张。无论如何要挺住(bear up)，你们这两只发牢骚的熊(bear)。我祝你们俩，甚至鲁伯，有一个美好的、快乐的、不受干扰的夜晚。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.

very difficult for you to conceive of large concepts to begin with.You are forced to think using word symbols strung one before the other, and therefore you are imprisoned by a camouflage of continuity.</td><td>在你的钟表时间里，你很难一开始就设想一个庞大的概念。你被迫使用一个个串 联起来的文字符号来思考，因此你被连续性的伪装所禁锢。</td></tr><tr><td>You find difficulty in escaping from time, as a rule, and therefore you are also imprisoned by past, present and future, in such a way that they appear to be walls which never can be climbed.Not only is it difficult for you to conceive of a large concept for these reasons, but also it is well nigh impossible to communicate such a concept to you.</td><td>通常，你们很难摆脱时间的束缚，因此你们也被过去、现在和未来所禁锢，它们 似乎是永远无法攀登的墙桓。由于这些原因，你们不仅难以构思一个大的概念， 而且这样的概念似乎也不可能传达给你们。</td></tr><tr><td>You insist upon a continuity and a seeming cause and effect because of the erected wall barrier that you yourselves have constructed.Concepts such as those I am referring to reach beyond your ideas of time and space.</td><td>由于你们自己建造了一堵墙的障碍，你们坚持一种连续性和貌似因果的关系。我 所指的这些概念，超越了你们的时间和空间观念。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now John had finished his chart in the studio.While Jane continued to pace about the room, dictating in her clear strong voice, John entered, poured himself a glass of wine and lit a cigarette.I pointed to a pad and pen I had laid out in case he wanted to take his own notes.But John shook his head and settled down on the couch.Jane continued without a break.)</td><td>(现在，约翰已经在工作室里完成了他的图表。当珍继续在房间里踱步，用她那清 晰有力的声音传述时，约翰进来了，给自己倒了一杯酒，点了一支烟。我指了指我摆放的笔记本和笔，如果他想自己做笔记。但约翰摇了摇头，在沙发上坐了下来。珍继续说着，没有中断。)</td></tr><tr><td>When and if you become proficient in the use of the third inner sense, then and only then will you be able to receive such concepts.When cognition is more or less spontaneous, then you can appreciate a concept on its own terms.</td><td>当你们且唯有当你们熟练了第三种内在感官的运用时，那么，只有到那时，你才 能够接收到这样的概念。当认知能力多少是自发的时候，你们才能够体会概念本 身的真正意涵。</td></tr><tr><td>When cognition is spontaneous or nearly so, then the idea can have freedom.You are bounded by your cause and effect theories.You believe in your ideas of time, and depend upon them to such a degree that it is impossible at this stage for you to conceive of a concept that has nothing to do with space or time.</td><td>当认知是自发的，或近乎自发的时候，那么观念就有了自由。你受制于你的因果 理论。你相信你的时间观念，并依赖它们，以至于在这个阶段，你不可能设想出 一个与空间或时间无关的概念。</td></tr><tr><td>As an analogy, you live in a self-constructed box with certain self- constructed senses to enable you to perceive the box world that you yourself have created.Any true concept has its origins outside your box, and continues beyond it.</td><td>打个比方，你生活在一个自己建构的盒子里，有某些自我建构的感官，使你能够 感知你自己创造的盒子世界。任何真正的概念都是起源于你的盒子之外，并在盒 子外继续延展。</td></tr><tr><td>(During this session, Jane spoke with much emphasis.I have underlined a few words and phrases she seemed to pay special attention to.Seth began this session in a very positive manner, as though he would be all business this time, and kept at it hammer and tongs.)</td><td>(在本节课中，珍以非常强调的语气说着。我在她似乎特别注意的几个词句下划了 底线。赛斯以一种非常积极的态度开始这节课，好像他这次要专心致志，并全力以赴。)</td></tr><tr><td>It also riddles your box through.Nevertheless, with your camouflage senses you perceive only that part of the concept that happens to fall within your box, and even then you receive and interpret such a concept with your outer senses, and therefore distort it out of all recognition.</td><td>概念仍会过筛而经过你的盒子。然而，用你的伪装感官，你只感知到恰好落在你 的盒子内的那部分概念，即使这样，你也还是用你的外在感官来接收和诠释这样 的概念，因此把它扭曲得面目全非。</td></tr><tr><td>Unless you use the inner senses in the manner that I have and will prescribe, you will always receive but a glimmering of any true concept, regardless of its simplicity.</td><td>除非你用我已经和将要订定的方式运用内在感官，否则，你将永远只会收到任何 真实概念的微光一现，无论这概念是多么简单。</td></tr><tr><td>The third inner sense, as I have told you, will enable you to some extent to free yourselves from the constructions of past, present and future, and will permit in theory instant cognition.As far as practice is concerned you will never achieve such instant cognition, but you will be able to set aside now and then the boundaries of time, and you will be able at least to glimmer the reality and the concepts of which I speak.</td><td>第三种内在感官，如我告诉过你的，将使你们在某种程度上从过去、现在和未来 的结构中解脱出来，并将在理论上允许瞬间的认知。就实际的实践而言，你们永 远不会达到这样的瞬间认知，但你们将能够偶尔抛开时间的界限，你们至少可以 瞥见我所说的实相和概念。</td></tr><tr><td>I am afraid I am a poor sort of host, and not much given to the niceties, or at least your

such awareness would not be possible at all, and certainly this is something you will have to work at.It is not instantaneous by any means.</td><td>这是很合理的，但若非在这些课程中已经成就的纪律和自由的奇怪结合，这样的 觉察根本不可能，当然这也是你必须努力的事情。这绝不是一蹴而就的。</td></tr><tr><td>("We wondered about that.We also rather thought two participants were necessary to get good results with the cards.")</td><td>("我们想过这事。我们还认为，必须有两个参与者玩牌，效果才好。")。</td></tr><tr><td>For purposes of sending records to Duke you may be best covered by using two, an operator and a subject.But for your own, or our own purposes, one is sufficient.I do suggest however that you both also work with the cards.</td><td>为了把记录送到杜克大学，你最好用两个人，一个操作者和一个对象。但对于你 们自己，或我们自己的目的，一个人就够了。不过我建议你们两个人也用卡片实 验。</td></tr><tr><td>I want to go into the inner senses further but suggest that you take your first break.</td><td>我想进一步探讨内在感官，不过，建议你们先来个第一次的休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27.Jane was only moderately dissociated.She still felt tired, she said, but at least no worse.When she began dictating again her voice was a little louder.She kept up her rather fast pacing.Resume at 9:31. )</td><td>(9:27 休息。珍适度地解离。她说，她还是觉得很累，但至少没有更糟。当她再次开始传述时，她的声音大了一些。她踱步速度仍然很快。9:31 继续)。</td></tr><tr><td>I may make this a short session, since Ruburt is somewhat indisposed, and after all I am not that much of a taskmaster.But if I do make it a brief session, then I will have you exercise your abilities with the ESP cards until the ordinary ending of the session.So you will not get off scot-free.</td><td>由于鲁伯有些不舒服，我也许会把这节课缩短一点，毕竟我不是个苛刻的工头。但如果我真的把课缩短，那么我要让你们用 ESP 卡来训练你们的能力，直到正常课结束的时间。所以你们不会逍遥课外。</td></tr><tr><td>As far as the inner senses are concerned, they merge smoothly, one into the other, operating as a unit in what I will call pure unhampered circumstances.They work that way for me, for example, yet I must attempt to list them separately for you.</td><td>就内在感官而言，它们流畅地融合在一起，一个融入另一个，以一个我称之为纯 然无阻碍的情况，作为一个单位运作着。比如对我来说，它们就是这样运作的， 然而为了你们，我必须试着把它们分别列出来。</td></tr><tr><td>There are difficulties also.Not so much in interpretation as the fact that some terms may be negatively suggestive, or that you may put emotional connotations where they do not belong.</td><td>困难还是有的。并不是在解释方面，而是有些术语可能具有负面的暗示，或者你 可能把情感的内涵放在不属于它们的地方。</td></tr><tr><td>For example as I have said, the fourth or conceptual sense ignores what you call past, present and future, and so can appreciate a concept in its entirety, can actually experience the concept in much the same manner that you might work out an idea through a drama, if you follow me.</td><td>比如我说过，第四种或概念性感官无视你所谓的过去、现在和未来，所以可以整 体性地领会一个概念，可以实际体验这个概念，就像你可能透过一出戏而想通一 个想法一样，如果你能听懂的话。</td></tr><tr><td>Only in this case the dramatization provides its own actors.</td><td>只是在这种情况下，戏剧有自己的演员。</td></tr><tr><td>I am going to leave further discussion of this sense until some later session, when after additional material you will be able to understand it more thoroughly.And again remember that these senses, these inner senses, operate as a whole, and that at least to some degree the divisions between them are somewhat arbitrary on my part, and are made for the sake of simplicity.</td><td>我打算把对这种感官的进一步讨论留到以后的某节课，在增加了补充的资料后， 你们就能更彻底地理解它。再强调一次，要记得，这些感官，这些内在感官，是 作为一个整体在运作，在某种程度上，它们之间的划分，是我为了简单起见而随 意定下的。</td></tr><tr><td>The fifth inner sense carries us further along in this direction, and involves what I will call cognition of the knowledgeable essence.This sense differs from the fourth inner sense in that it does not involve the cognition of a concept.</td><td>第五种内在感官使我们在这个方向上走得更远，它涉及到我所说的对可认知的本 质之认知。这种感官不同于第四种内在感官，因为它不涉及对概念的认知。</td></tr><tr><td>It is similar to the fourth sense in that it is free of course from the arbitrary past, present and future, and it is also similar in that it involves an intimate becoming, or a transformation of self into something else.</td><td>它与第四感官相似，因为它当然不受任意的过去、现在和未来的限制，它的相似 处还在于，它涉及到自己的一种深刻的成为，或转变为其他的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>In this case it would involve living tissue.The analogy is difficult on your terms.With your outer senses now, you attempt to understand a relative or a friend.Use of this fifth inner sense, were it available to you, and in its fuller sense -fortunately it is notâwould enable you to enter into your friend.</td><td>在这种情况下，会涉及到活组织。这很难用你们的话做比喻。你现在用你的外在 感官，试图去了解一个亲戚或朋友。运用第五种内在感官，如果可供你运用的 话，并且是全面完整的运用它——幸运的是，它不是——将使你能够进入你的朋友。</td></tr><tr><td>Now this certainly sounds not only unbelievable from your point of view, but probably undesirable, and if so I appreciate and understand your reactions.However, I certainly cannot let possible unfavorable reactions on your part govern what material I give you.</td><td>现在，从你的角度来看，这当然不仅听起来不可思议，而且很可能是不可取的， 如果是这样，我很明白并理解你的反应。但是，我当然不能让你可能的不利反应 来左右我给你的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>This inner sense is not only an important one but is immensely beneficial, and is not misused in any way by those able to use it.Very simply, these senses do not function until they can be handled correctly.This sense in no way involves invasion.It does not imply that one entity can control another.It merely involves direct, instantaneous cognition of the essence of living tissue.</td><td>这个内在感官不仅是一个重要的感官，而且是大有裨益的，它不会被能够使用它 的人以任何方式滥用。非常简单，这些感官在能够正确处理之前是不会发挥作用的。这种感官绝不涉及侵入。它并不意味着一个存有可以控制另一个存有。它只 涉及到对活组织的本质 the essence of living tissue 之瞬间直接认知。</td></tr><tr><td>I use the word tissue with some caution.Nevertheless all entities, except for a few important exceptions, are in one way or another enclosed within themselves, and also connected to others by some sort of capsule, and your word tissue would seem to be the closest I can come to this.</td><td>我小心翼翼地使用组织 tissue 这一词。然而，除了几个重要的例外之外，所有存有都以某种方式围封在自己的内部，并通过某种膜囊与其他存有相连，而你们的" 组织"一词，似乎是我能想到的最接近的字。</td></tr><tr><td>This fifth sense, then, would enable you some freedom to cross this living tissue boundary into other living territory.Do not think of this living tissue necessarily as flesh, since those who are capable of using this sense fully are not on your plane to begin with.</td><td>那么，这个第五感官，使得你有一些自由，可以越过这个活组织的界限，进入其 他活的领域。不要认为这个活组织一定是肉体，因为那些有能力充分使用这种感 官的人，一开始就不在你们的层面上。</td></tr><tr><td>(The rather peculiar use of the word enable in the above paragraph is evidently just the word Seth wanted to use.I asked Jane to repeat it, to make sure I had it right the first time, and she very definitely pronounced that word.)</td><td>(上文中"enable 使得"一词的使用相当奇特，显然是赛思想用的词。我请珍重复一遍，以确保我原先听到的是正确的，她非常肯定地念出了这个词。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now this sense, like all other inner senses, is being used by the inner self-conscious ego, but the outer ego is not permitted awareness along these lines.A minimum amount of information from these inner senses is given to the outer ego after it is sifted through the subconscious.But only a minimum amount.</td><td>这个感官，就像所有其他的内在感官一样，一直被内在自觉的自我所使用，但外 在自我对于这方面的觉察是不被允许的。来自这些内在感官的最小量的信息，在 经过潜意识过筛后，被给予了外在自我。但只是最小量的信息。</td></tr><tr><td>Without any use of this fifth inner sense no man would even come close to understanding another.This is an extremely important point, and perhaps your phrase "to put yourself in someone else's place," most clearly approximates this sense.</td><td>如果不使用这第五种内在感官，没有人能理解另一个人。这是极其重要的一点， 也许你们的那句"设身处地，把自己放在对方的位置" ，是最逼真地近似于这个感官。</td></tr><tr><td>Direct experience in these inner senses will give you a much clearer picture of them than any words, even mine, can do.You understand however that any direct experience will be of very low power.I don't want to blast you off your feet.</td><td>这些内在感官的直接经验，会给你一个比任何语言，甚至是我的语言都要清晰得 多的画面。但是你要明白，任何直接的经验，力量都非常低。我不想把你轰得晕 头转向。</td></tr><tr><td>Again I suggest a brief break.</td><td>我建议再次休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:01.Jane said she was more dissociated this time.She also felt better.However I had to ask her to repeat several phrases, and thought she was tired.I felt somewhat that way also; indeed, we have often wondered whether I too am in a light trance while Seth is around.At times I have been aware of a feeling very similar to the pleasant, easygoing state I first became acquainted with when Jane hypnotized me.</td><td>(10:01 休息。珍说她这次比较出离。她也感觉好多了。我认为她累了，但我不得不让她重复几个短句。我也有些这样的感觉；事实上，我们常常在想，当赛斯在 身边时，我是否也处于轻度恍惚之中。有时，我觉察到一种感觉，非常类似于珍 对我进行催眠时，我第一次熟悉的那种愉快、轻松的状态。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane picked up her fast pace again, and began dictation in a firm, precise voice.Resume at 10:06. )</td><td>(珍又回到了快速地脚步，用坚定而准确的声音开始传述。10:06 恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>Molecular construction is formed from the inside, and is not rigid.On your plane such construction and such electronic and atomic patterns, frameworks and fields, are rigid to a degree, but even on your plane there is constant and apparent change.The pattern on your plane is more or less rigid while you exist on your plane.Nevertheless, the atoms and molecules within that pattern are far from rigid, though the pattern remains more or less the same.It is your habit, or the habit of your scientists, to carry apparent universal laws over into areas in which they do not apply.</td><td>分子构造是由内而外形成的，并不是死板的。在你们的层面上，这样的构造和这 样的电子和原子模式、架构和场域，在一定程度上是僵化的，但即使在你们的层 面上，也是有持续和明显的变化。当你存在于你的层面上时，你层面上的模式或 多或少是僵化的。尽管如此，该模式内的原子和分子远非僵化，尽管模式多少保 持不变。你们的习惯，或者你们的科学家的习惯，就是把明显的普遍规律，带入 它们不适用的领域。</td></tr><tr><td>In actuality molecular structures and patterns are not rigid.They merely appear so from your viewpoint.Nor are they imposed from without.Vitality gives itself a shape and form.The form does not impose itself upon the vitality.Therefore it is not strange to consider the possibility of changing form at will, and this is exactly what happens basically in the universe.</td><td>实际上分子的结构和模式并不僵化。它们只是从你们的角度看是如此。它们也不 是从外面强加的。生命力给自己一个形状和形式。形式并不强加给生命力。因 此，考虑随意改变形式的可能性并不奇怪，这正是宇宙中基本上在发生的事情。</td></tr><tr><td>To some extent, and to a much larger extent than you realize, this happens on your own plane, only in this case it is the subconscious will that does the actual transforming.</td><td>在某种程度上，而且是比你意识到的要大得多的程度，这发生在你们自己的层 面，只是在这种情况下，是潜意识的意志在进行实际的转化。</td></tr><tr><td>("Like the time Jane and I created those images at York Beach?")</td><td>("就像我和珍在约克海滩创造的那些影像？")。</td></tr><tr><td>In a much more simple manner, however.You make your own camouflage universe as I have told you.The growth of a disability, say the appearance of an ulcer, is the introduction of another camouflage reality to the physical body.Something that was not there suddenly is there, and in your physical universe.</td><td>然而是以更简略的方式。我告诉过你，你们创建自己的伪装宇宙。残疾的生长， 比如说溃疡的出现，就是将另一种伪装实相引入到物质身体中。原本不存在的东 西突然出现了，而且是在你们的物质宇宙中。</td></tr><tr><td>And while this may be a poor analogy, the ulcer represents a creation of something new to the physical structure.</td><td>虽然这可能是一个不好的比喻，但溃疡代表着物质结构中新事物的产生。</td></tr><tr><td>It is formed by the unconscious will for reasons of its own.It is a variation on the original pattern.I intend to tie this in for you later with a clearer explanation as to how you on your plane form your own camouflage universe, and to elucidate on the fact that form is not rigid, though it appears to be in many cases on your own plane.</td><td>它是由无意识的意志因自身的原因而形成的。它是原始模式的一种变异。我打算 稍后用更清晰的解释为你联系起来，说明你在你的层面上，如何形成你自己的伪 装宇宙，并阐明形式不是僵硬的，虽然在你自己的层面上，很多情况下似乎是如 此。</td></tr><tr><td>I want to show you how form can be changed, even on your own plane, and give you clear examples here so that you will see how in the inner reality universe, vitality can and does change its form at will.This may sound difficult but I hope that it will be plain when I am done.</td><td>我想告诉你形式，如何可以被改变，甚至在你自己的层面上也是如此，也会给你 举出清楚的例子，好让你们知道在内在实相的宇宙中，生命力可以，而且确实可 以随意改变它的形式。这听起来也许很难，但我希望说明之后就清楚了。</td></tr><tr><td>I am mentioning this material in the same session with the fifth inner sense so that you will finally understand that use of the fifth inner sense is not actually as strange as you may have thought it to be.</td><td>我在谈第五内在感官的同一节课中提到这份资料，是为了让你们最终明白，第五 内在感官的使用，其实并不像你们想像的那样奇怪。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I suggest a break.Believe it or not, I actually look forward to your spring and summer, and while traffic may bother you in the summer, I will find the air from the open windows most enjoyable.</td><td>现在我建议休息一下。不管你信不信，其实我很期待你们的春夏，虽然夏天的交 通可能会打扰到你，但我很享受从敞开的窗户飘进来的空气。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:27.Jane was dissociated as usual.She said that she now felt much better but that it was up to her, she could end the session whenever she wanted to.Seth's reference to open windows came because Jane had opened a window during last break when the room got stuffy from cigarette smoke.Resume at 10:35. )</td><td>(10:27 休息。珍解离如常。她说她现在感觉好多了，她可以随时结束这节课，由她决定。赛斯提到打开窗户，是因为珍在上次休息时，打开了一扇窗，当时房间 里的烟气很闷。10:35 恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>Now again, understand that I am breaking down an extremely complex concept into piecemeal data.There are again extremely subtle differences at times between these inner senses, although at either end of the scale there is great distinction.</td><td>再次的，要明白，我是把一个极其复杂的概念，拆解成零碎的资料。这些内在感 官之间，有时又有极其细微的差别，虽然在尺度的两端有很大的区别。</td></tr><tr><td>To complete our skeleton outline, and we will go much more deeply into all of the inner senses, I will give you some data on the sixth inner sense, which actually involves a knowledge or ability used by some of the

the possibility of other inner senses.Although it is one of the most necessary senses, I could not give it to you first since you would not have understood it.</td><td>就内在感官而言，它是一种极为基本和原始的感官，在它之内，包含了其他内在 感官的可能性。虽然它是最必要的感官之一，但我不能先介绍给你们，因为你们 不会理解。</td></tr><tr><td>This sixth inner sense is concerned with the entity's innate working knowledge of the basic vitality of the universe, without which no manipulation of vitality stuff would be possible.As, for example, you could not stand up straight in your physical universe without first having among other things an innate sense of balance.</td><td>这第六内在感官所涉及的，是存有对宇宙基本生命力之与生具来的操作知识，没 有这种知识，就不可能操纵生命力的东西。就比如，你在物质宇宙中，除其他事 项外，如果没有先天的平衡感等，就无法站直身体。</td></tr><tr><td>This sixth sense is too important to skim over, and yet I wanted to mention it this evening because it fits in with our discussion.Without this sixth sense, and without its constant use by the inner self-conscious ego, you could not even construct the physical camouflage universe of your own plane.This sense, again, is used constantly beneath the outer egos awareness, and forms the basis for camouflage constructions on every plane.</td><td>这个第六感官太重要了，不能一略而过，然而我想在今晚提到它，因为它与我们 的讨论相吻合。如果没有内在自觉的自我不断地运用它，你甚至无法构建自己层 面的物质伪装宇宙。这个感官，也是在外在自我觉知的底层之下，不断地被使用，并且构成了每个层面上伪装构造的基础。</td></tr><tr><td>The material I am giving you here is very fragmentary.However, I want the outline to go along, and I will always continue to fill in.This sixth inner sense is so important that this material should be read thoroughly, as it will end up as one of the basic parts of our material, from which many other important discussions will follow.</td><td>我在这里所提供给你们的资料是非常零散的。然而，我要大纲继续下去，我会一 直继续补充内容。这个第六内在感官是如此重要，所以这份资料应该要仔仔细细

receive it.Too bad for the poor doctor.</td><td>如果我们做了一次那样的事，如果鲁伯让它不失真的传过来，理论上，我们的资 料将参杂着股市报告。每个人都想知道如何战胜股市，资料很快就会瓦解。知识才是我想传达给你的，以及任何准备好并能够接受它的人。可怜的医生，真不 幸。</td></tr><tr><td>("Oh, I don't think he's

She lay quietly on the couch, eyes closed, but in a few minutes told me she was awake.She also told me she had been visited by a most strange sensation; and from her description of it I felt sure it must be an exploration of the inner senses, similar to the one I experience occasionally, which Seth has called the feeling of sound.I thought Jane's description most remarkable."</td><td>(8 点 45 分，我走进客厅去叫醒珍，她安静地躺在沙发上，闭着眼睛，几分钟后告诉我，她醒了。她还告诉我，她被一种极其古怪的感觉袭上身来；从她的描述 中，我确信这一定是一种对内在感官的探索，类似于我偶尔会经验到的，赛斯称之为声音的感觉。我觉得珍的描述异常精彩。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane told me that upon slowly coming awake from her nap, and while she was listening to me move about the living room setting up the desk and my pad, etc.  , for the session, she had the most peculiar feeling of "growing larger." The first laughing phrase she used was that she felt as though she was as big as an elephant.</td><td>(珍告诉我，当她从小睡中慢慢醒来，听着我在客厅里走动，为课程准备桌子和我 的笔记本之类的事务时，她有一种非常奇特的感觉，就是"变大了"。她用的第一个好笑的句子是，她觉得自己大得像一头大象。</td></tr><tr><td>(The feeling was predominant in her head and arms, but was also slowly spreading into the lower parts of her body.It was as though, she said, her boundaries of awareness had expanded.It was not that she felt thickheaded, but as though the skull itself was literally expanding.Holding her hands out on either side of her head, she indicated a width to me of perhaps two and a half feet; she said her head felt, literally, that wide.</td><td>(这种感觉先是以头部和手臂为主，但也在慢慢向下半身蔓延。她说，好像她觉察 的边界扩大了。这并不是说她觉得头皮发胀，而是好像头颅本身真的在扩张。她伸出双手放在头的两侧，向我表示大概有两尺半的宽度；她说她感觉她的头，真的有那么宽。</td></tr><tr><td>(When we close our eyes, Jane said, we are aware of a certain "area" of blackness, an area we are used to.Her area while in this state was much enlargedâshe used  the phrase infinitely large to describe it.She was not aware of too much happening within this area, she said, just that it existed.Had she known more about it, we felt she might have understood more that would be going on in this extended black area.She was not frightened by the sensation, and went along with it.</td><td>(珍说，当我们闭上眼睛时，我们知道有某个黑暗的"区域"，那是我们习以为常的 区域。而当她在这种状态时，她的这块区域被扩大了很多--她用了"无限大"这个词 来形容它。她说，她并不知道在这个区域内发生的太多的事情，只知道它存在。如果她知道得更多，我们觉得她或许能明白更多，将在这扩大的黑色区域内发生什么。她并未被这种感觉吓到，而是顺势而为。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane said it was as though her eyes had actually moved farther apart, to create this expanded, broadened field of awareness, of infinite black.When she opened her eyes she felt a light snapping sensation that was very gentle, and not audible.She did not have the sensation when her eyes were open; but she said the physical sensation of this experience was so strong there could be no doubt of it.</td><td>(珍说，她的眼睛好像真的移到了更远的地方，形成了这个扩大的、拓宽的觉知领 域，无限的黑色领域。就在她睁开眼睛时，她感觉到一种啪一声的感觉，很轻 柔，听不到声音。在她睁开眼睛之后，她没有这种感觉；但她说这经验的身体感觉是如此强烈，那是毫无疑问的。</td></tr><tr><td>(It will be remembered that my first sensation episode, of February 8/64 [See page 172], jogged my memory so that I was able to recall a previous such experience of perhaps a year ago.In like manner Jane's experience reminded her that on two previous occasions she had experienced forerunners of this evenings sensation. "</td><td>还记得我在 64 年 2 月 8 日的第一次感觉事件[见第 172 页-英文版]，唤起了我的记忆，使我能够回忆起一年前的一次类似经历。同样地，珍的经验也提醒她，在之前的两个场合，她曾经历过像今晚这种感觉的前驱经验。</td></tr><tr><td>(She was not able to give me dates for either occasion. One was perhaps a few months ago, the other probably two or three years ago, she believes.Both were felt upon awakening, and while her eyes were closed.They hadn't made such an impression on her either time, because although she had felt the expanding of the skull, she had experienced nothing like the strange infinite black within this expanded area.</td><td>(她无法告诉我这两个场合的日期，她认为，一次可能是几个月前，另一次可能是 两三年前。两次都是在将醒时，眼睛仍是闭着的时候。两次都没有给她留下如此深刻的印象，因为她虽然感觉到了脑壳的扩张，但她没有经历过类似于这个扩张区域内的奇怪的无边黑色。</td></tr><tr><td>(I would like to add here that I again experienced my own sensation on Sunday afternoon at about 1:45 PM.We had driven to Sayre to visit my parents.At the time I happened to be alone in the living room, reading the paper, when the familiar thrilling swept over me to a fairly strong degree.I felt the residues of it for some time afterward.Although I was alone, there was much noise in the house, for my brother and his family were also there and his children were quite noisy.)</td><td>(我想在这里补充一下，周日下午 1 点 45 分左右，我又经验到我自己的那种感觉。我们驱车去萨伊尔看望我父母。当时我正好一个人在客厅里看报纸，这时熟 悉的刺激感以相当强烈的程度席卷了我。之后的一段时间里，我都感觉到了它的 残留。虽然我是独自一人，但整个屋子却很吵，因为我弟弟和他的家人也在那里，他的孩子很吵闹。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 39</td><td>第 39 节 第七内在感官</td></tr><tr><td>MARCH 30, 1964 9 PM MONDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964 年 3 月 30 日 晚上 9 点 星期一 按指示</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth made this session very brief, since Jane and I were quite tired by the time it began.We had changed our schedule, and our earlier hour of rising has made itself felt by session time.We did not really feel like holding a session, but tried anyhow because we did not want to break the routine.</td><td>(赛斯这节课上得非常短，因为课开始时我和珍都已经很累了。我们改变了作息时 间，我们过早的起床时间，到上课时间已经产生了影响。我们并不想上课，但还是试着去做，因为我们不想打破常规。</td></tr><tr><td>(We were back home from visiting company for supper by 8 PM.At 8:15 Jane lay down for a nap, and upon awakening at 8:45 experienced her sensation as described on pages 309/310.While she was telling me about it in the few minutes we had before the session was due, she did not appear to be nervous.</td><td>(我们参加了公司的餐宴，晚上 8 点到家。8:15，珍躺下小睡了一会儿，8 点 45 初醒时，经历了在前一节所描述的那奇特的感觉。在课前的几分钟里，她向我描述 了这个过程，她并没有显得紧张。</td></tr><tr><td>(Although Jane had slept she was still tired.While she was talking to me our cat Willy lay purring on her lap.Abruptly at 8:57 the session began.Jane stood up, dumping Willy to the floor.She began to dictate in a fairly strong voice; her eyes darkened as usual.And Willy began to tag after her as she paced back and forth.)</td><td>(虽然珍已经小睡过，但她还是很累。当她和我说话的时候，我们的猫咪威利躺在 她的腿上呼噜呼噜地叫。8 点 57 分，课突然开始。珍站了起来，把威利扔在地上。她用一个相当有力的声音开始传述；她的眼睛漆黑如常。她来回踱步时，威利尾随着她。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.

She asked me if she could share my studio with me and of course I agreed, having offered this arrangement some time ago.Her desk and books do not take up much room.Jane was so enthusiastic over this idea that she forgot to be nervous before the session began.</td><td>(8:45 分，珍小睡醒来，感觉神清气爽，她问我是否可以和她一起共用工作室，我当然同意，因为前段时间我已经提出了这个建议。她的书桌和书籍并不占用太多空间。珍对这个想法反应很热烈，连上课前的紧张都忘了。</td></tr><tr><td>(And of course by now both of us felt better, being more used to our new schedule.As the session began Willy continued to doze peacefully on the divan.Jane paced at a normal rate, her eyes darkened as usual, and her voice grew slightly husky.)</td><td>(当然，现在我们俩都感觉好多了，更习惯于新的作息时间。当课程开始时，威利 继续在沙发上安然地打着盹。珍以正常的速度踱着步子，眼睛漆黑如常，嗓音变得略带沙哑。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.")</td><td>("晚安。赛斯")。</td></tr><tr><td>I am glad to see that the atmosphere has cleared.I took a preliminary peek into your establishment earlier this evening and departed in dismayâin fear, in terror.</td><td>我很高兴看到气氛已经明朗了。今晚稍早的时候，我对你们的编制作了初步的窥 视，然后在沮丧中离开，带着害怕和惊恐。</td></tr><tr><td>("Now why?")</td><td>("为什么？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Well, I certainly would not want Ruburt throwing furniture at me.You understand of course that I am speaking of mock terror.When Ruburt's resentment finally flares, that is no time for me to be around.</td><td>我确实不想让鲁伯拿家具砸我。你当然明白，我说的是假装的害怕。当鲁伯的不 满终于爆发时，我可没时间陪着他。</td></tr><tr><td>("Nor me either.")</td><td>("我也没有"。)</td></tr><tr><td>You are quite right.The solution hit upon is an excellent one, and I had nothing to do with it, having decided that I was much safer if I left such decisions to you from now on.All joking aside, this latest idea should really be an excellent one, and I would have suggested it myself except that I could not get through to Ruburt.He has felt guilty over the thought of taking any space from you, and the guilt made him feel resentful.</td><td>你太对了。所提出的解决办法是一个很棒的法子，我与此无关，因为我决定从现 在起，把这种决定留给你来做我会安全得多。不开玩笑了，这个最新的主意确实 应该是个极好的主意，我自己也会提出来的，只是我无法透过鲁伯提出这样的建 议。他已经因为占用了你的空间的这个想法而感到内疚，这种内疚感让他感到恼 怒。</td></tr><tr><td>"I am quite pleased, you will benefit by this, and also from the other changes in your establishment that you have been considering, including a method of using the back room all year.Resentment had a lot to do with Ruburt's banging around.Not resentment at you, Joseph, but resentment because he felt guilty for not being satisfied.If you intend to stay where you are for any amount of time, then you would do well to get the most out of your establishment, and the enlargement being contemplated would be very beneficial. "</td><td>你们会因这个解决方案而获益，我非常满意，你们也会从一直在考虑的其他的安 置中，包括全年使用后面房间的办法而获益。怨气与鲁伯的敲锅打碗有很大的关 系。不是怨你，约瑟，而是不满，因为他对自己的不满足而感到内疚。如果你打 算在原地呆上一段时间，那么你就应该好好地利用你已有的设施，而正在考虑的 扩大计划也会很有帮助。</td></tr><tr><td>Incidentally, I share Ruburt's annoyance with your fat neighbor across the way, and I will tell you some tales about him before I am finished.</td><td>顺便说一句，我跟鲁伯一样，也讨厌你们路对面的那位胖邻居，在我说完之前， 我会告诉你们一些关于他的故事。</td></tr><tr><td>(This reference concerns new tenants who have moved into the second-floor apartment of the house next door Although our house is separated from it by quite an expanse of lawn, our new neighbor is quite obvious as he walks back and forth before his picture window in his undershirt.Jane considers this bad manners.)</td><td>(这说的是邻栋二楼公寓刚搬进来的新房客，虽然我们的房子与隔壁公寓隔着一片 草坪，但新邻居穿着内衣在落地窗前来回走动的样子看得很清楚。珍认为这样很没礼貌。)</td></tr><tr><td>The needed change that you both need can be met in your present environment by enlarging your kitchen, and unless you can move into the country, I would not suggest that you move at all.Naturally I prefer that you feel secure and as settled as possible, for the simple reason that the sessions will go better.</td><td>你们两人所需要的改变，可以在现有的环境中，通过扩大厨房来达成，除非你们 能搬到乡下，否则我根本不建议你们搬家。当然，我更希望你们有安全感，并尽 可能地安顿下来，原因很简单，这样课程可以进行的更好。</td></tr><tr><td>The two changes, one in the back, and your kitchen, will satisfy you both to a large measure for quite a while, and therefore are desirable since they do not entail a wholesale breaking up of daily pattern.I trust I have said enough along these lines.</td><td>这两个改变，一个是后面的房间，一个是你们的厨房，会有很长的一段时间让你 们俩都满意，因此是可行的，因为它们不需要全盘打破日常模式。我相信我在这 方面已经说得够多了。</td></tr><tr><td>As I mentioned, the sixth inner sense involves something that can be likened to what you call the instincts, except that it is a property of the inner self.Consider a spider spinning a web.The web is a camouflage pattern that definitely exists on your plane.Here your simple spider is using his sixth sense, for these senses are the latent property of other living things, and not restricted to mankind.</td><td>我提过，第六种内在感官涉及的东西，可以类比于你们所说的本能，只不过它是 内在自己的一种属性。试想一下蜘蛛结网。蜘蛛网就是确实存在于你们层面上的 伪装模式。这里，你们那简单的蜘蛛正在使用牠的第六感官，因为这些感官是其 他生物的潜在属性，而不限于人类。</td></tr><tr><td>"What you have in the spider's activity amounts to a demonstration of the sixth inner sense almost in its pure form.The spider has no intellect or outer ego, and his manipulations are the direct result of activities performed by pure and spontaneous use of the inner senses.They are unhampered and un-camouflaged to a great extent. "</td><td>你们所见到的蜘蛛的举动，相当于，几乎是以纯粹的形式对第六种内在感官的示 范。蜘蛛没有理性的思考能力或外在自我，牠的操控是通过纯粹和自发地使用内 在感官进行活动的直接结果。牠们在很大程度上没有受到阻碍，没有伪装。</td></tr><tr><td>All of the inner senses are not utilized to the same degree on any plane.Many planes are given over to the training in the use of one or two of the most important inner senses.I liked the analogy of the spider and his web because it is such a simple and uncomplicated example of camouflage construction, divorced from intermediaries such as ego or tools.</td><td>所有的内在感官在任何层面上，都没有得到同样的程度的利用。许多层面都被用 于训练使用一两个最重要的内在感官。我喜欢蜘蛛和牠的网的这个比喻，因为它 是这样一个简单而不复杂的伪装结构的例子，它脱离了自我或工具的中介。</td></tr><tr><td>Inherent, and I repeat inherent in the spider as in man, is the complete comprehension, or rather comprehension through direct experience, of the universe as a whole.In its particular existence the spider is not aware of all this knowledge, but it uses what is necessary of it to construct its web.It experiences directly.There is of course no "I" consciousness, but there is direct consciousness, nevertheless, of the most intimate kind.</td><td>与生具来，我重复一遍，在蜘蛛之内就像人类一样，天生具有把宇宙作为一个整 体的完整理解，更确切地说，是透过直接经验而来的理解。蜘蛛这样的一个存 在，牠并不知道所有这些知识，但牠使用其中必要的知识来构建牠的网。牠直接 经历。当然，牠没有"我"这个意识，但有直接意识，然而，是最密切的那种。</td></tr><tr><td>Give the spider an ego and an intellect and you will see then how the picture would change.These would enable him to enlarge upon his scope of awareness and activity, but at the same time impediments would be placed so that the web construction would no longer appear either as direct as far as its source is concerned, nor as spontaneous.</td><td>如果赋予蜘蛛一个自我，和理性思考能力的话，你就会看到情景会如何改变。这 些将使牠能够扩大牠的觉知和活动范围，但与此同时，障碍也将随之而设，因此，结网就其源头而言，将不再显得直接，也不再是自发的。</td></tr><tr><td>You construct your own camouflage existence as the spider constructs his web, but you are not aware of the threads.You do not understand that they originate within yourself, although it is very simple to smile as the lowly spider weaves its web.The spiders construction is severely limited to one plane, but this is not the case with your constructions, which may have reality on many planes at once, and in ways with which you are not familiar.</td><td>你们构建自己的伪装存在，就像蜘蛛编织牠自己的网一样，但你没有觉知到这些 线。你不明白它们源自于你自己，微笑很简单，如同低等的蜘蛛能织网。蜘蛛的 建构被严格地限制在一个层面上，但你们的建构却不是，它可能在许多层面上同 时呈现它的实相，而且是以你们不熟悉的方式。</td></tr><tr><td>It should be obvious that although an idea is born in time, after its conception it is free from time in a way that a spiders web can never be free from time.To the extent that a construction exists as camouflage, to that extent it is bound by and vulnerable to physical laws.</td><td>应该很明显的是，虽然想法是在时间内诞生，但它在被孕育出来之后，就脱离了 时间的束缚，以一种蜘蛛网永远无法从时间脱离出来的方式。在建构作为伪装而 存在的范围内，在那个范围内，它受物理规律的约束和影响。</td></tr><tr><td>If energy is imprisoned or focused into the physical construction to the extent that a construction appears on your plane, while still not fully constructed, left incomplete in some aspects, to that extent the idea behind the construction is not bound by physical laws.</td><td>如果能量被禁锢或聚焦在物质构造中到了一定的程度，以至于构造出现在你们的 层面，但尚未完全构造好，在某些方面仍然不完整，在这个程度上，构造背后的 理念就不受物理规律的约束。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break.</td><td>我建议稍作休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:31.Jane was dissociated to a fair degree.By break time her delivery had become very deliberate, with quite a few pauses.Her voice was normal.The same conditions prevailed when she resumed at 9:36.)</td><td>(9:31。珍解离到相当程度。休息之前，她的传讯变得非常慎重，有不少停顿。她的声音正常。9:36 恢复时，情况仍是如此。)</td></tr><tr><td>The tissue capsule of which I have spoken earlier surrounds every living consciousness.To some extent it could be compared to an extra layer of skin surrounding the physical body, except that it is not constructed in the same manner upon your plane, and is invisible to you under ordinary circumstances.</td><td>我前面说过的组织膜囊，包裹着每一个活生生的意识。在某种程度上，它可以被 比作为包覆肉体的一层额外的皮肤，只是它在你们的层面上，不是以同样的方式 构成的，在一般情况下你是看不见的。</td></tr><tr><td>It is actually a field, that is energy field, boundary.It protects the inner self by acting as a barrier that keeps the whole self's energy controlled, and keeps it from seeping away.At the same time it protects the whole self from certain radiations which do not here concern you.No living consciousness exists on any plane without this tissue capsule enclosing it.</td><td>它其实是一个场，一个能量场，围场。它通过作为一个屏障来保护内在自己，使 整体自己的能量得到控制，并使能量不至于渗出。同时它也保护整体自己不受某些辐射的影响，这些辐射目前与你们无关。如果没有这个组织膜囊的包围，任何 层面上都不会有活生生的意识存在。</td></tr><tr><td>The capsule of course is not a solid on any plane.To some inhabitants of other planes that have access to your plane, all that can be seen of you is this tissue capsule, since such inhabitants have had no experience in your particular type of camouflage construction.Therefore your camouflage patterns are invisible to them, but the tissue capsules are not.</td><td>当然，这个膜囊在任何层面上都不是实体。对于一些可以进入你们层面的其他层 面的居民来说，能被看到的只有这个组织囊，因为这些居民对你们特定形式的伪 装建构没有任何经验。因此你们的伪装模式对他们来说是看不见的，但看得见组 织囊。</td></tr><tr><td>These capsules can be seen by you under certain circumstances, and have been called astral bodiesâa term which does not meet with my pleasure.I would like to repeat again the fact that in many instances, and with exceptions, ideas not fully constructed on your plane not only have great force but are also freer from the effects of physical laws.The idea has at its command then greater and varied methods of expression, and from it varieties of construction can be attempted.I have mentioned the advantages of a painting over a piece of sculpture, and an idea not fully captured will find further expression.</td><td>这些囊在某些情况下可以被你们看到，并被称为星光体—一个不合我意的术语。我想再次重申一个事实：许多情况下，除了例外的情况，在你们的层面上尚未完 全建构起来的想法，不仅具有巨大的力量，而且也更能摆脱物理规律的影响。想 法随它自己的控制，有更多和更多样的表达方法，而由此，可以尝试各式各样的 建构。我提到过，一幅画的优势胜过一件雕塑，一个没有被完全捕捉到的想法， 会找到进一步的表达方式。</td></tr><tr><td>This is not to say that perfection is not to be sought after.It is of course impossible to achieve but the almost-completed leaves room for further development of the idea, and the idea is not imprisoned.</td><td>这并不是说不应该追求完美。它当然是不可能实现的，但几近完美，可以为想法 留下进一步发展的空间，思想并没有被禁锢。</td></tr><tr><td>The portrait that you sent to the gallery is evocative.It continues to grow.It is not completely at the mercy of a completed camouflage.The whole self is never completely constructed on your plane.At best it finds expression now and then.A camouflage plane, merely by being what it is, makes it impossible for the whole self to find expression.There is almost hypnotic focus of energy for a particular time for a particular reason.</td><td>你寄给画廊的那幅肖像画让人回味无穷。它还在继续成长。它并不完全受制于已 完成的伪装。整体自己从来不会在你们的层面完全被建构出来。充其量是它偶尔 找些表达。一个伪装层面仅凭着它之所是，不可能让整体自己找到表达。有几乎 是催眠式的能量，集中在某一特定的时间，出于特定的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner self is always there.You are always aware of it in the same manner that you are aware of what is happening in a trance.This is another excellent analogy, if you'll forgive me for patting myself on the back.</td><td>内在自己总是在那里。如同你在恍惚状态中觉察到正在发生的事情一般，你以同 样的方式觉察内在自己的存在。这又是一个很棒的比喻，如果你原谅这自我吹捧 的话。</td></tr><tr><td>This sixth sense is one of the basic ones which makes use of the others possible.Mankind often confuses it with, and calls it, instinct.It is merely the innate knowledge which makes manipulation of energy from one form to another possible, and you use it constantly.The spider is more familiar with it in its pure form than you are.That is, than mankind is.</td><td>这个第六感官是基本感官之一，它使其他感官的使用成为可能。人类常常把它混 淆了，而称它为直觉。它只是与生具来的知识，它使操纵能量从一种形式到另一 种形式成为可能，你一直在使用它。蜘蛛比你更熟悉它的纯粹形式。就是说，比 人类更熟悉。</td></tr><tr><td>It is this sense which directs your own growth physically, and which forms the cells of your physical body and constantly changes the stuff of your body.</td><td>正是这个感官指导着你自己的身体成长，它形成了你身体的细胞，并不断地改变 着你身体的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break.</td><td>我建议稍作休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:02.Jane reached the same degree of dissociation as she did during the first monologue.Her delivery was still quite deliberate, her voice quite soft.The same conditions prevailed when she resumed at 10:08.)</td><td>(10:02 休息。珍解离的程度和她在第一段独白时一样。她的传述仍然相当从容， 声音相当柔和。10:08 恢复时，状况仍然如此。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your plane is a training place in the use of manipulation of energy.Your plane seems to deal with cause and effect, but this is in itself a necessary camouflage.In actuality there is no cause and effect as you think of it.There is only spontaneity.For a particular interval you must be taught as if there were cause and effect, so that the result of spontaneity would not end up as chaos.This statement may seem contradictory but later you will see that it is not.</td><td>你们的层面是一个使用操控能量的训练场。你们的层面似乎在处理因果，但是， 这本身就是一种必要的伪装。实际上并不存在你们所认为的因果。有的只是自发 性。对于一个特定的时间间隙，你们必须被教育成好像有因果关系，这样自发性 的结果，就不会以混乱而告终。这句话看似矛盾，但以后你会发现并不矛盾。</td></tr><tr><td>Now that we have briefly discussed the meaning of a tissue capsule I will go into the seventh inner sense a bit more deeply.This sense allows for an expansion or contraction of the tissue capsule.Theoretically there is no limit to the contraction or expansion allowed, but practically there are usually definite limitations.</td><td>现在我们已经简单地讨论了组织囊的涵义，我将更深入地探讨第七内在感官。这 种感官容许了组织囊的扩张或收缩。理论上说，被容许的收缩或扩张是没有限制 的，但实际上往往有一定的限制。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane, as Seth, began a most entertaining performance.To this point Jane had been sober, quiet and dignified.Now she began to grin broadly.Often, to emphasize a point, she would lean over my desk, smiling.She appeared to be enjoying herself very much.Her eyes were very dark. The very tone of her voice changed to one of amusement.I have seen Jane display mirth in the sessions before, but this period of such feeling lasted far longer.Now she tapped on my desk.)</td><td>(现在珍，作为赛斯，开始了最富娱乐性的表演。在此刻之前，珍一直很清醒， 安静和凝重。现在，她开始咧着嘴笑。经常，为了强调某一点，她还面带微笑、 靠在我的桌子上。她看起来相当自得其乐。她的眼睛很黑，说话的语气也变成了 一种欢快的调子。我以前也见过珍在课上展现出的欢乐，但这一次这样的感觉持 续得更久。现在她轻拍着我的桌子。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am only going to hint of something here.For fun, think of the expanding tissue capsule in terms of or in connection with, the theory of your expanding universe.Such contemplation should be excellent exercise.This is quite evocative, and I hope I can peek in sometime when you are trying to deal with it.</td><td>我在这里只想暗示一些东西。为了好玩，可以从你们宇宙膨胀的理论，或与之相 关的角度，来思考扩张的组织囊。这样的沉思应该是很好的练习。这相当令人玩 味，希望在你尝试练习时，我能在某个时候偷瞄一眼。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again a big grin.)</td><td>(又一个咧嘴而笑。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will explain it to you, but at a much later date.Also, understand that what you think of or experience as space travel is another camouflage.Space travel so-called is an idea that makes sense only on your plane.I'm saving these little tidbits for you this evening.</td><td>我会跟你们解释，但要在更久以后。另外，你要明白，你认为或经验到的太空旅 行，是另一种伪装。所谓的太空旅行，是一个只有在你们的层面上才有意义的想 法。今晚我把这些小插曲留给你。</td></tr><tr><td>("So I noticed."</td><td>("我注意到了。"</td></tr><tr><td>(Another smile, another tap on the desk.)</td><td>(又一次微笑，又一次轻拍着桌子。)</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps a rereading of the material on fifth dimension will help you here, and one of these days we will carry that discussion further.In actuality, use of the inner senses will get you anywhere you want to go.The idea of destination in these terms is laughable.Every place is one place.You do the dividing and the separations.That is why your flying saucers are so funny to me.</td><td>也许重读一下关于第五维度的资料会对你有所帮助，总有一天我们会进一步讨论 这个问题。实际上，使用内在感官能把你带到任何你想去的地方。对于目的地这种说法，是很好笑的。每个地方都是一个地方。是你们在做划分和分离。这就是 为什么你们的飞碟对我来说如此好笑。</td></tr><tr><td>("Funny?")</td><td>("好笑?")</td></tr><tr><td>Funny because you think of them as vehicles traveling through your own camouflage space.Any vehicles would travel through their own camouflage space, and in some instances are doing so, even now, in the so-called space taken up by your earthly universe.</td><td>好笑，因为你认为它们是穿越你们自己的伪装空间的飞行器。任何载具都能穿越 自己的伪装空间，而且在某些情况下，甚至是现在，在被你们的尘世宇宙所占据 的所谓空间里，也正在这样做。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again Jane was leaning over my desk.</td><td>(珍又靠在我的桌子上。</td></tr><tr><td>("What's so funny!""</td><td>("什么那么好笑！"</td></tr><tr><td>(A Kennedy rocker sat opposite my desk.Now Jane sat down there.She laughed.Her eyes were merry.She sipped at a small glass of wine as she dictated to me.It was one of the few times I had seen her sit down during a session.)</td><td>(我桌子对面摆着一张甘迺迪摇椅。现在珍坐在那里。笑着。眼神愉悦。在向我传 述时，啜了一小杯酒。这是我看到的为数不多的一次，她在课程中坐下来。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am laughing because they fly through, in your terms, the very core of what you presume to call solid earth, which is not solid to them at all.And in certain instances as you attempt space travel, you will travel through what inhabitants on another plane will think of as their own particular "solid"âin quotesâand you will never know the difference.</td><td>我之所以笑，是因为用你们的话说，它们飞过了你们自以为是固体地球的核心， 而对它们来说，地球根本就不是固体。而在某些情况下，当你试图太空旅行时， 你会经过另一个层面，那里的居民则认为那是他们自己特定的"固体"—加引号—而你永远不会知道其中的区别。</td></tr><tr><td>Now this does not mean that a stationary body of any kind cannot materialize itself upon another plane.And if it does, it of necessity must in some manner surround itself with the constructions or camouflage of the particular plane which it attempts to enter.This takes a high level of inner development.</td><td>这并不意味着一个固定的身体不能在另一个层面上具体化自己。如果这样做，它 必须以某种方式，用它试图进入的特定层面的建构或伪装围绕着它自己。这需要 高度的内在发展。</td></tr><tr><td>You can, or you will be able to, travel within your own camouflage universe.There are other intelligent identities in it and they are on your own plane.This is travel along what we may call for simplicity's sake a horizontal level.</td><td>你们可以，或者说，你们将能够在自己的伪装宇宙内旅行。在这里存在着其他的智能本体(identities)，它们也在你们自己的层面。为简单起见，这种旅行我们可以称之为水平层面的旅行。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Jane rose and began to pace about once again.)</td><td>(现在珍起身，又开始踱步了。)</td></tr><tr><td>Are your fingers tired?</td><td>你的手指累了吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("No.  ")</td><td>("不累")。</td></tr><tr><td>The inhabitants of the flying saucers are not of your own plane.I have mentioned the struggle of form involved.You will have to remember in any of the discussions along these lines that your physical constructions simply do not exist except on your own plane.Other constructions exist simultaneously with your own, of an entirely different nature, also however on what you may call a horizontal plane.But you will never find them in a spaceship.</td><td>飞碟的居民不属于你们的层面。我提过其中所涉及的形态上的挣扎。你们必须记 住，任何这方面的讨论，你们的物质结构只存在于你们自己的层面上，在其他层面根本不存在。其他的建构与你们自己的建构同时存在，性质则完全不同，然 而，也在你们所称为的水平层面上。但你永远不会在宇宙飞船中找到它们。</td></tr><tr><td>Out of sympathy for your camouflage fingers I will let you take a break.I certainly enjoy taking you by surprise.</td><td>出于对你伪装手指的同情，我让你休息一下。我喜欢给你们一个出其不意。</td></tr><tr><td>("I'm glad you're getting such a kick out of it.")</td><td>("很高兴你从中得到这么大的乐趣。")。</td></tr><tr><td>I am in good form this evening.</td><td>我今晚的状态很好。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:32.Jane was in her usual state of dissociation this time.See the 16th session for Seth's dissertation on flying saucers and their dilemma of form. "</td><td>(10:32 休息。珍解离如常。详见第 16 节赛斯关于飞碟及其形状之两难困境的论述。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane said that during the above monologue she also had a mental image from Seth.It was of a series of circles reaching out from her.Our plane would be one circle; and at the moment we were marooned on it, unable to leave it for another circle.</td><td>(珍说，在上述独白中，她还从赛斯那里得到了一个心象。那是一连串从她身上延 展出去的圆圈。我们的层面就是其中一个圆圈，目前我们被困在上面，无法离开它到达另一个圆。</td></tr><tr><td>(She said she also had the feeling the quality of this material had something to do with psychological time, yet in a way that had nothing to do with gaining time.She felt Seth would discuss this after break.She sat down during part of her delivery at Seth's bidding, so that I wouldn't miss any of the material.Also, her broadly smiling face felt different than usual to her; Jane said she really felt Seth's emotions during this delivery, and added that Seth thought he was being smart. "</td><td>(她说，她也有一种感觉，这个资料的品质与心理时间有关，而与赢得时间无 关。她觉得赛斯会在休息后讨论这个问题。她在传述的部分过程中，照赛斯的吩 咐坐了下来，好让我不会遗漏任何资料。另外，她那咧嘴一笑的面容，感觉和平 时不一样，珍说她在这次传述中，真的感觉到了赛斯的情绪，并补充说，赛斯认 为他自己很聪明。</td></tr><tr><td>(She said her fingers felt a little fatter, but when we examined them we could see no difference.The feeling was predominant in her right hand and index finger especially.Jane had a let-down feeling during this break when she was able to relax, and said she needed the longer rest.Her voice was normal when she began dictating again.Resume at 10:43.)</td><td>(她说她的手指有点胖，但我们检查时看不出有什么不同。这感觉在右手比较明显，尤其是食指。在休息期间，珍有一种放松的感觉，她说她需要较长时间的休 息。当她再次开始传述时，她的声音正常。于 10:43 继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>I speak in terms of vertical and horizontal only to make things easier for you.As far as the immediately-previous material is concerned, I let Ruburt in on the vertical so to speak.There was on his part a direct experience of my emotional vitality.</td><td>我以垂直和水平的说法来谈，只是为了方便大家。就刚才所说的资料而言，我让 鲁伯在垂直面进来，可以这么说。就他而言，他直接经历了我的情感活力。</td></tr><tr><td>Again this in no way implies an invasion of Ruburt by myself, but instead implies an extension on Ruburts part to make way for the experience.It is not a lessening of self but an extension of self, so that the self-awareness can include not only self but independent (you may call this other) self experience, to include a value that is usually lacking in your ordinary behavior patterns.</td><td>同样，这绝不意味着我自己对鲁伯的入侵，而是意味着，鲁伯那部分为这经历而 做的让步之一种扩展。这不是自己的减少，而是自己的延伸，所以自觉不仅包括 自己，还包括独立的(你可以称之为他者)自己之经验，以囊括你普通行为模式 中通常缺乏的价值。</td></tr><tr><td>(Once again Jane leaned over my desk to emphasize the material.Her delivery was very deliberate and careful.)</td><td>(珍又一次靠在我桌前以强调资料。她的讲解非常慎重和仔细。)</td></tr><tr><td>This value, or this particular extension of self to include other self experience, is one of the attributes that can be expected through the use of psychological time.It is an attribute that is independent of and free from your physical as well as clock time.You should remember the difference between physical time and clock timeâI have given them to you.</td><td>这种价值，或者说这种特殊的自己之延伸，包括其他的自己的经验，是通过运用 心理时间而可以预期的属性之一。它是一种独立于你们物理时间以及钟表时间的 属性，并且不受其影响。你应该记住物理时间和钟表时间的区别，我已经把资料 给了你。</td></tr><tr><td>This value or quality is simply beyond the boundary of your camouflage (underline) existence.There is no camouflage yardstick by which it can be measured, and yet as Ruburt will certainly testify it is a startling, valid and memorable experience.I will bring this to the foreground now more often in our sessions, as it is most valuable.Like an ordinary psychological experience it cannot be measured on your terms, and yet makes a noticeable impression upon the individual involved.</td><td>这种价值或品质根本就超出了你们伪装(下划线)存在的边界。没有任何可以衡 量它的伪装尺度，然而，正如鲁伯肯定会证明的那样，这是一次令人震惊、有效 和难忘的经历。以后在我们的课程中，我会更经常地把它带到前台，因为它是最 有价值的。就像普通的心理经验一样，它不能用你们的条件来衡量，但却能给当 事人留下明显的印象。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I would like to make a few remarks in connection with the inner senses.</td><td>现在，我想谈几点与内在感官有关的看法。</td></tr><tr><td>First of all, experimentation and interest is growing in an exterior fashion as far as what you call ESP is concerned.Your next momentous discoveries will be along these lines but not in the immediate future.In your camouflage universe you are severely hampered as far as space travel is concerned, by the time elements involved in the camouflage universe itself.On your terms it will simply take too long to get where you want to go.</td><td>首先，就你们所说的超感官知觉而言，在外观上，实验和兴趣正在成长。你们接 下来的重大发现，将属于这方面，但不是在近期。在你们的伪装宇宙中，就太空 旅行而言，你们受到伪装宇宙本身所涉及的时间元素的严重阻碍。以你们的条件，要想到达你们想去的地方，它就是需要极长的时间。</td></tr><tr><td>Scientists will begin to look for easier methods, and believe it or not, the first really important discovery will be made by an orthodox scientist out of pure desperation.The scientific communities are even now being forced to consider the possibilities of telepathy as a means of communication, and they will be forced further and further along these lines.</td><td>科学家将开始寻找更容易的方法，不管你信不信，第一个真正重要的发现，将由 一个正统的科学家，出于纯粹的绝望而发现。科学界现在甚至被迫考虑心灵感应 作为一种交流手段的可能性，他们将被迫越来越延着这些思路去研究。</td></tr><tr><td>It is very possible that you might (underline) end up in what you intend as a space venture only to discover that you have "traveled" (in quotes) to another plane.But at first you will not know the difference.</td><td>极有可能，你们原本打算做个太空冒险，却发现自己"穿越"(引号)到了另一个 层面。但一开始你们不会知道其中的区别。</td></tr><tr><td>Material such as I am giving you will be very important.</td><td>我正在给你们的资料，将是非常重要的。 我想就鲁伯对灵摆的尝试，做个简要说明。</td></tr><tr><td>I would like to make a brief note about Ruburt's attempts with the pendulum.</td><td>在涉及到你当前的严肃问题上，任何一个特定时刻所发生的事情，都可以信赖灵 摆给出的，来自潜意识的可靠信息。</td></tr><tr><td>On serious matters involving your present time, what is going on at any particular moment, the pendulum can be counted upon as giving valid information from the subconscious.</td><td>对于其他事项，此时需要一个轻度状态的催眠，并对提问有一个非常谨慎的措 辞。灵摆对无意识的肌肉言语会有反应，确实能给出来自潜意识的答案。我们涉</td></tr><tr><td>For other matters a light stage of hypnosis is necessary at this time, and a very careful phrasing of questions.The pendulum is responsive to unconscious muscular speech and does give answers from the subconscious. We are involved in something much deeper. Ruburts subconscious on its own is simply not capable of arriving at the knowledge that you are getting in our sessions.</td><td>及的是更深层次的东西。鲁伯的潜意识本身，根本无法达到你在我们的课程中所 获得的知识。</td></tr><tr><td>(Here Jane laughed.)</td><td>(这里珍笑了。)</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break. And if you do get your kitchen enlarged, then I hope you get a window overlooking the river too.This has been an excellent session.</td><td>我建议你先休息一下，如果你真的把你的厨房扩建了，那么我希望也有一扇俯瞰 河面的窗户。这一节课很棒。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:07.Jane tapped on my desk to make emphasis for the last line of her delivery.She was dissociated as usual.She said that the last two monologues found her way out; she did not remember pacing, smoking sipping drinks, etc.  She reported that just as her delivery ended, she had another mental picture.This time she saw herself in the enlarged kitchen, looking out of a horizontal-type window at the river.</td><td>(11:07 休息。珍在我的桌子上敲了敲，来强调她最后的那一句话。她解离如常。她说，最后两段独白总算说出来了，她不记得自己在踱步、抽烟喝饮料等等。她 说，就在她传述结束时，她又有了一个心象。这一次，她看到自己在扩建的厨房 中，从一个横型的窗户向外望着河。</td></tr><tr><td>(She went on to explain that she saw the back of her own figure as it stood before the window; she was Seth, she said, looking at her.I remarked that this session had certainly been rather active.Jane resumed dictating in a normal voice at 11:15.)</td><td>(她继续解释说，她看到了自己站在窗前的背影，她说，她是赛斯，在看着她。我 说，这节课真的相当活跃。11:15 珍继续传述，声音如常。)</td></tr><tr><td>I am making up in value on another scale entirely for the last time.It is very possible that you both may need a rest now and then, and if so you will get it.But for quite a while it will not involve missing sessions but shortening them.Right now you are both doing extremely well.Ruburt, incidentally, was right.I had intended giving you a week off after your first thirty sessions.However you didn't ask for them, and you didn't seem to need a vacation, so I took advantage of it.</td><td>我在完全不同的尺度上，为上一次传讯补足价值。你们俩很可能时不时地需要休息，如果是这样，你们会得到休息的。但在相当长的一段时间内，不会涉及到漏掉课程，但可以缩短课程。现在你们俩都做得非常好。顺便说一句，鲁伯是对 的。我本来打算在 30 节课结束后放你们一星期的假。但是你们没有要求，而且你们也似乎不需要度假，所以我就利用了这个机会。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again Jane laughed.</td><td>(珍又笑了。</td></tr><tr><td>("Oh.")</td><td>("哦。")</td></tr><tr><td>Conditioning and regularity is important as you know from your own work.  I am pleased over your portrait prize, Joseph, because the prize should make you aware of the fact that good work is recognized, and that despite the personal and unfortunate shortcomings of individuals as a whole they still do recognize good work, and you should give them credit for this.</td><td>正如你从自己的工作中知道的那样，调理和规律是很重要的，我为你的肖像奖感 到高兴，约瑟，因为这个奖应该让你意识到，好的作品终究会被赏识的，尽管个 人有一些不幸的缺点，但作为一个整体，他们还是能认可好的作品，你应该为此 给他们点赞。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again the smiling Jane tapped on my desk.)</td><td>(笑眯眯的珍又拍了一下我的桌子。)</td></tr><tr><td>If there is, and there is, stupidity and ignorance and idiotic unfounded pride and rationalizations, nevertheless there is also, at least occasionally, good intent and appreciation.I know that you are aware of the dangers involved in projecting your own fears and irritations upon others.There is always and oftentimes a justifiable tendency to feel unappreciated, and therefore to look for chances to prove this lack of appreciation, so that it is often mistakenly projected on remarks or actions of others.Oftentimes such remarks and actions are the result of the other person's own ignorance, and actually not directed at you personally.</td><td>如果有，也确实是有，愚昧、无知和白痴的妄自尊大和企图合理化，但至少偶尔 也有善意和欣赏。我知道你知道把自己的恐惧和恼怒投射到别人身上的危险。人 们总是而且经常有一种理所当然的倾向，觉得自己不被欣赏，因此寻找机会来证明这种不被欣赏的感觉，所以常常错误地把这种感觉投射到别人的言论或行动 上。很多时候，这种言行是对方自己无知的结果，其实并不是针对你个人的。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt in the past has been very sensitive as far as your work is concerned, and this year has seen some improvement.There is some need to be on guard but hardly any to be up in arms.</td><td>过去的鲁伯对于你的工作非常敏感，今年有了一些进步。需要保持一些警惕，但 几乎没有需要大动干戈的地方。</td></tr><tr><td>Incidentally it is possible that you and Ruburt and his friend at the art gallery and her husband may become good friends, but it would have been extremely inadvisable for you to have moved into her apartment.You both have known the woman before, and under unpleasant circumstances.As tenants you would have been extremely dissatisfied with her.</td><td>顺便说一句，你和鲁伯以及他在画廊的朋友和她的丈夫，有可能成为好朋友，但 你们搬进她的公寓是极不合宜的。你们俩以前都认识这个女人，而且是在不愉快 的情况下认识的。如果你们成为她的房客，你们会对她极为不满。</td></tr><tr><td>At one time she was in a subordinate position to you, Joseph, and without knowing why she would have been very domineering if you were a tenant.In the gallery relationship Ruburt is tacitly above her in the hierarchy and there is no difficulty.As friends a relationship would be excellent, as she would benefit very much, and you would both benefit by the help that you would be able to give her.</td><td>约瑟，曾有一次她是你的部属，如果你是她的房客，她会不明原因地非常霸道。在画廊的关系中，鲁伯的位阶是心照不宣地高于她，这没有任何困难。作为朋友 关系会是极好的，因为她将受益良多，从你们能给她帮助中，你们也将从中受益。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again Jane sat down opposite my desk, in the Kennedy rocker.Grinning broadly, her eyes very dark, sipping at a glass of wine, she leaned forward to tap the desk.)</td><td>(珍又坐在我书桌对面的甘迺迪摇椅里。她笑得很灿烂，眼睛很黑，啜饮着酒，她 倾身向前，轻拍着桌子。)</td></tr><tr><td>She worked on one of your farms in Denmark.She was, if you'll excuse the expression, no beauty, and at the time you were not one to look for spiritual values in your women.She resented this very much.She also resented your son.</td><td>她曾在你丹麦的一个农场工作。如果你不介意我这样表达，她并不漂亮，而在当 时，你并不是一个在你的女人身上寻找精神价值的人。她非常怨恨这一点。她也 怨恨你的儿子。</td></tr><tr><td>("And who was that?")</td><td>("那是谁？")。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt was your son, as you well know.And he was a painter, so that the art gallery is an ironic place for Ruburt and this woman to meet.</td><td>鲁伯是你的儿子，你很清楚。而他是位画家，所以画廊对鲁伯和这个女人来说是 个具讽刺意味的地方。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane began to pace again.)</td><td>(珍又开始踱步了。)</td></tr><tr><td>I could really go on.The history fascinates me.</td><td>我真的可以继续说下去。这个陈年往事很吸引我。</td></tr><tr><td>("Me too.")</td><td>("我也是。")</td></tr><tr><td>There are also some rather hilarious incidents involved.As when you, old reprobate, took over your son's mistresses when you got the chance; but you did not get the chance too often.There was also the case of taking some rent out through flesh when the cash was not forthcoming.</td><td>其中还涉及到一些比较好笑的事件。当你，一个老恶棍，有机会就把儿子的情妇 占为己有；但你的机会不多。也有在等不到现金的情况下，通过肉体来抵扣租金。</td></tr><tr><td>(I laughed.Seth-Jane was also quite amused.Seth has often referred to my life in Denmark in the 1600s as being one of the flesh, and has said that his own was not much better.The material on the preceding page is about as definite as he has yet been on what actually transpired there.He has also stated that he will have much fun with Jane and me as he reveals those existences to us.This seems to be a case in point.)</td><td>(我大笑。赛斯-珍也觉得好笑。赛斯常把我在 16 世纪丹麦的生活称为肉体的生 活，并说他自己也好不到哪里去。前一页，是关于那里实际发生的事情，迄今为 止最明确的资料。他还说，当他向我们揭露那些过往发生的事时，他会与珍和我 一起讲得很开心。这似乎是一个很好的例子。)</td></tr><tr><td>If your prefer we will end the session.Otherwise take a brief break.And may I congratulate you in a backhanded fashion for having a full session this evening.Triev was a nice place.</td><td>如果你愿意，我们就结束这一节。否则就休息一会。请允许我反讽地恭喜你，今 晚上了完整的一堂课。特里夫是个好地方</td></tr><tr><td>("How big was it?"</td><td>("它有多大？"</td></tr><tr><td>(See the 2nd session, page 14.  )</td><td>(见第 2 节)。</td></tr><tr><td>5,000 approximately.Actually it was between 5,000 and 15,000âno more than 15,000.Do you want to end the session?</td><td>大约 5,000 人。实际上是 5000 到 15000 之间，不超过 15000。你想结束课程吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("I think so.I don't want to but I guess we'd better.Jane is getting tired.")</td><td>("我想是的。我不想这样，但我想最好还是结束比较好。珍是越来越累了。")</td></tr><tr><td>All things in good time, and believe you me, we shall have some good times.Incidentally, Ruburt is not pregnant.Put this in the record or not as you choose.</td><td>所有的事情都来得正是时候，相信我，我们的确过了一段好时光。顺便说一句， 鲁伯并没有怀孕。是否把这个放入记录，你自己决定。</td></tr><tr><td>The ordinary seasonal influx with chemical variations usual in her case, plus your mother's phone call, the niece's pregnancy, and with your help, brought upon the circumstances.Your help incidentally refers to your anger at the children.It raised Ruburt's hidden hopes of a larger apartment and then dashed them, building up his resentment.You forget that Ruburt-Jane's first impulse is to act.This is extremely important in his makeup.It is for this reason that the extended use of the back room, and even the work on the kitchen would be beneficial.Need I say that his corner in your room must be felt by him to be his own.</td><td>她的情况，通常是由于一般季节性的涌现与化学变化，再加上你母亲的电话，侄女的怀孕，以及你的帮助带来的情况。顺便一提，你的帮助指的是你对孩子们的怒气。这让鲁伯暗暗升起了对更大的公寓的希望，然后又破灭了，使他的怨怼越积越多。你忘了鲁伯-珍的第一冲动是行动。这在他的性格中极为重要。正因为如 此，扩大使用后面的房间，甚至厨房的改装都会有帮助。我需要说，他在你房间所使用的那个角落，一定要让他觉得是他自己的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane laughed.)</td><td>(珍笑了起来。)</td></tr><tr><td>I could say more but I won't.</td><td>我可以说更多，但我不打算。</td></tr><tr><td>("And I'm afraid to ask.

This is the feeling Jane has mentioned so often.I found myself rubbing my hands together, subjectively aware of a swollen feeling in them as we talked after the session.The sensation began in both index fingers, then spread across the knuckles, down into the fingers, and into the palms.When I made fists there was a stretching and thick feeling in them.They felt alien.It was not painful in any way, merely a most intriguing feeling of engorgement.My index fingers especially appeared to be larger.I wear a ring on the fourth finger of my left hand, but unfortunately did not think to see if I could remove it.</td><td>(事情的发展是，今晚的惊讶还没结束。课一结束，我就发现我的手感觉很"胖"。这就是珍经常提到的感觉。在课程结束后的谈话中，我发现自己在搓手，主观上 意识到双手有一种肿胀的感觉。这种感觉从两个食指开始，然后蔓延到指关节， 向下蔓延到手指，再到手掌。当我握拳的时候，有一种拉伸和厚实的感觉。这感 觉很陌生。它没有任何痛感，只是一种耐人寻味的憋胀感。尤其是我的食指，显 得更大了。我左手无名指上戴着一枚戒指，可惜没有想到能不能摘下来。</td></tr><tr><td>(The feeling lasted for a few minutes.And Jane, remarking that she had experienced the same thing at 10:30 break, then made the intuitive leap to connect her own episodes of hand phenomena with the feeling of bodily enlargement she had experienced on March 30. See page 309.Neither of us had made this connection before, but Jane now felt sure that her fat hands had been the forerunners of a fuller use of the seventh inner sense.</td><td>(这种感觉持续了几分钟。而珍说她在 10:30 休息时，也经历了同样的事情，然后她直觉地将自己的手部现象，与 3 月 30 日经历的身体增大的感觉联系起来。我们俩之前并没有这种连结，但珍现在很肯定，她的胖手是更充分运用第七内在感官的先导。</td></tr><tr><td>(This made me wonder whether I too would be able to develop this particular sense.If so, it would give me rudimentary glimpses into two of the inner senses, since I have already had some small degree of success in feeling sound.)</td><td>(这让我好奇，自己是否也能发展这特殊的感官。如果是这样，那我就能有两种内 在感官的雏形一瞥，因为我已经在感觉声音方面取得了一点成功。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 41</td><td>第 41 节 广阔现在, 因果关系</td></tr><tr><td>APRIL 6, 1964 9 PM MONDAY AS INSTRUCTED</td><td>1964 年 4 月 6 日 晚上 9 点 星期一 按指示</td></tr><tr><td>(At about 6:30p.  m. Jane was reading a magazine article, and came across the word specious.She found herself reading the word as spacious; then the phrase "spacious present" came to mind.She did not feel Seth about, yet thought the phrase significant for some reason.</td><td>(下午 6:30 左右，珍在看一篇杂志文章时，看到了"specious" -似是而非这个词，她发现自己把它读成"spacious " -广阔；然后"spacious present"  "广阔的现在这个词浮现在脑海。她没有感觉到赛斯的存在，但又觉得这句话因某种原因而意义 重大。</td></tr><tr><td>(At 8:10 our cat Willy behaved in a most peculiar fashion.I was working in the middle room of our apartment; my studio is thus on my left, the living room on my right.Willy was sleeping in the closet.All was quiet when suddenly Willy burst out of the closet in a mad scramble, his nails sliding on the bare floor.His ears were back, his hackles up.Looking back into the empty studio, he raced into the living room, jumped up on a bookcase beneath a window and hid behind a curtain.</td><td>(8:10，我们的猫咪威利表现得非常奇怪。我在我们公寓的中间房间工作，我的工 作室在我的左边，客厅在我的右边。威利在衣柜里睡觉。一切都很安静，突然， 威利疯狂地从衣柜里冲了出来，牠的指甲在光秃秃的地板上滑着。耳朵往后竖 着，颈部的毛竖直起来。回头看了看空🗎🗎的工作室，牠跑进客厅，跳上窗户下 方的书架，躲在窗帘后面。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was reading in the living room, and Willy startled her.Both of us then watched him begin to very cautiously stalk back through the apartment toward the studio.Of course none of us saw anything.The studio was dark.Yet Willy spent at least five minutes making a careful survey of the studio; he remained in a very jumpy mood until just before the session began.</td><td>(珍在客厅里看书，威利吓了她一跳。然后我们俩都看着牠开始小心翼翼地穿过公 寓向工作室走去。当然，我们都没有看到什么。工作室里一片漆黑。然而威利却花了至少五分钟的时间对工作室进行了仔细的打量；直到课开始前，牠的情绪一直很紧张。</td></tr><tr><td>(At 8:45 Jane said she was not very ambitious. She was a little nervous."I like to keep busy right up to the session, ''she said "especially when I don't know what he's going to talk about."

"</td><td>一般来说，当我们谈论伪装时，我们关注的是物质伪装结构。蜘蛛网就是一个例 子，以及过去讨论过的桌子，它实际上是原子和分子的集合体，松散地固定在一 起，但被你的外在感官经验为一个坚实的伪装结构，可以在你们的伪装存在中使 用和操纵。</td></tr><tr><td>There are however many other camouflage patterns which do not exist as solid structures, but exist as ideas.</td><td>然而还有很多其他的伪装模式，它们并不是作为实体结构存在，而是作为理念存 在。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest that you take your first break before I go further into this discussion.</td><td>我建议你先休息一下，然后我再继续讨论。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26.Jane was dissociated as usual.Her delivery was very deliberate and quite slow.Willy lay sleeping now on the divan.Jane said she thought Seth would say something to the effect that on this plane we use ideas for protection from a true reality that might be too much for us to handle.Her voice was normal when she resumed at 9:32.)</td><td>(9:26 休息。珍解离如常。她的传述非常慎重，相当缓慢。威利现在躺在沙发上睡觉。珍说，她本来以为赛斯会说一些话，关于在这个层面上，我们用意念来保护自己不受真正实相的影响，而真正的实相可能让我们难以承受。当她在 9:32 恢复时，嗓音正常。)</td></tr><tr><td>These camouflage ideas are as real and as useful, if not more so, than physical camouflage patterns.They also enable you to manipulate, and they of course also serve to hide you from or shield you from direct reality experiences which you cannot handle on your plane.</td><td>这些伪装理念与物质伪装模式一样真实，一样有用，甚至更有用。它们还能让你 进行操控，当然它们也能让你躲避或屏蔽，在你们层面上无法处理的直接的实相 经验。</td></tr><tr><td>These idea camouflage patterns represent important if nonmaterial structures, and we will refer to them as idea camouflage structures from now on, since they are basic frameworks that control the actual physical camouflage patterns, and even supervise for you the extent to which such physical patterns can be constructed.</td><td>这些理念伪装模式代表着重要的，如果是非物质的结构，我们从现在开始将它们 称为理念伪装结构，因为它们是控制实际物质伪装模式的基本架构，甚至为你监 督这种物质模式可以构建到什么程度。</td></tr><tr><td>In other words these idea camouflage structures are prerequisites for your physical structures, and to the extent that these idea structures evolve, to that extent can your physical structures change.This is why, for example, you are hampered even in your physical constructions by the idea structures of time that you have erected.</td><td>换句话说，这些概念性伪装结构是你们物质结构的先决条件，这些概念结构演变 到什么程度，你们的物质结构就能改变到什么程度。这就是为什么，比如说，即 使在你们的物质建构中，你也会受到你所竖立的时间概念结构的阻碍。</td></tr><tr><td>The idea of past, present and future is a necessary one on your plane, but this certainly does not mean that time exists in the manner which you suppose.You are obsessed with the theory of beginning and end, because in your situation your camouflage constructions seem to have a beginning and an end.</td><td>过去、现在和未来的概念，在你们的层面上是一个必要的概念，但这当然不意味 着时间是以你所认为的方式存在。你们执迷于开始和结束的理论，因为在你们的 情况下，你们的伪装结构，似乎有一个开始和结束。</td></tr><tr><td>For the same reason you are also obsessed with the idea of cause and effect, with the illusion of successive time bringing forth the other.Here we have two of your most basic idea camouflage structures: your conception of time as a succession, and your idea of cause and effect.</td><td>出于同样的原因，你们也执迷于因与果的观念，执着于连续的时间带来另一个时 间的错觉。在这里，我们有两个你们最基本的理念伪装结构：你们对时间的概念 是连续的，以及你们因与果的观念。</td></tr><tr><td>(To emphasize the following paragraph, Jane leaned over the desk and spoke even more slowly and deliberately.Her eyes were very dark.)</td><td>(为了强调下面这段话，珍前倾到桌前，更加缓慢而慎重地说话。她的眼睛很 黑。)</td></tr><tr><td>There is no cause and effect in the terms in which you understand the words.Nor is there a succession of moments that follow one after the other; and without a succession of moments following one after the other you can see that the idea of cause and effect becomes meaningless.An action of the present in your terms cannot be based or caused by an action in the past, and neither action can be the cause of a future action in a basic reality where neither past nor future exist.</td><td>没有你们在字面上所理解的因果关系。也没有一个接着一个的连串片刻；如果没 有一个接着一个的时刻，你可以看到，因果的观念变得毫无意义。在一个不存在 过去与未来的基本实相中，当下的行动不能基于或由于过去的行动，当下的行动 也不能成为未来行动的肇因。</td></tr><tr><td>The distortive illusion of successive moments, and of the resulting conception of cause and effect, are both on your plane the result of the observation by the outer senses, and are practical and useful on your plane and therefore have a certain validity, if for you only.</td><td>连续时刻的扭曲错觉，以及由此产生的因果观念，在你们的层面上，都是外在感 官观察的结果，它们在你们的层面上是实际且有用的，因此具有一定的有效性， 但这仅适用于你们。</td></tr><tr><td>They represent a more or less true account of the nature of your camouflage universe, but if they are understood as being limited to your camouflage environment only, then your scientists would not attempt to use them as yardsticks to measure other universes.</td><td>它们或多或少代表了你们伪装宇宙性质的真实描述，但如果把它们理解为只限于 你们的伪装环境，那么你们的科学家就不会试图用它们作为衡量其他宇宙的标尺</td></tr><tr><td>The majority of your intellectual ideas apply to your own universe only and their validity only stands up within these limitations.I am not condemning or minimizing the importance of the intellect in any manner.The fact remains that the intellect is itself limited at this particular time, but these limitations of the intellect are not static and can be enlarged to some considerable extent.</td><td>你们大多数智性上的想法只适用于你们自己的宇宙，它们的有效性也只在这些限 制内站得住脚。我并没有以任何方式谴责或贬低智力的重要性。事实仍然是，智 力本身被限制在这个特定的时间内，但智力的这些限制并不是静止不变的，它可 以扩大到相当的程度。</td></tr><tr><td>The nature of basic reality is known according to the degree to which it is directly experienced, and it can only be directly experienced through the use of the inner senses.The inner senses are of course utilized on your plane, as on any other, constantly.Without any such use no existence would be possible.And without the unconscious and constant use of the inner senses you could not even construct your precious camouflage patterned universe.</td><td>基本实相的性质是根据它被直接经验的程度来认识的，它只能通过利用内在感官 来直接经验。内在感官当然在你们的层面上不断地被运用着，如同在任何其他层 面上一样。没有任何这样的利用，就不可能有任何存在。而如果没有无意识地不 断利用内在感官，你们甚至无法构建你们宝贝的伪装模式的宇宙。</td></tr><tr><td>Now before your fingers break, my dear Joseph, I suggest that you take a break.</td><td>现在，在你的手指断掉[break]之前，我亲爱的约瑟，我建议休息[break]一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:00.Jane was dissociated as usual.She also felt somewhat tired, as did I.

and, Joseph, the bulk of the sessions is somewhat shorter for two reasons.For one thing I am getting the data through to Ruburt in a clearer, more concise fashion, and thereby dispensing with many unnecessary phrases.Also, I do not have to backtrack as frequently.I have given you some shorter sessions, though not many, because of your own changed schedule, and because I work through your energies, your combined energies, in a way that I have yet to explain.</td><td>直接的内在经验经常中断并很少持续，原因是自我几乎立刻就会钳制住它，以检 查这个现象；而且，约瑟，大部分的课程都有些短，原因有二。其一，我正以更 清晰、更简洁的方式将资料传递给鲁伯，从而省去了许多不必要的词语。此外， 我也不必经常回过头来讲。我是给了你们一些较短的课程，虽然不多，因为你们 自己的时间表改变了，也因为我要透过你们的能量来工作，你们的综合能量，以 一种我尚未说明过的方式。</td></tr><tr><td>I have also slowed down now and then to enable you to write more comfortably.If these efforts on my part to make things easier are not appreciated, then I can speed up as fast as you would like.</td><td>我现在偶尔也放慢了速度，好让你能更舒服地做记录。如果我为了使事情轻松一 点，而所做的这些努力，没有得到感激，那么我可以加快速度到你喜欢的程度。</td></tr><tr><td>("Oh no.")</td><td>("哦，不要。")</td></tr><tr><td>If you prefer more active participation you may ask questions when you like.I try to follow through in particular discussions simply to make the material read in a somewhat orderly manner.You want me to talk about Denmark, that's your trouble.</td><td>如果你喜欢更积极的参与，你可以在想要的时候提出问题。我试图持续特定的讨 论，只是为了让资料读起来有某种次序。你要我谈丹麦，那你的麻烦就大了。</td></tr><tr><td>("No, I haven't asked for that.")</td><td>("没有，我没有要求过。")。</td></tr><tr><td>May I then consider myself free to follow along?</td><td>那么，我是否可以认为，自己可以自由地进行？</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes.

and yet in some manners the universe could be said to be expanding, but with entirely different connotations than are usually used.</td><td>他们的时间测量，一开始就是基于伪装，几乎完全不充分，必然会给出扭曲的资 讯，因为宇宙根本无法用这些条件来测量。宇宙并不是在任一特定时间被创造出 来，但也不是像一个充气的气球一样，永远膨胀变大到无边无际，至少在这方面 目前不被这样认为。膨胀是一种错觉，除了别的以外，它基于不充分的时间测 量，基于有限的因果理论；然而在某些方面，宇宙可以说是在膨胀，但其内涵与 通常所想的完全不同。</td></tr><tr><td>This is much too difficult to go into deeply now.It might help you to reread the little material on mental enclosures.Expansion you see is a word that implies movement or enlargement in space, and space itself in the way the word is usually used, is a camouflage.Space, I have said, is the fifth dimension, but you have seen that this true space has little in common with the space that you usually think of.That is, fifth dimensional space is not an emptiness to be filled, being itself alive and vibrant, and changing its outer nature according to the plane which is composed of it.</td><td>这些太难了，现在无法深入探讨。重读一下关于精神围场 mental enclosures 的那少许资料，也许对你们有帮助。你知道，扩张，是一个意味着在空间移动或扩大的词，而空间本身，按它通常被使用的方式来说，就是一种伪装。空间，我已经说过，是第五维度，但你们都已经看到，这个真正的空间与你们通常认为的空间没 有什么共同之处。也就是说，第五维空间并不是一个有待填补的虚空，它本身是 生机勃勃，充满活力的，并根据组成它的层面而改变着它的外在性质。</td></tr><tr><td>Therefore the expanding universe implies a universe expanding in a more or less empty space, and this is not true.The phenomena that are given as evidence of this kind of expanding universe are the result of camouflage instruments, distortive ideas of time, and the resulting cause and effect theory.</td><td>因此，膨胀的宇宙，或多或少意味着宇宙在一个空的空间里扩张，这是不正确 的。作为这种膨胀宇宙证据的现象，是伪装仪器、扭曲的时间观念以及由此产生 的因果理论的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take a break in your expanding universe.</td><td>我建议你们，在你们膨胀的宇宙中休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:05.Jane was dissociated as usual.By now we were both tired.Jane yawned and remarked that if she could be out until the end of the session she would be quite happy.This upset me, mostly because I felt the same way myself.I also felt the sessions were threatened, though I did not say so, but Jane instantly sensed my mood.When she began dictating again her pace was as slow and deliberate as before, her voice normal.Resume at 10:13. )</td><td>(10:05。珍解离如常。现在我们都累了。珍打着哈欠说，如果她能在外面待到课 程结束，她会很高兴。这让我很难过，主要是因为我自己也有同感。我也感觉这 个课程会受到威胁，虽然我没有说出来，但珍立刻就感觉到了我的情绪。当她再 次开始传述时，她的速度和以前一样缓慢而从容，声音正常。10:13 恢复)。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt during these sessions is also to some degree dependent upon your energy, Joseph, and more than normally sensitive to your moods.I have said that both of you are necessary.I can sense a lack of confidence on Ruburt's part when he senses any disturbance as far as you are concerned.I mention this because it then becomes more difficult for me to get the material through.</td><td>鲁伯在这些课程期间，在某程度上亦取决于你的能量，约瑟，而且对你的情绪比 平时更敏感。我说过，你们两人都是必要的，缺一不可。我能感觉到，当鲁伯察 觉到任何与你有关的干扰时，他就会缺乏信心。我之所以提这个，是因为这样一 来，我就更难把资料传过来。</td></tr><tr><td>If you are too tired to continue the session then by all means let me know.Do you have anything to say along these lines?</td><td>如果你太累了，无法继续这节课，那尽管告诉我。关于这些，你有什么想说的 吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("I guess not.I'm okay, let's continue.")"</td><td>("看来没有。我没事，我们继续吧。")。</td></tr><tr><td>"I wanted, then, to make another point about Ruburt's experience last night in connection with the inner senses.Ruburt was quite capable as far as ability was concerned, to know what time it was without the addition of the vision of the clock.This was secondary.It seems that on your plane there is almost always the temptation to translate inner data in terms that the ego can understand and interpret. "</td><td>那么，我想就鲁伯昨晚的经历再谈一点与内在感官有关的事情。就能力而言，鲁 伯很有能力知道现在是什么时间，而不需要加上时钟的视觉。这是次要的。似乎 在你们的层面上，几乎总是有一种倾向，就是把内在的资讯转译成自我可以理解 和解释的方式。</td></tr><tr><td>Because of your own inner visual ability you should be able to have experiences along these lines yourself without too much difficulty, the only danger in your case being perhaps a possible tendency to draw in, so to speak, extra material to complete a visual composition.After a few such experiences however you would not run into this difficulty.</td><td>由于你自己内在的视觉能力，你自己应该能够有这类的经验，而不至于有太大的 困难，对于你，唯一的危险也许是，可能有一种倾向，可以这么说，去引入额外 的资料，来完成一个视觉构图。不过，经过几次这样的经历，你就不会遇到这样 的困难了。</td></tr><tr><td>If many of the inner senses behave as if your conception of time and space do not exist, then the obvious reason is of course that they do not.You are merely allowing yourself a momentary release from the limitations of camouflage ideas, and release of these ideas brings a corresponding release from the physical camouflage patterns themselves.There is a breaking through.Now this breaking through is a release of the inner self from the camouflage, and the resulting camouflage laws of any particular plane.The barriers to such experiences are mainly those set up by the ego.The sort of experience Ruburt had last night is one of the simplest along these lines.</td><td>如果许多的内在感官，表现得好像你们的时间和空间概念不存在，那么明显的原 因当然是，它们不存在。你只是让自己暂时摆脱伪装观念的限制，而这些观念的 释放，会带来物质伪装模式本身的相应释放。这就是一种突破。这种突破就是内 在自己从伪装中释放，以及由此产生的任何特定层面的伪装法则中释放出来。这 种经验的障碍主要是由自我所设置的那些障碍。鲁伯昨晚的那类经验，是这一类 中最简单的一种。</td></tr><tr><td>"More difficult to achieve is an experience in which the ego becomes more alert in self defense.The ego, for example, did not have to worry about Ruburt's physical survival as he lay in bed and "saw" (in quotes) the clock in the other room.When the ego's instinct for self-protection is aroused, then of course it rises up in arms.This is one of the reasons why the experience of levitation is so seldom achieved. "</td><td>有一种经验较难达成，在这种经验中，自我在自我防卫中变得更加警觉。例如， 当鲁伯躺在床上"看到"(加引号)在另一个房间的时钟时间，自我不必担心他身 体的存活问题。当自我的自我保护的本能被激起时，那么当然它会奋力反抗。这 就是为什么悬空漂浮很少被经验的原因之一。</td></tr><tr><td>For one thing levitation as such has little value.However the ego instantly stiffens its control when it feels that any physical law is being disobeyed, because the ego is concerned with your physical universe, and your existence upon your plane is definitely determined by your recognition and obedience to camouflage necessities.</td><td>一方面，悬浮本身没有什么价值。然而，当自我感觉到任何物理法则被违反时， 就会立刻加强它的控制，因为自我关注的是你们的物质宇宙，而你在你们层面上 的存在，绝对是由你对伪装之必要性的认知和服从决定的。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take your break.</td><td>我建议你们休息一下</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:30.Jane was dissociated as usual.She said she felt "real flat" after last break, because she felt that I had withdrawn my support from her; it was as though a great hole opened in the floor, around which she must walk carefully.</td><td>(10:30。珍解离如常。她说，在上次休息之后，她觉得"真的很泄气"，因为她觉 得我不再支持她了；好像地板上开了一个大洞，在洞的周围，她必须小心翼翼地 走着。</td></tr><tr><td>(I then explained that I had felt that she wasn't too interested either, whereupon Jane explained that by her remark about passing out until the end of the session, she meant she would like to be dissociated until its end; while in this state, she said, she did not feel fatigue.Thus she meant she could do a better job in delivering the material I had misinterpreted her.</td><td>(我解释说，我感觉她也不是太感兴趣，于是珍解释说，她说她想待在外面，直到 课程结束的意思是，她希望一直处于解离状态，直到课程结束；她说，在这种状态，她不会感到疲惫。因此，她的意思是，她可以把资料传述得更好，而我误解了她。</td></tr><tr><td>(Her voice was practically normal when she resumed at 10:36.  )</td><td>(10:36 恢复时，声音基本正常)。</td></tr><tr><td>Now this material on inner senses will ultimately be tied into the material on your so-called expanding universe, but there are many connections yet to be made.</td><td>这些关于内在感官的资料，最终会和你们所谓的宇宙膨胀的资料联系起来，但还 有很多联系尚未建立。</td></tr><tr><td>I am not sure precisely which way to give you this material.However we are on firmer ground now.As I mentioned, there is no real expansion of the universe in space.The appearance is a distortion.I have mentioned in the past that everything does have a form or a tissue capsule and field of energy.</td><td>我不确定究竟以何种方式给你们这份资料。不过我们现在有了更坚实的基础。如 我提过的，宇宙在太空中没有真正的膨胀。这种外观是一种扭曲。我之前提过， 万物确实都有一个形态或组织囊以及一个能量场域。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane tapped on my desk for emphasis.)</td><td>(珍拍了拍我的桌子以示强调。)</td></tr><tr><td>These forms vary on different planes, are visible or invisible according to your own situation.A form that may be perceived by you as solid may be perceived merely as an electrical unit in another plane, or as color on a third.You for example have a certain physical form to other inhabitants of your universe.You are perceived by others on other planes at this moment, but to them you are not perceived in the form with which you are familiar.</td><td>这些形态在不同的层面亦有所不同，根据你们自己的情况而可见或不可见。一个 可能被你认为是固体的形态，在另一个层面上，可能仅仅被认为是一个电子单 元，或者在第三个层面上被认为是颜色。例如，你对于你们宇宙的其他居民来 说，具有一定的物质形态。此刻，你被其他层面上的居民所感知，但对他们来 说，你并不是以你所熟悉的形态被感知。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I have said that a plane is not necessarily a location. It is not necessarily a planet, though it may be.The universe as you think of it contains innumerable planes, all taking up in your terms the same amount of space.The forms within these planes are in constant motion, as are the planes themselves.</td><td>现在我已经说过，层面不一定是一个地点，它不一定是一个星球，尽管它可能 是。你们所认为的宇宙包含了无数的层面，用你们的话说，所有的层面都占据了 相同的空间。这些层面内的形态，一直处在动的状态，层面本身也是如此。</td></tr><tr><td>There is a continual exchange of energy and vitality, in other words, of actual atoms and molecules between one plane and another.</td><td>一个层面与另一个层面之间，不断有能量和活力的交换，换句话说，实际的原子 和分子的交换。</td></tr><tr><td>Your universe is only one of many such universes.You are aware only of perceptions along the horizontal planes, and the more powerful your scientific instruments become the more you will be able to see.One universe does become another.However, the universes containing an almost infinite number of planes are therefore affected by the exchange of energies involved, and the interaction and continual movement even of one plane through another results in effects which will be perceived in various ways, again according to your own situation in them.</td><td>你们的宇宙只是众多这样的宇宙中的一个。你们只意识到沿水平层面的感知，你 们的科学仪器越是强大，你们就越能看到。一个宇宙确实会成为另一个宇宙。然 而，包含几乎无限数量层面的宇宙，因此会受到相关能量交换的影响，甚至一个 层面通过另一个层面的相互作用，和持续运动所导致的效应，同样是根据你自己 在其中的情况，而以各种不同的方式被感知。</td></tr><tr><td>These effects will be experienced as necessary distortive boundaries, in some cases resembling a flow as if a plane were surrounded by water, in some cases a charge as of electricity, but on each plane the resulting effects of this interchange, interaction and constant motion of energy will take on the camouflage of the particular plane.</td><td>这些效应将被体验为必要的扭曲边界，在某些情况下类似于一股流动，就像层面 被水包围一样，在某些情况下，类似于充电，像是一种电能，但在每个层面上， 这种能量的交换、相互作用和不断运动所产生的效应，将作用于特定层面的伪装 上。</td></tr><tr><td>Using the senses developed on a particular plane to perceive its characteristic camouflage patterns, it is almost impossible to see beyond these boundary effects.The inner senses are inherently equipped to do this, but for many reasons they do not.The appearance of an expanding universe is also caused therefore by this distortive boundary effect, resulting from the interaction of which I have just spoken.In some cases the distortive effect could be likened to the reflection of a solid tree in water.</td><td>使用在某一特定层面上开发的感官来感知其特有的伪装模式，几乎不可能看到超 出这些边界效应以外的东西。而内在感官本来就有能力做到这一点，但由于许多 原因，它们并没有这样做。因此，宇宙膨胀的外观也是由这种扭曲的边界效应造成的，这是我刚才讲的相互作用造成的。在某些情况下，这种扭曲效应可以比作 一棵坚实的树在水中的倒影。</td></tr><tr><td>The outer senses observing the reflection might try to judge the depth of the water by the height of the tree, supposing it to be as deep as the tree is high.</td><td>观察倒影的外在感官，可能会试图通过树的高度来判断水的深度，认为树有多 高，水就有多深。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take your break.And incidentally, you are getting this material through more clearly than I had hoped.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。顺便说一句，你把这些资料传述得比我希望的更清楚。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:00.Jane was dissociated as usual.We sat in silence for the most part, resting;
