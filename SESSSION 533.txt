<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 532,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第532节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>MAY 27, 1970, 9:24 P.M. WEDNESDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1970年5月27日 星期三 晚上9：24</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Persons vary in the amount of sleep they need, and no pill will ever allow them to dispense with sleep entirely, for too much work is done in that state. However, this could be done far more effectively with two, rather than one, sleep periods of lesser duration.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>每人所需的睡眠量不同，而永远也没有药能让人完全不用睡眠，因为太多的工作都是在那个状态里完成的。不过，在两段较短的睡眠中比在一次睡眠中能做得更有效率。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Two periods of three hours apiece would be quite sufficient for most people, if the proper suggestions were given before sleep ---- suggestions that would insure the body’s complete recuperation. In many cases ten hours sleep, for example, is actually disadvantageous, resulting in a sluggishness both of mind and body. In this case the spirit has simply been away from the body for too long a time, resulting in a loss of muscular flexibility.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果在睡前给自己适当的提示——保证身体完全恢复的建议，两段三小时的睡眠对大多数人来说应该是足够了。在许多情形里，十小时的睡眠实际上反而是不利的，会造成心与身两者的呆滞。在这情形下，灵魂离开身体太过久，结果造成肌肉的失却弹性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane’s delivery was quite fast, and remained so throughout the session.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍的传递相当快，而且整节课都是如此。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As many light snacks would actually be much better than three large meals a day, so short naps rather than such an extended period would also be more effective. There would be other benefits. The conscious self would recall more of its dream adventures as a matter of course, and gradually these would be added to the totality of experience as the ego thinks of it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>就像“少量多餐”的确会比一天三大餐要好得多，因此睡几次短觉也比睡那么长的一觉更有效，而且还有别的好处。有意识的自己自然而然会记得更多它梦中的探险，而渐渐地把这些加入自我所认为的全盘经验中。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As a result of more frequent, briefer sleep periods, there would also be higher peaks of conscious focus, and a more steady renewal of both physical and psychic activity. There would not be such a definite division between the various areas or levels of the self. A more economical use of energy would result, and also a more effective use of nutrients. Consciousness as you know it would also become more flexible and mobile.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>较多、较短的睡眠，结果使有意识的聚焦达到更高的顶峰，并且身心活动都有更稳定的更新。在“自己”的各区域或各层面间比较没有那么确定的分界。结果会造成精力更经济的利用，和养分更有效的利用。你所知道的意识也会变得更有弹性、更有活动力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This would not lead to a blurring of consciousness or focus. Instead the greater flexibility would result in a perfection of conscious focus. The seeming great division between the waking and the sleeping self is largely a result of the division in function, the two being largely separated ---- a block of time being allotted to the one, and a larger block of time to the other. They are kept apart, then, because of your use of time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这不会导致意识或焦点的模糊。相反的，更大的弹性会使有意识的聚焦趋于完美。在醒时与睡时的“自己”之间看起来有很大的隔阂，主要是分工的结果，两者被分得很开——分给了其中一个一大段时间，而分给另一个更大段的时间。那么，它们是因为你对时间的应用而被隔开的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:36.) Initially, your conscious life followed the light of day. Now with artificial light this need not be the case. There are opportunities here, then, to be gained from your technology that you are not presently taking advantage of. To sleep all day and work all night is hardly the answer; it is simply the inversion of your present habits. But it would be far more effective and efficient to divide the twenty-four-hour period in a different way.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:36)本来，你们是“日出而作，日入而息”的。现在有了人工光就不必如此了。于是你就可以从你们的技术得到你目前没加以利用的机会。整天睡觉、整夜工作却并非答案，那只是把你目前的习惯颠倒过来而已。但如果以不同的方式来划分二十四小时，会更有效果、更有效率。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are many variations, in fact, that would be better than your present system. Ideally, sleeping five hours at a time, you gain the maximum benefit, and anything else over this time is not nearly as helpful. Those who require more sleep would then take, say, a two-hour nap. For others a four-hour block sleep session and two naps would be highly beneficial. With suggestion properly given, the body can recuperate in half the time now given to sleep. In any case it is much more bracing and efficient to have the physical body active rather than inactive for, say, eight to ten hours.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>事实上，有许多种不同的办法都比你们目前的要好。理想上说，一次睡五小时可获得最大的利益，比这再多的时间就没有这么管用了。那么那些需要更多睡眠的人，可以有个两小时的小睡。对其他人则一次四小时的睡眠和两次小睡会极为有利。给了身体正确的提示，身体只要花现在一半的睡眠时间就能恢复。无论如何，活动八到十小时比不动八到十小时能使身体振作和有效率得多。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You have trained your consciousness to follow certain patterns that are not necessarily natural for it, and these patterns increase the sense of alienation between the waking and dreaming self. To some extent you drug the body with suggestion, so that it believes it must sleep away a certain amount of hours in one block. Animals sleep when they are tired, and awaken in a much more natural fashion.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你已训练你的意识去遵循某些对它而言不一定是自然的模式，这些模式增强了醒时自己与睡时自己之间的陌生感。你到某程度以“暗示”迷倒了身体，使它相信它必须一次睡足多少个小时。其他动物则累了就睡，而以自然得多的方式醒过来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You would retain a far greater memory of your subjective experiences, and your body would be healthier, if these sleeping patterns were changed. Six to eight hours of sleep in all would be sufficient with the nap patterns outlined. And even those who think they now need more sleep than this would find that they did not, if all the time was not spent in one block. The entire system, physical, mental, and psychic, would benefit.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果改变这些睡眠模式，你会保留更多对你的主观经验的记忆，你的身体会更健康。照所订的小睡模式，一共睡六到八小时就够了。如果不是一次睡太长的话，即使那些现在以为他们需要更多睡眠的人，都会发现他们其实并不需要。全部系统，肉体的、精神的与心灵的，都会获益。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The divisions between the self would not be nearly as severe. Physical and mental work would be easier, and the body itself would gain steady periods of refreshment and rest. Now, as a rule, it must wait, regardless of its condition, at least for some sixteen hours. For other reasons having to do with the chemical reactions during the dream state, bodily health would be improved; and this particular schedule would also be of help in schizophrenia, and generally aid persons with problems of depression, or those withmental instability.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>自己之间的分界就不会那么严格，肉体与精神的工作会轻松些，而身体本身有固定的时间能获得休息与更新。不像现在，不管身体的情况如何，它都必须至少等上十六个小时左右，才有得休息。因其他与在作梦状态中的化学反应有关的理由，改变睡眠模式后，身体的健康也会改进。这特定的时间表对患精神分裂症的人会有帮助，一般而言，对有沮丧问题的人或那些精神不安定的人也有帮助。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:52.) Your sense of time would also be less rigorous and rigid. Creative abilities would be quickened, and the great problem of insomnia that exists for many people would be largely conquered ---- for what they fear is often the long period of time in which consciousness, as they think of it, seems to be extinguished.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:52)你的时间观念也会比较不那么强烈和死板。创造能力会加快，许多人都有的失眠问题也大半会克服——因为他们害怕的常是在那段长时间里，他们所认为的意识似乎被消灭了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Small meals or snacks would then be taken upon rising. This method of eating and sleeping would greatly help various metabolic difficulties, and also aid in the development of spiritual and psychic ability. For many reasons, physical activity at night has a different effect upon the body than physical activity during the day, and ideally, both effects are necessary.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>睡眠起来时应吃一小餐或点心。这种进食和睡眠的方法会大大改善各种新陈代谢的毛病，也有助于精神与心灵能力的发展。因许多理由，晚上的身体活动与白天的身体活动，对身体有不同的影响，理想上说，两种影响都需要。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>At certain times during the night the negative ions in the air are much stronger, or numerous, than in the daytime, for example; and activity during this time, particularly a walk or outside activity, would be highly beneficial from a health standpoint.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如，在夜间的某些时候，空气中的负离子比在白天强得多或多得多；在那段时间的活动，尤其是散步或户外活动，从健康的观点上是极为有益的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now the period just before dawn often represents a crisis point for persons severely ill. Consciousness has been away from the body for too long a period, and such a returning consciousness then has difficulty dealing with the sick body mechanism. The practice in hospitals of giving drugs to patients so that they will sleep entirely throughout the night is detrimental for this reason. In many cases it is too great a strain on the part of the returning consciousness to take over again the ailing mechanism.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>黎明前的一刻对重病的人常常代表一个危险期。意识已离开身体太久，于是当它回来时不容易应付有病的身体机制。为此之故，医院给病人药物使他们睡过整夜的做法是有害的。在许多情形，对一个回来的意识来说，要再一次地接收病体是太大的重担。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Such medications also often prevent certain necessary dream cycles that can help the body recuperate, and the consciousness then becomes highly disoriented. Some of the divisions between different portions of the self, therefore, are not basically necessary but are the result of custom and convenience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这种药物也常阻止了能助身体复原某些必要的“作梦周期”，于是意识变得非常的迷惑。所以，在自己的不同部分之间的分界，有些基本上是不必要的，却只是习俗与方便的结果。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In earlier periods of time, even though there were no electric lights for example, sleep was not long and continuous at night, for sleeping quarters were not as secure. The caveman, for example, while sleeping was on the alert for predators. The mysterious aspects of the natural night in outside surroundings kept him partially alert. He awakened often, and surveyed the nearby land and his own place of shelter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如在较早的时期，虽然没有电灯，在夜间睡眠也并不是长而持续的，因为睡觉的地方并不像现在那样安全，例如，穴居人在睡眠中仍保持对掠食者的警觉。在外界环境里，自然的夜晚种种神秘面貌使他保持部分警醒的状况。他常常醒过来，查看附近的地方和他自己的避难所。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:04.) He did not sleep in long blocks as you do. His sleeping periods were instead for two or three hours, stretched through the nighttime from dusk to dawn, but alternated by periods of high wakefulness and alert activity. He also crept out to seek food when he hoped his predators were sleeping.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:04)他不像你们一样睡上长长的一段时间。相反的，由黄昏到黎明的整个时间内，他的睡眠分成两、三小时的段落，中间穿插着极清醒与警觉的活动时间。当他冀望他的掠食者正在睡的时候，他也潜行出去找食物。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This resulted in a mobility of consciousness that indeed insured his physical survival, and those intuitions that appeared to him in the dream state were remembered and taken advantage of in the waking state.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这导致了意识的机动性，的确进而保证了他肉体的幸存，他也记得那些在他梦中出现的直觉，而在清醒时加以利用。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, many diseases are simply caused by this division of yours and this long period of bodily inactivity, and this extended focus of attention in either waking or dreaming reality. Your normal consciousness can benefit by excursions and rest in those other fields of actuality that are entered when you sleep, and the so-called sleeping consciousness will also benefit by frequent excursions into the waking state.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>许多疾病其实就是由于你们的这种分界、身体长时间的不活动，和注意力的焦点放在清醒时的实相或梦中实相太久的关系。你正常的意识，能因那些你睡时到其他真实场所的出游与休息而受益，所谓睡眠的意识，也会由经常到清醒状态中游历而受益。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:10. Jane’s trance had been deep, her pace fast throughout. Yet she remembered some of the material, which usually isn’t the case. She hadn’t been reading about sleep recently. “The whole bit is far out to me,” she said. “I haven’t been entertaining any ideas like these, at least consciously.” Resume in the same manner at 10:22.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:10。珍的出神状态很深，她的步调一直很快。不过她却例外的记得一些资料，她近来并没阅读关于睡眠的书。她说“整个东西对我来说是太玄了！我从没有思考过这样的概念，至少不是有意识的。”在12:12以同样的方式继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: I bring up these matter here because such changes in habitual patterns would definitely result in greater understanding of the nature of the self. The inner dreaming portions of the personality seem strange to you not only because of a basic difference of focus, but because you clearly devote opposite portions of a twenty-four hour cycle to these areas of the self.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我在这儿谈到这些事情，因为这种习惯性模式的改变，一定会导致对自己本质的更大了解。人格内在作梦的部分在你看来似乎很奇怪、很陌生，不只因为基本上焦点的不同，而且因为你清楚地把一个二十四小时周期的相反部分，分给自己的这些不同区域。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You separate them as much as possible. In doing so you divide your intuitive, creative, and psychic abilities quite neatly from your physical, manipulative, objective abilities. It makes no difference how many hours of sleep you think you need. You would be much better off sleeping in several shorter periods, and you would actually then require less time. The largest sleep unit should be at night. But again, the efficiency of sleep is lessened and disadvantages set in after six to eight hours of physical inactivity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你尽量的分开它们。在这样做时你把直觉的、创造的和心灵的能力，十分清爽地与你肉体的、操纵的、客观的能力分开。你认为你需要多少小时的睡眠并没有关系。睡几个短些的觉则对你要好得多，而那时你确实只需要较少的时间。最大的睡眠单位应在夜晚。但我再说一次，在六到八小时肉体的不活动之后，睡眠的效率减低，而害处也开始了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The functions of hormones and chemicals, and of adrenal processes in particular, would function with far greater effectiveness with these alternating periods of activities as I have mentioned. The wear and tear upon the body would be minimized, while at the same time all regenerative powers would be used to the maximum. Both those with a high and low metabolism would benefit.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>以我所说的这种交替的活动段落，荷尔蒙和化学的作用，尤其是肾上腺素的制造，会作用得有效得多。身体的损耗会减低，而同时所有的重生力量会用到极限。新陈代谢快与慢的人均将受益。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The psychic centers would be activated more frequently, and the entire identity of the personality would be better strengthened and maintained. The resulting mobility and flexibility of consciousness would cause an added dividend in increased conscious concentration, and fatigue levels would always remain below danger points. A greater equalization, both physical and mental, would result.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>心灵的中心会更常常被发动，而人格的整个本体会更加强而维护得更好。结果意识的机动性与弹性会更加助长意识的集中，疲乏的水准会永远维持在低于危险点。结果身心双方都更平衡。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now such schedules could be adopted quite easily. Those who work the American working hours, for example, could sleep between four to six hours an evening, according to individual variations, and nap after supper. I want to make it plain, however, that anything over a six- to eight-hour continuous sleeping period works against you, and a ten-hour period for example can be quite disadvantageous. On awakening often then you do not feel rested, but drained of energy. You have not been minding the store.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>其实很容易采用这种时间表。例如，那些按美国工作时间做事的人可以在夜间睡四到六小时——随个人的不同，而在晚餐后小睡。不过，我要说明白，任何超过六到八小时的连续睡眠都于你不利，至于十小时的睡眠则可能为害不浅了。那时当你醒过来，你并不觉得休息充分，却觉得精力耗光了。你没有好好照顾你的铺子。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If you do not understand that in periods of sleep your consciousness actually does leave your body, then what I have said will be meaningless. Now your consciousness does return at times, to check upon the physical mechanisms, and the simple consciousness of atom and cell ---- the body consciousness ---- is always with the body, so it is not vacant. But the largely creative portions of the self do leave the body, and for large periods of time when you sleep.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你不了解在睡眠期间，你的意识确实真的会离开你的身体，那我所说的就毫无意义。你的意识的确有时会回来查一查肉体机制，而原子与细胞的简单意识——身体意识——总是与身体在一起，因此身体不是个空壳子，但当你睡着时，自己主要具创造力的部分真的离开了身体，而且离开一大段时间。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:39.) Some cases of strong neurotic behavior result from your present sleeping habits. Sleepwalking to some degree is also connected here. Consciousness wants to return to the body, but it has been hypnotized into the idea that the body must not awaken. Excess nervous energy takes over, and rouses the muscles to activity, because the body knows it has been inactive for too long and otherwise severe muscular cramps would result.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:39)由你们目前的睡眠习惯，导致了一些强烈的神经质行为的例子。梦游症在某程度也与此相关。意识想回到身体，但它已被催眠而相信不可惊醒身体。过剩的神经能量接管了，而唤起了肌肉活动，因为身体知道它已经太久不动了，再下去的话会导致严重的肌肉痉挛。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The same applies to your eating habits. By turn you overstuff and then starve the tissues. This has definite effects upon the nature of your consciousness, your creativity, your degree of concentration. Along these lines, for example, you do literally starve your bodies at night, and add to the aging of your bodies by denying them food throughout those long hours. All of this reflects upon the strength and nature of your consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>同样的例子适用于你的饮食习惯。你把身体的组织一下撑饱一下又饿坏。这对你意识的本质、你的创造力、你精神的集中程度都有明确的影响。例如，照着这个方向，你在夜间真的把你的身体饿死，而由于这么长的时间都不给身体食物，乃增加了它的老化。所有这些都反映在你意识的力量与本质上。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Your food should be divided within the twenty-four hour period, and not just during the times of wakefulness ---- that is, if the sleep patterns were changed as I suggest, you would also be eating during some night hours. You would eat far less at any given “mealtime,” however. Small amounts of food much more frequently taken would be much more beneficial than your present practice in physical, mental, and psychic terms.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你的食物应分配在二十四小时内，而并非只在醒来的时候——也就是说，如果睡眠模式照我所建议的改变了，你在某些夜间时间也会吃些东西。可是，在任一 “进餐时间”你会吃得少得多。少量多餐比你现在的做法，在身体、精神和心灵上都有益得多。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Changing the sleep patterns would automatically change the eating patterns. You would find you were a much more united identity. You would become aware of your clairvoyant and telepathic abilities, for example, to a far greater degree, and you would not feel the deep separation that you now feel between the dreaming and waking self. To a large degree this sense of alienation would vanish.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>改变睡眠模式会自动改变饮食模式，你会发现你是一个更为统一的本体。例如，你对你的千里眼和他心通等能力的觉察程度也会大得多，而你不会像现在一样，觉得在作梦的自己与清醒的自己之间有条鸿沟。这种疏离感会消失大半。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Your enjoyment of nature would also increase, for as a rule you are largely unacquainted with the nighttime. You could take much better advantage of the intuitional knowledge that occurs in the dream state, and the cycle of your moods would not swing so definitely as it often does. You would feel much safer and more secure in all areas of existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你对大自然的欣赏也会增加，因为一般而言，你对夜间多半不熟悉。你对梦中发生的直觉知识能利用得好得多，而你的情绪周期也不会像现在那样明显的摇摆。在生存的所有领域，你都会觉得安全得多。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The problems of senility would also be reduced, for stimuli would not be minimized for so long a time. And consciousness, with a greater flexibility, would know more of its own sense of joy.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>老化的问题也会减少，因为刺激不会这么长时间地并减低到最少。而有了更大弹性的意识，会更尝到它自己的喜悦感。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take a break. (Suddenly louder): And if you do not try this, how can you expect others to?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一下。(突然较大声地：)如果你自己都不去尝试，你怎能期望别人去做呢？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jokingly: “I don’t know.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(玩笑地：“我也不知道。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Your own periods of creative work would also be more effective and efficient if you followed the advice given here.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你照这儿所给的劝告去做，你自己的创作也会更有效率。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Well, we’ll see what we can do.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好吧，我们会试试看能做到多少。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:53 P.M. Jane’s trance had again been deep, her pace rapid. Indeed, her speed left my writing hand almost numb. This break proved to be the end of the recorded session.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:53。珍的出神状态又是很深，她的步调很快。说真的，她的速度使我写字写得手都要僵了。这次休息结果是有记录的课的结束。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Now, for the second time recently, Seth and I enjoyed a chat without my taking notes. He explained in more detail how an altered sleep pattern would considerably improve my painting. After it was over I wished I had recorded the conversation, since it contained much information that could be applied generally. Jane ended the evening by saying she “wasn’t even in a session mood tonight.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(现在，赛斯和我享受一个不作笔录的闲谈，这是近来的第二次。他更详细地解释改变了的睡眠模式为何会大大改进我的绘画。在说完之后，我真希望我曾把这对话记录下来，因为它包含了许多一般都适用的资料。珍说她“今晚根本没上课的情绪。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Since this session ---- it is June 1 as I type this ---- Jane and I have been experimenting somewhat with altered sleep patterns, and we can say that Seth’s ideas seem eminently workable. After a shorter nighttime sleep period, we have no difficulty waking up easily, alert and ready to go. We supplement this pattern with one or two rest periods during the daylight hours. The system adds an unaccustomed sharpness of appreciation to all of our activities.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(自这节后——我在6月1日打下这段——珍和我多少实验过改变睡眠模式，我们可以说赛斯的概念似乎大有可为。晚上在较短的睡眠之后，我们很容易就醒过来，很清醒并且抖擞待发。我们以日间一到两次的休息作为补充。这种方法使我们对所有活动都增加了一种不同凡响的敏锐感受。)</a>
