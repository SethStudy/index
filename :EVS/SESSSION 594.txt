<a id=1 href=1>第593节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>AUGUST 30, 1971, 9:06 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年8月30日 星期一 晚上9：06</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The regularly scheduled session for Wednesday, August 25 was not held.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(8月25日周三的定期课没有举行。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(This material came after the second break in this session. First we received several pages about a very interesting development in Jane’s psychic faculties: her growing ability to perceive a beneficial “helper,” as she has taken to calling it…. There is much to be learned here.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(这份资料是在此节的第二次休息后来到。首先我们收到的几页是关乎珍的心灵能力的一个非常有趣的发展：她越来越能感知一位有益的“助手”——她喜欢这样称它——的能力……在此有许多可学的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Earlier in the week Jane received word that her editor wanted an Introduction from her for Seth’s book, and an Appendix. She wondered if the 592nd session would be suitable, and I told her that I thought Seth had planned it that way. She was surprised, then agreed. We decided to leave it entirely up to Seth to produce whatever material he wanted for the Appendix.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(本周之初珍收到她编辑的信，要她为赛斯书写个序及一个附录。她在想不知第592节是否合适，我告诉她，我认为赛斯正是那样计划的，她先是很惊讶，然后就同意了。我们决定完全让赛斯来决定要为附录制作什么资料。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane’s pace as she continued this session at 10:30 was quite fast, animated and emphatic.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(当珍在10:30继续这节时，她的步调相当快，活泼而加强语气的。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: For our Appendix.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，写我们的附录。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The great religions of the world all had their births near the major coordination points. (See Chapter Five.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>世界上所有伟大的宗教都诞生于主要的“交会点”附近(见第五章)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In such localities, changes are apt to appear rapidly, for ideas and emotions are propelled into physical actuality with great vigor. ideas sweep like fire among the people. The psychic atmosphere is fertile.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这种位置，种种改变都有出现得很快的倾向，因为以很大的活力，概念和情感被推进成为具体的实现。概念像野火一样地横扫人群。心灵的气氛丰饶如沃土。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Creativity springs forth easily, and so such locations are not necessarily peaceful, although they would be the best ground in which peace could grow. Any ideas for good or bad become materialized with such strength, however, that the contradictory feelings of mankind are more apparent near coordination points.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>创造力从这儿轻易地涌出，因而这种位置并不一定是平静的，虽然它们应是“和平”可以成长的最好土地。然而，任何或善或恶的概念都这样强力的变成具体化，以致靠近“交会点”的地方，人类的矛盾感受更是明显。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are effects, not as yet ascertained by your scientists, that appear in such areas: effects that were known however at the time of Atlantis, and also utilized by the Lumanians. In a strange manner, space puckers to an unobservable degree, as far as your instruments are concerned, near these coordination points.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些尚未被你们的科学家所确定的效应，发生在这种地区；这些效应在亚特兰蒂斯时期却为人所已知了，也曾被鲁曼尼亚人所利用。就你们的仪器而论，靠近这些交会点，“空间”以一种奇异的方式，皱缩了一个观察不到的程度。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Some of my readers may be familiar with “black” and “white holes” in space, that your scientists have recently discovered.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我曾有些读者也许熟习你们的科学家最近发现太空中的“黑洞”与“白洞”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Some theoretical physicists have postulated recently that when the nuclear fires of very massive stars are finally extinguished, their enormous gravity causes them to collapse so completely that they literally squeeze themselves out of existence. A “black hole” is thus left in space, and surrounding matter can disappear into this.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(有些理论派的物理学家近来曾假定，当一个非常巨大星球的核心火焰终于熄灭时，它们巨大的地心引力会导致它们如此完全地崩塌，以致它们真能把自己挤出于存在之外。一个“黑洞”于是乎被留在太空里，而周围的物质也可能消失到它里面去。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(It’s been further suggested that this vanishing matter can show up elsewhere, either in our universe or others, through “white holes.” There would be a flow of matter in our universe and also between universes, keeping things in balance.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(科学家更进一步的提出，经由“白洞”，这些正在消失的物质能在别的地方出现，在我们的或在其他的宇宙里。在我们的宇宙里，并且宇宙和宇宙之间都有一种“物质的周转”，以保持平衡。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>These points have somewhat the same qualities. The electromagnetic aspects of thoughts and feelings, the animations, are drawn through points that can compare to miniature black holes. Here their energy momentarily disappears from your system, is immeasurably accelerated, however, and returned through what you might call a miniature white hole ---- concentrated now, and highly directed back into your system of reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这些点的性质多少有点相似。思想与情感的电磁特性——其生气——被吸过这可比之为迷你——黑洞的交会点，而它们的能量暂时由你们的系统消失，然而，却被无限地加速，而又由你可谓之为迷你白洞里回来——现在是经过浓缩而非常准确的被导回到你们的实相系统里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This is only an analogy, but for working purposes it is a fair enough one. There is, again, a wrinkling effect about these points, though not as yet observable to you, where space itself, it seems, yearns to disappear inside the first point. There are other distortions in physical laws. A few of these have been observed, but ignored as pertinent signs. (With gestures, eyes wide open): The activities of atoms and molecules quicken as they approach these points, but the distance between the atoms and molecules remains the same. That is important.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这只是个比喻，但为了实用的目的是个不错的比喻。再说一次，虽然对你们而言尚不可观察到，在这些点周围有一种皱缩的效应，在那儿，看起来好像空间本身渴望消失到这一点里面。物理定律在这儿还有其他的扭曲。已有几件被观察到，但却被视为贴切的讯号而忽略过去。(眼睛大睁，边打手势。)原子与分子在接近这些点时活动会加快，但在原子与分子之间的距离却保持不变。那一点是很重要的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:45.) These coordination points also serve to give your system additional sources of energy. The law of entropy does not apply, therefore. The coordination points are actually, then, sources of additional energy. They only open however when concentrations of energy build up within your system. I would like to make the idea clearer. A physical vehicle, a spaceship, for example, could never survive that kind of exit and reentry from your system.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:45停顿。)这些交会点也有给你们的系统额外能源的功用。因此，熵(entropy)不适用。那么，交会点实际上是额外的能量来源。无论如何，只有当浓缩的能量在你们的系统里累积起来时，它们才开放。我想把这概念弄得更清楚些。一个物质性的交通工具，好比说一艘太空船，绝对不能经过交会点进出于你们系统而幸存。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause at 10:50. Jane’s delivery had been very animated.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:50停顿很久。珍的传递一直非常活泼。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(A note: The second law of thermodynamics tells us that while the total energy in a closed system such as our universe remains constant, the amount of energy available for useful work is constantly decreasing. A mathematical factor that measures the unavailable energy is called entropy. Seth has insisted from the very beginning of our sessions that the law of entropy doesn’t apply, and that there are no closed systems.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(注：热力学第二定律告诉我们，虽然在一个像我们宇宙这样的封闭系统里，能量的总和维持不变，能用来做功的能量则经常在减少中。测量这不能用的能量有一个数学因子就叫作“熵”。赛斯从我们课的最开头时就坚持熵定律并不适用，而且并没有封闭的系统。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In Atlantis there were those who utilized this knowledge, accelerating certain thoughts through concentration, emphasizing certain feelings so as to send them through these coordination points. Great stability was therefore achieved as far as roads, buildings, and the like were concerned. Such projects were carried out with great consideration for their position between various coordination points.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在亚特兰蒂斯时代，有人利用这知识，经由集中而把某些思想加速，强调某些情感，再把它们由这些交会点送出去。因此就道路、建筑及这类东西来说，达成了很大的稳定性。这种计划是在对它们在各交会点间的位置经过周详考虑后才进行的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This pocketing-of-space effect can be perceived in certain trance states.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在某种出神状态中，可以感知这种“空间口袋效应”(pocketing-of-space effect)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Can Ruburt do this?”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“鲁柏能做这个吗？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I didn’t think Seth heard me; there was a burst of traffic noise through our open living room window just as I asked the question. The answer came easily, though.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我不认为赛斯听到了我；正当我问这问题的时候，我们开着的客厅窗外突然透进一阵交通的噪音。然而，回答来得倒容易。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This can be compared almost to a wadding-up of air.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这几乎可以比作是空气纸团(a wadding-up of air)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now sit quietly with your eyes closed and try to ascertain the directional proximity of main or subordinate coordination points. Here are some aids to help you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在闭上眼安静地坐着，试着确定主要或次要交会点的最近似的方向。这儿有些对你有帮助的要领。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>With the intent in mind, you will find your inner vision inclining toward a particular direction of the room, and even your thoughts will seem to follow in the same direction. An imaginary line will help you properly identify the place, in any given location, closest to any given coordination point. Imagine a line drawn from the point of your inner vision, coming from the inner eye you seem to be using, outward. Let it be joined by an imaginary line from the top of your skull, following the same direction in which your thoughts seem to flow.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>心中怀着这个目的，你会发现你的内在视觉会朝向室中某一特定方向，甚至于你的思想似乎也随着那同样的方向。一条想象的线会帮助你在任一特定位置，正确地认出最接近任一特定交会点的地方。想象从你的内在视觉点向外拉出一条线，它来自你似乎在用的内在心眼。让这条线与随着你的思想仿佛流向的方向而由你头顶出来一条想象的线相交。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You have an imaginary line, then, in this case, from here, and here. There is an angle, and then both lines form together. They will point unerringly to the direction closest to a coordination point.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>于是，在这情形，由这儿与这儿，你有一条想象的线。有一个角度，然后两线相交。它们将无误地指向最接近一个交会点的方向。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(To illustrate this as she spoke for Seth, Jane touched her eyes with one hand and the top of her head with the other. She extended her hands from these points until they met at arm’s length, somewhat off to her right. I sat roughly south of Jane as she faced me, so this meant she indicated the western corner of our living room.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍为赛斯说话时，为了说明这个，她以一手触眼，以另一手触头顶。她从这些点伸展她的手，直到它们在一臂之长的地方相会，略为偏向她的右方。当她面对我坐着时，我大致坐在她的南方，因此这指她指出我们客厅西边的角落。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The subordinate points permeate space. Ruburt will be able to tell you, for example, the nearest point in this room. Sometimes the angle will be longer, but the two lines will point in the right direction. Energy is, therefore, most effective in those areas.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>次要的交会点则弥漫了空间。例如，鲁柏将能告诉你在这屋里最近的一个交会点，有时这角度会较长，但这两条线将指向对的方向。因此，能量在那些区域最有效。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause.) Now you may take a break or end the session as you prefer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(停顿很久。)现在你可以休息一下，或结束此节，随你的便。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“We’ll take a break.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我们休息一下。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:02. Jane was quiet after coming out of a deep trance. I wondered aloud where the nearest coordination point was. This brought forth a torrent of information from her ---- she’d forgotten it until my remark reminded her of what had happened.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:02。在由一深沉的出神状态出来后，珍很安静。我大声的说不知最近的交会点是在哪里。这才由她那儿引出滔滔不绝的资讯——她已忘了它，直到我说的话提醒了她刚才发生的事。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane said that while speaking for Seth, she knew the two lines she was indicating met in the west-by-south corner of our room. She walked over to the spot most positively. It was just inside the wall, between two of our bay windows and in back of an old-fashioned, exposed steam pipe. Unfortunately it was crowded between a heater and bookcase, and wasn’t a spot we could put into easy use.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍说在为赛斯说话时，她知道她所指明的两线在我们房间的西偏南角交会。她极断然地走到那一点去。它刚巧在我们的两个凸窗之间的墙内，在一个老式的、暴露的蒸气管后面。很可惜它挤在一个暖气设备与书架之间，不是个容易加以利用的地点。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Walking about the room, Jane said she felt her thoughts “lean” in just that direction. Now that she knew where the coordination point was, it seemed incredible to her that she hadn’t always known its location. She couldn’t possibly lean mentally in any other direction, she said. She turned her back to the spot, and gleefully announced that she felt the “lines” go out to it from the back of her head. Resume at 11:10.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍在屋内走来走去，说她觉得她的思想就只“偏向”那个方向。现在她已知交会点何在，她觉得不能想象她没有一向都知道它的位置。她说她不可能在精神上偏向于任何其他的方向。她背对着那点，快活地宣称她感觉那“两条线”由她脑后向那点延伸出去。在11:10继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Using this analogy of the white hole and the black hole: To make this clearer, the white hole is within the black hole. Do you follow me?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>再用这黑洞与白洞的比喻：说得更清楚一点，白洞就在黑洞之内。你听懂了吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“懂了。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Electromagnetic properties are drawn into the black hole, and accelerated beyond imagination. The acceleration and the activities within the black hole draw unbelievable proportions (I checked this word with Seth) of additional energy from other systems.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>电磁的特性被吸进黑洞，而加速到超乎想象的程度，在黑洞之内的加速与活动由其他系统吸进了不可置信比例(我跟赛斯核对过这个字)的额外能量。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This greater acceleration changes the very nature of the units involved. In the meantime, the characteristics of the black hole itself are changed by this activity. A black hole is a white hole turned inside out, in other words. The electromagnetic “matter” may reemerge through the same “hole” or “point” which is now a white hole.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这更大的加速就改变了所涉及单位的本质。同时，黑洞本身的特性也被这活动所改变。换言之，黑洞是个反过来的白洞。电磁的“物质”可以由同样的“洞”或“点”——现在成了白洞——再出现。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The reemergence, however, again alters its characteristics. It becomes “hungry” once more, and again, a black hole. The same sort of activity goes on in all systems. The holes, therefore, or coordination points, are actually great accelerators that reenergize energy itself.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，这再出现又再次地改变了它的特性。它又再度变得“饿”了，而又成了“黑洞”。同类的这种活动在所有的系统里进行。因此，这些洞，或交会点，实际上是了不起的加速器，将能量本身重赋活力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will end this material for this evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们将结束今晚的这个资料。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(An abrupt ending, then, after a long pause. But Seth returned):</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(于是，在停顿了很久之后，突然就结束。但赛斯又回来了。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Put a note after the material on coordination points, indicating the Appendix. This is not our book (humorously), this is the Appendix to our book.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在交会点的资料后面加一个注，指明是附录。这不是我们的书(幽默地)，这是我们书的附录。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Okay.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>My heartiest good wishes to you and a fond good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>对你们最衷心的祝福，晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Thank you very much, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯，非常感谢你。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>And when you find time for the recorder, I will find time for you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当你有时间录音时，我也会腾出时间给你。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“All right. Good night, now.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的，现在晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:21 P.M. After the session, Jane tried Seth’s method for finding coordination points once more. Again she found herself pointing to the west-by-south corner of the room. “I got a whole bunch of stuff that time,” she said, meaning that she received some extra information after trance. “Those lines form triangular or flue shapes that contain energy. That’s why psychics talk about pyramid forms ---- those lines keep the energy concentrated.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:21。在课后，珍再试赛斯找交会点的方法。她又再一次发现自己指向屋子的西偏南角。她说：“那次我得到一大堆东西。”意指她在出神状态之后收到一些额外的资讯。“那些线形成三角形的或通气管的形状，里面含有能量。那就是为什么通灵者谈到金字塔形状——那些线使能量集中。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Sure; that’s why I get the triangle effect with Seth Two,” she exclaimed. “Only when I’m in a Seth Two trance, the coordination point is in a different direction. It goes up from the top of my head, way out of the room and the house into a different reality.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(她喊道：“没错，那就是和赛斯二接触时，我为何获得三角形效应的理由。只不过当我在一个‘赛斯二的出神状态’里的时候，交会点是在一个不同的方向，它由我的头顶上出去，远离了这房间与房子，进入一个不同的实相。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane then thought of having the members of her ESP class try Seth’s method. She wanted to see if they would locate the same spot that she had.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍于是想到让她的ESP班学员试赛斯的方法。她想看看他们是否会指出与她相同的点。)</a>
