<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 591,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第591节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>AUGUST 11, 1971, 9:03 P.M. WEDNESDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年8月11日 星期三 晚上9：02</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Again, this was a short session. Jane and I had grown very used to living with Seth’s production of his book; we had come to look forward to each development. But now… “I almost don’t want to hold the session,” Jane said as we waited for 9:00. “It’s a real funny feeling ---- almost nostalgic. I can feel ---- I know ---- that Seth’s going to end his book soon now, probably tonight, and I don’t want it to happen, I guess.” She’d mentioned such feelings occasionally before, since Seth began work on the last two chapters.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(这又是一节短课，珍和我已变得非常习惯与赛斯书的制作一同生活；我们已变得期待着每一个发展。但现在……在我们等着到九点钟时，珍说“我几乎不想上这一课了，我真的觉得怪怪的——几乎是依恋的。我能感觉到——我知道——赛斯现在很快就要结束他的书了，也许在今晚，我猜我不想让它发生。”自赛斯开始最后两章的工作后，她也曾偶尔提起这种感觉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will resume dictation. (Now Jane’s pace was rather fast, her voice quiet.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们继续口述。(现在珍的步调颇快，她的声音很安静。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I titled this chapter “A Goodbye and an Introduction.” The good-bye is my own, since I am now finishing this book. The introduction applies to each reader, for I hope that you will now be able to meet yourself face to face with a greater understanding of who and what you are.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我称这章为(辞别和引介)。辞别是我自己对你们说的，因我现在正在结束此书。“引介”则对每个读者都适用，因为我希望你们现在能够怀有对“自己是谁”与“自己是什么”的更大了解来面对你自己。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I would like, therefore, to introduce you to yourself.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，我想把你们引介给你们自己。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You will not find yourself by running from teacher to teacher, from book to book. You will not meet yourself through following any particular specialized method of meditation. Only by looking quietly within the self that you know can your own reality be experienced, with those connections that exist between the present or immediate self and the inner identity that is multidimensional.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你们无法借由遍访名师或博览群书来找到自己。借由追随任何特定的专门化冥想方法，你们也不会见到你们自己。只有由安静地内观你所知的自己，你才能体验到你自己的实相，以及那存在于这当下切身的自己，和那多次元的“内在本体”间的那些关联。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There must be a willingness, an acquiescence, a desire. If you do not take the time to examine your own subjective states, then you cannot complain if so many answers seem to elude you. You cannot throw the burden of proof upon another, or expect a man or teacher to prove to you the validity of your own existence. Such a procedure is bound to lead you into one subjective trap after another.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>一定要有一种意愿、一种默许、一种欲望。如果你不花时间去检查你自己的主观状态，那么如果这么多答案仿佛都躲着你，你也无法抱怨。你不能把“举证责任”丢给别人，或期待一个人或老师对你证明你自己存在的合法性，这样的一个过程必然会引你落入一个又一个的主观陷阱。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As you sit reading this book, the doorways within are open. You have only to experience the moment as you know it as fully as possible ---- as it exists physically within the room, or outside in the streets of the city in which you live. Imagine the experience present in one moment of time over the globe, then try to appreciate the subjective experience of your own that exists in the moment and yet escapes it ---- and this multiplied by each living individual.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当你坐着读此书时，你内在的门户是开放的。你只要尽可能完全地体验你所知的这片刻——如它具体存在于这房中的样子，或存在于外面你所住城市街道上的样子。想象在这一刻时间里临在于全地球的经验，然后试着欣赏，那存在于这一刻却逃开了这一刻的，你自己的主观经验——把这个再乘以每一个活着的个人。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This exercise alone will open your perceptions, increase your awareness and automatically expand your appreciation of your own nature.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>光是这个练习就会打开你的感知力，增加你的知觉而自动地扩展你对自己天性的欣赏。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The “you” who is capable of such expansion must be a far more creative and multidimensional personality than you earlier imagined. Many of the suggested small exercises given earlier in the book will also help you become acquainted with your own reality, will give you direct experience with the nature of your own soul or entity, and will put you in contact with those portions of your being from which your own vitality springs. You may or may not have your own encounters with past reincarnational selves or probable selves. You may or may not catch yourselves in the act of changing levels of consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有这种扩展能力的“你”，必然是个远比你先前想象的自己更有创造力与更具多次元的人格。我先前在这书里所建议的许多小练习，也会助你认识自己的实相，会让你直接体验自己的灵魂或存有的本质，并将使你与“你自己活力所源出的你存在的那些部分”接触。你也许会，也许不会与你过去转世的自己或可能的自己碰面。你也许会也许不会当场捉住你自己正在改变你意识的层面。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Certainly most of my readers, however, will have success with some of the suggested exercises. They are not difficult, and they are within the capabilities of all.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，我大多数的读者一定会做成一些我所建议的练习。它们并不难，而且它们是在所有人的能力之内的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Each reader, however, should in one way or another sense his own vitality in a way quite new to him, and find avenues of expansion opening within himself of which he was earlier unaware. The very nature of this book, the method of its creation and delivery, in themselves should clearly point out the fact that human personality has far more abilities than those usually ascribed to it. By now you should understand that all personalities are not physically materialized. As this book was conceived and written by a nonphysical personality, and then made physical, so do each of you have access to greater abilities and methods of communication than those usually accepted.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，每个读者，应该多少以一种对他来说很新的方式感觉到了自己的活力，而发现扩展之路在内打开，那些路是他先前没觉察到的。这本书的本质、其创造与传述方法的本身，就应清楚地指出这个事实，即人类人格有远比一般归之于它多得多的能力。到现在你应了解并不是所有人格都在肉体上具体化了。如这本书就是由一个不具肉体的人格所构思所写，然后再具体化，因此，你们每个人都能通达比那些通常被接受的还要更大的能力与通讯方式。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I hope that in one way or another this book of mine has served to give each of you an introduction to the inner multidimensional identity that is your own.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我希望我这本书，多少给你们每个人引介了本来就是你们自己的“内在多次元本体”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Louder): And that, my dear friend, is the end of dictation, and the book is finished.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(较大声地：)我亲爱的朋友，那就是口述的结束，而此书已写完了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Excellent, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“很精彩，赛斯”。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take a break. A well-deserved one.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息一下。这是一个理所应得的休息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30. The end of the book seemed to come abruptly even though we were prepared for it. Once out of trance, Jane again expressed her peculiar regret that Seth’s book was done, even though this was what we’d been working for. “What’s he going to do now?” she asked. “I can’t really believe it’s over, you know.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30。即使我们心有准备，这本书的结束仿佛还是突如其来。一旦脱离了出神状态，珍再度对赛斯书的完成表达了她奇怪的遗憾，虽然这正是我们一向努力的目标。她问：“他现在要做什么呢？你知道，我真不能相信事情已经结束了。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“We’ll just have to wait and see,” I replied. We made various joking remarks about what would come next in the sessions, but I could see that Jane didn’t really feel humorous. Actually, Seth’s own book contained so many ideas for future sessions that our problem would be what to explore first ---- and we would have the unaccustomed opportunity to carry out these studies at our leisure.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我答道：“我们只有等着瞧吧。”对“赛斯课”下一步会发生什么事，我们说了种种开玩笑的话，但我可以看出珍并不真觉得滑稽。实际上，赛斯自己的书对未来课的发展包含了这么多概念，我们的难题将是“首先去探索什么”——而我们将很难得的有机会在闲暇时来完成这些研究。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Finally Jane told me: “I’m just trying to relax…. He’s got something for you, I think, about those biblical times; the Crucifixion… The thing is, I know what Seth’s going to start telling you, but it’s confusing. It doesn’t sound right.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(最后珍告诉我：“我现在只是试着放松……我想，他有些东西要给你，关于那些圣经时代‘耶稣被钉十字架的事’……问题是，我知道赛斯将开始告诉你什么，但我弄不太清楚，听起来不对劲。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Well it’s nice to know you haven’t run out of words,” I said. The following material is included because it supplements Seth’s data in Chapter Twenty-one. After Seth began that chapter Jane and I realized we could become quite interested in biblical history, but our time for learning had been brief. Resume at 9:50, at a slower pace.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我说：“嗯，很高兴知道你话还没说完。”以下的资料包括在此，因为它补充了第二十一章里的赛斯资料。当赛斯开始了那章后，珍和我发现我们可能会变得对圣经历史相当有兴趣，但我们没有多少时间去学。在9:50以较慢的步调开始。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: For your edification:</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，为了你们的教化：</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Christ, the historical Christ, was not crucified…. You will have to give me time here. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>基督，历史上的基督，并没被钉十字架……现在你一定要给我一点时间。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>He had no intention of dying in that manner; but others felt that to fulfill the prophecies in all ways, a crucifixion was a necessity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他无意以那种方式去死；但其他人感到为了要在每一方面都实现那些预言，钉死于十字架是必要的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Christ did not take part in it. (Pause.) There was a conspiracy in which Judas played a role, an attempt to make a martyr out of Christ. The man chosen was drugged ---- hence the necessity of helping him carry the cross (see Luke 23) ---- and he was told that he was the Christ.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>基督并没有参与其事。(停顿。)有一件犹大在其中扮演了一个角色的阴谋，一个欲将基督造成为一位殉教者的企图。被选中的人被下了迷药——因而有帮他扛十字架的必要(见《路加福音》第二十三章)——而人家告诉他，他就是基督。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>He believed that he was. He was one of those deluded, but he also himself believed that he, not the historical Christ, was to fulfill the prophecies.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他相信他是基督。他是头脑不清的人之一，但他也相信是他，而非历史上的基督，要来实现那些预言。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Mary came because she was full of sorrow for the man who believed he was her son. Out of compassion she was present. The group responsible wanted it to appear that one particular portion of the Jews had crucified Christ, and never dreamed that the whole Jewish people would be “blamed.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>玛利亚来了，因为她替这个相信自己是她儿子的人满心忧伤，她出于同情而在场。负责此事的团体要它看来像是：某一特殊部分的犹太人钉死了基督，而绝没梦想到整个的犹太民族会被“怪罪”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:00.) This is difficult to explain, and even for me to unravel…. The tomb was empty because this same group carted the body away. Mary Magdalene did see Christ, however, immediately after (see Matthew 28). (Long pause.) Christ was a great psychic. He caused the wounds to appear then upon his own body, and appeared both physically and in out-of-body states to his followers. He tried, however, to explain what had happened, and his position, but those who were not in on the conspiracy would not understand, and misread his statements.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:00停顿。)很难解释这件事，即使是我也难以解开这谜……坟墓是空的，因为这同样的团体将尸体运走了。不过，玛利亚·玛达莲娜的确在事后立刻看到了基督(见《马太福音》第二十八章。停顿很久)。基督是个伟大的通灵者。神于是使伤口出现在神自己身上，而且同时以肉身以及“出体”状态出现在神的门徒前。不过，祂曾试着解释所发生的事以及祂所处的地位，但那些未参与阴谋者不能了解，而误解了祂的声明。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Peter three times denied the Lord (Matthew 26), saying he did not know him, because he recognized that that person was not Christ.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>彼得三次否认主(《马太福音》第二十六章)，说他不认识他，因为他认出那个人不是基督。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The plea, “Peter, why hast thou forsaken me?” came from the man who believed he was Christ ---- the drugged version. Judas pointed out that man. He knew of the conspiracy, and feared that the real Christ would be captured. Therefore he handed over to the authorities a man known to be a self-styled messiah ---- to save, not destroy, the life of the historical Christ.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“彼得，你为何舍弃了我？”这话，来自这个相信他自己是基督的人——被药麻醉者。犹大指出那个人，因为他知道这个阴谋，害怕真的基督会被抓到。因此他把一个众所周知自命为弥赛亚的人交给了当局——以援救而非毁灭历史上的基督生命。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:05. Jane’s pace had speeded up considerably by now.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:05。珍的步调现在快了不少。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Symbolically, however, the crucifixion idea itself embodied deep dilemmas and meanings of the human psyche, and so the Crucifixion per se became a far greater reality than the actual physical events that occurred at the time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，象征性地，“钉十字架”这概念本身表现出人类心灵的意义和深深的两难之局，因此“钉十字架”本身变成比当时发生的实际事件还要有大得多的真实性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Only the deluded are in danger of, or capable of, such self-sacrifice, you see, or find it necessary. Only those still bound up in ideas of crime and punishment would be attracted to that kind of religious drama, and find within it deep echoes of their own subjective feelings.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你要知道，只有头脑不清的人有危险或能够作这种自我牺牲或认为有其必要。只有那些仍为“罪与罚”概念所困的人会被那种宗教剧吸引，而在其内发现他们自己主观感受的深切回响。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Christ knew however, clairvoyantly, that these events in one way or another would occur, and the probable dramas that could result. The man involved could not be swerved from his subjective decision. He would be sacrificed to make the old Jewish prophecies come true, and he could not be dissuaded.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>无论如何，基督凭其“神通”能力知道这些事件多少会发生，以及它们会引起的可能戏剧。所涉及的那人的主观决定不能被动摇。他将被牺牲以使古老的犹太预言实现，而没人能劝止他。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:10.) In the Last Supper when Christ said, “This is my body, and this is my blood,” He meant to show that the spirit was within all matter, interconnected, and yet apart ---- that his own spirit was independent of his body, and also in his own way to hint that he should no longer be identified with his body. For he knew the dead body would not be his own.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:10)在“最后晚餐”之中，当基督说：“这是我的身体，这是我的血。”他是想显示在所有物质之内皆有“灵性”。“灵”与“物”彼此相连，却又分开——而祂自己的灵是与他的身体分开的，并且祂也在以自己的方式暗示不应再把神与祂的身体认同，因为祂知道那死尸将不是祂自己的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This was all misunderstood. Christ then changed his mode of behavior, appearing quite often in out-of-body states to his followers. (See John 20, 21; Matthew 28; Luke 24.) Before, he had not done this to that degree. He tried to tell them however that he was not dead, and they chose to take him symbolically. (A one-minute pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这全被误解了。于是基督改变了祂的行为方式，常常在“出体”的情况下显现给他的门徒(见《约翰福音》第二十、二十一章，《马太福音》第二十八章，《路加福音》第二十四章)。以前祂较少这样做。无论如何，祂是在试着告诉他们祂并没有死，而他们选择当祂是象征性地这样说。(停顿一分钟。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>His physical presence was no longer necessary, and was even an embarrassment under the circumstances. He simply willed himself out of it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他不再必要以肉身出现，甚至在那情况下是令人尴尬的。他就以念力使祂自己离开身体。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Thank you. It’s very interesting.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“谢谢你，真是太有意思了。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:17. “Wow,” Jane said after she came out of trance, “nobody’ll like that. But I tried to relax and let it come out, because I had so many questions about those times myself….”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:17。“噢！”珍说，当她脱离了出神状态之后，“没人会喜欢那种讲法，但我试着放松让它出来，因为我自己对那个时代有那么多的问题……”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I questioned Jane, but she hadn’t retained any images nor could she add to the material just given. The short delivery that follows answers some of the points we discussed at break. Resume at 10:28.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我询问珍，但她没留下任何影像，对刚给的资料她也没有可加的。以下短短的传述回答了在休息时我们讨论的某些点。在10:28继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: He knew that without the wounds, they would not believe he was himself, because they were so convinced that he died with those wounds. (See John 20.) They were to be a method of identification, to be dispensed with when he explained the true circumstances.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：祂知道没有那些伤口他们不会相信祂就是祂本人，因为他们如此确信神带着那些创伤死去(见《约翰福音》二十章)。那些创伤本是用来作为认明身份的一个方法，当神解释了真正情况时就不用了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>He ate to prove he was still alive, for example (John 21, Luke 24, etc.), but they took this simply to mean that the spirit could partake of food. They wanted to believe that he had been crucified and arisen.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>举例来说，祂吃东西以证明祂仍然活着(《约翰福音》第二十一章，《路加福音》第二十四章等)，但他们以为这是表示灵魂也能享用食物。他们想要相信祂已被钉死而又复活了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: I will end our session for the evening. I bid you a fond good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，我要结束今晚的课了。我祝你们有一个美好的晚上。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“All right. Thank you.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的。谢谢。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Tell Ruburt there will be other books. And I thank you for your help, cooperation, and patience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>告诉鲁柏还会有别的书。我谢谢你的帮助、合作与耐心。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I’ve been glad to do it.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我一直很高兴做这件事。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will have a private session next time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>下回我们将有次私人课。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Okay. Good night and thank you.” End at 10:30 P.M.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的。晚安，谢谢你。”在10:30结束。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(In the last two chapters Seth has answered just about all of the questions remaining on the list we had prepared originally for Chapter Twenty.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在最后两章里，赛斯差不多回答了我们本来为第二十章所准备的问题单上所剩下的问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(A note: Beneath a larger agreement, there are many differences in the details of the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. For instance, in John 19 it is said that Christ carried his own cross; in Luke 23, Simon from Cyrene is named as carrying Christ’s cross for him. Many complicated questions and reasons have been advanced in dealing with various aspects of the Gospels: their possible foundation in oral tradition and older common literary or documentary sources; whether any of them embodies an eyewitness account of the life of Christ [it has been very recently claimed that Mark’s was written only a few years after Christ’s death, for example], whether the Gospels should simply be regarded as expressing a single tradition, the fact and atmosphere of Christ, regardless of anything else, etc.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(注：《马太》、《马克》、《路加》和《约翰福音》大致上颇为一致，但在细节上则有许多不同。例如，在《约翰》第十九章，说到基督背祂自己的十字架；在《路加》第二十三章，指明古利奈人西门替基督背十字架。在处理各种版本“福音”的种种不同观点上，曾经有人提出了许多复杂的问题与理由：它们可能是建立在“口述传统”〔oral tradition〕及较老的平民文学或文件来源的基础上；“福音”是否来自对基督一生的一个目击者的说法〔例如最近有人曾声称《马克福音》只是在祂死了几年之后写的〕，福音是否应被认作只是在表达一个传统——基督的事实与祂周围的气氛，而不管所有其他的事等等。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(With a good deal of anticipation and not a little nervousness ---- Jane now began to read Seth’s book from page one. She was amazed.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍现在怀着很多预期与不少的紧张开始由第一页读赛斯的书，她为之惊奇不已。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>APPENDIX</a>
<a id=1 href=1>附录</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Seth devoted three full sessions and portions of two others to this Appendix. It includes additional information on several topics already mentioned in the book proper, such as coordination points, biblical times and records, objects as symbols, reincarnation, and expansion of consciousness. Sessions 592 and 594 are particularly intriguing in that events occurring during the sessions highlighted and illustrated the dictated material.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>赛斯花上三堂课及其他两课的一部分写这附录。它包括了对书中文本已论及的几个题目的补充资料，如交会点，圣经的时代与记录，物体作为象征，转世和意识的扩展。第592与594节特别吸引人，因为在课中发生的事件说明了口述的资料，并使之更凸显出来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We also added portions of six other sessions. Five are class sessions; one is included because it is relevant to the discussion on after-life organization in Chapter Nine. Another contains an excellent description of true spirituality. In the remaining class excerpts, Seth answers questions that readers might also have in mind.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们也加上了六节其他的课的部分内容。五次是ESP班上的课。其中之一是因为它与第九章对死后组织的讨论有关而被加进去；另一个包括对真正灵性的精彩描写。在余下的班上记录的摘录里，赛斯回答了读者心中可能有的问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>These sessions also show Seth as he relates to others in personal contact. To an engineer he gives an explanation of the pulsations of atoms, discussesmental health with a nurse and aggression with a minister ---- all class members. The sixth presentation is from a session held for a student in which Seth mentioned the Speakers for the first time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这些课也显示出赛斯在与别人有个人接触时的样子。他对一位工程师解释“原子的脉动”，与一位护士讨论精神健康，与一位牧师讨论攻击性——全是班上的学员。第六篇是来自为一个学生所举行的一课中，在其中赛斯第一次提及“说法者”。</a>
