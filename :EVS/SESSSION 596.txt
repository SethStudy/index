<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 595,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第595节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>SEPTEMBER 20, 1971, 9:01 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年9月20日 星期一 晚上9：01</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The first part of the session was given over to a friend who needed help with a personal problem. She taped Seth’s information, then left when break came at 9:45.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(此节的第一部分是为帮助解决一位友人的个人难题，她将赛斯的资讯录了音，然后在9:45休息时离开了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I had two questions for our portion of the session, and we expected that Seth’s answers would be included in the Appendix of his book. The first question: According to Seth, he, Jane and I lived in Denmark in the 1600’s. I simply wanted clarification of the data on my lifespan, as given in the notes at the end of the 541st session, in Chapter Eleven.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在我们这部分的课，我有两个问题，我们期待赛斯的回答会包括在他书的附录里。第一个问题：按照赛斯所说，他、珍和我在1600年代住在丹麦，我只是想弄清有关我活了多长的资料，如在第十一章第541节末尾的注里所给的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The second question: Did Seth intend to title Part One and Part Two of his book, as he had his chapters? Resume at 10:05.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(第二个问题：赛斯是否想给他书的第一部与第二部定标题，如他给每章定标题一样？在十点五分继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: I have to speak more slowly, you see.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你看吧，我必须说得慢一点。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The information on the Denmark life in Chapter Eleven is correct, except for a misinterpretation. That was one life divided into two separate periods ---- literally a life divided in terms of interests, concentration of abilities, and life styles.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在第十一章里，你在丹麦那一生的资讯是正确的，除了有一处误解之外。那是一辈子分成了分开的两段——真的是被不同的兴趣、能力的贯注与生活方式所分割开的一辈子。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Aside from the information given in that chapter, there have been distortions in some past material concerning that life. These were not caused by Ruburt’s feeling about reincarnation. They were simply a result of correlating many details into the correct specific pattern.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>除开在那一章所给的资讯外，在有关那辈子的某些过去资料有扭曲的地方。这些并不是被鲁柏对转世的感觉所引起，而只是把许多细节串成正确的特定模式时，所产生的结果。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Some of the names given, for example, applied to friends rather than to yourselves. The overall picture, the validity of the existence, carried through the distortions, however. I was a spice merchant. You were originally an artist, who turned rather dramatically into a landowner, and against your youthful ways.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>举例来说，我所说的有些名字，适用于你们的朋友而非你们自己。不过，整个的画面，那一次人生的合法性，并没受到那个曲解的影响。我的确是个香料商人。你原先是个画家，却相当戏剧性地变成了一位地主，而一反你年轻时的作风。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Ruburt was a dabbler in art as a young man also, and you resented this, grown fat and prosperous. You wanted him to go into more acceptable work, and you were ashamed of your own early wanderings as an itinerant artist.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当鲁柏还是个男孩时，他也曾涉猎画艺，而你憎恶此点，那时你已长得脑满肠肥。你要他进入更实际些的工作，你对自己早年做为巡回画家的流浪很感羞耻。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Here the division was set between the idea of owning property, as opposed to being an artist. In this life that has caused you considerable unease.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>此地，分隔是建立于，你想拥有产业的想法，相对于你做一个画家的身份。在此生那也一直令你相当的不安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:13. This is very true. And for whatever reasons, in this life I have insisted upon being an artist in spite of all obstacles.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:13。这讲得对极了。不论是为何理由，我在此生不顾所有的阻碍坚持做一个画家。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(In the 223rd session for January 16, 1966, Seth said that my name in the Denmark life was Larns Devonsdorf. My wife then was named Letti Cluse. My son ---- who is now Jane ---- was Graton. Seth, a prosperous merchant, traveler, and family friend, was named Brons Martzens.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在1966年1月16日的第223节，赛斯说我在丹麦那一生叫作Larns Devonsdorf。我那时的太太名叫Letti Cluse。我的儿子——他现在就是珍——叫Graton。赛斯，一个有钱的商人、旅行家和世交，名为Brons Martzens。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The general itinerary of my journeys as given in that session by Ruburt was correct. There were some distortions in other portions of that session, however.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在那节中鲁柏所给的我大概的旅程表是正确的。可是，在那节的其他部分则有一些扭曲。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause at 10:15.) The details that so concern you now are, of course, important, and yet in a larger way it is the deep emotional experience of your life that is “later” remembered. Basically the names and dates are meaningless to the inner self. Therefore in reincarnational data the emotional values will come through more vividly, and with much less distortion.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:15停顿良久。)当然，现在这么令你们关心的细节的确是重要的，但是以一个更大的角度来看，只有你们人生中深刻的情感经验才在“后来”被记起来。基本上，名字和日期对“内我”是无意义的。因此在转世资料里，情感的重要性会较生动地透过来，扭曲要少得多。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You place upon names and dates an importance you presently find of critical import. You insist upon them to add to the validity of past life narratives, yet these are precisely those things that are forgotten first, and that have least value psychologically.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你把你目前感到极重要的名字和日期看得很重，你坚持要得到那些资料，以增加前世叙述的确实性，但这些却正是最先被遗忘，而在心理上最没价值的事。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:20.) Certain names will, therefore, spring into immediacy. You insist that the names be neatly placed, and yet often the inner self has great difficulty in this regard, for names simply do not matter. Persons and events of meaning, carrying strong emotional charges, will come through far clearer. Dates that are associated with emotional events will also be recalled. The past life is (smile) like a crossword puzzle that must be put together, but at its center is the emotional reality from which the puzzle springs.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:20)因此，某些名字会立刻跃入眼前。你还坚持这些名字给整齐地排好，但是，“内我”在这方面常常感到很大的困难，因为名字根本就没什么关系。有意识的人和事，带着强烈的情感分量，会更为清晰地透过来。与情感性事件相联的日期也能被回想起。前生是(微笑)像个必须被拼拢起来的纵横字谜，但在其中心却是这字谜所缘起的情感实相。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth smiled because of Jane’s recently developed, rather strong interest in crossword puzzles. I enjoy them also. We’ve been speculating about the symbolic reasons behind our involvement.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯之所以微笑，是因为珍新近发展出对纵横字谜颇为强烈的兴趣，我也喜欢它们。我们一直在猜测我们的“迷上它”背后的象征性理由。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Many such reincarnational narratives are liberally sprinkled with names and dates simply to satisfy those who insist upon them, because the emotional and psychological validity may not be accepted otherwise. This applies to any kind of reincarnational material, however it may be obtained.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>许多这种对转世的叙述被自由的洒上许多人名和日期，只为了满足那些坚持要这些资料的人，否则的话，那些资料的情感上与心理上的合法性就可能不被接受。这适用于任何种类的转世资料，不论它是如何获得的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now if the life in question is a recent one, in your terms, the details may be more readily recalled and far more precise. Even a life centuries ago may be perfect in detail however if it included, for example, battles or events of great import, where the dates themselves were impressed upon the personalities because of the occurrences at those times.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，如果所说的一生在你们来说是最近的一生，细节也许比较容易回想，也更为精确。但甚至几世纪前的前世在细节上也可以很完美，如果它包括，譬如说，战役或非常重要的事件，在那种情形下因为在那时所发生的事，这个日期本身会在此人心里留下深刻的印象。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:29.) Any emotional experience that is highly charged will carry a barrage ofdetails along with it, but usual dates and usual names have little meaning. They have little meaning in your own reality. Basically speaking, relationships are far more important, and these you do not forget.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:29)任何负荷着强烈情感的经验都会伴随着一大堆的细节，但平常的日期与平常的名字则很少有意义。它们在你们自己的实相也很少有意义。基本上来说，人际关系是更为重要的，而这些你不会忘记。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>These lives exist simultaneously across the board, however. This you should not forget. The useless paraphernalia is not important to the various personalities, however, “now” or “then.” Do you follow me?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>然而，这些生生世世全盘同时存在。这点你不该忘记。不过，无用的行头则对那些种种的人格都不重要，不论是在“现在”或“那时”。你懂吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“懂的。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The reincarnational structure is built along the same lines of existence that you know now. Some individuals are more intrigued by detail than others: A particular “previous personality” may be one who had a great love of detail, in which case you would discover the richness of it. The particular likes and dislikes of any given personality will also have much to do with the descriptions given of a particular reincarnational episode.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>转世的结构是沿着你现在所知的人生这同一条线建立的，它们会有相似之处。有些人比其他人对细节更感兴趣：你的某个特定“先前的人格”可能很喜爱细节，在那情形你就会发现很丰富的细节。任一个人格的特殊好恶，也会与一个特定转世插曲的描述有很大的关系。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It will do no good to ask deep questions concerning the history of the times of some personality who was impoverished, ignorant, and limited. He simply would not know the answers. The picture of any given life, therefore, usually comes through the experience of the personality who lived it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>对某个贫苦、无知、狭窄的人格探问有关他那时代历史的深刻问题是没用的，他根本不知道答案。因此对任一生的“画面”，通常是透过活过那一生的那人经验而来的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:35.) Again, those details will emerge that were important to him. In my particular case, I am so unfocused on my own reincarnational selves, and they have gone so far on their own, that I have little feeling of immediacy. Since we [Seth, Jane, and I] have been so involved however, those relationships remain important, and in your terms our present relationship was latent then. The Denmark life exists as much as this one does for you. “You” are simply focused within this picture of reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:35停顿。)我再说一次：那些对他重要的细节会浮露出来。在我本身的例子里，我这么不贯注于我的转世自己身上，而他们也已独自走了这么远，以致我很少有直接的感受。但既然我们(赛斯、珍和我)曾有过如此深的缘分，那些关系仍然是重要的，在你们来说，我们目前的关系在那时就潜存着。对你而言，丹麦那一生就如这一生一样地存在着，“你”只是集中焦点在这个现实的画面里罢了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Thank you.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“谢谢你。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:37 to 10:50.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:37—10:50)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: The reincarnational structure is a psychological one. It cannot be understood in any other terms. The distortions and interpretations that have built up about it are natural enough, considering what seems to be your practical experience with the nature of time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：转世的结构是个心理上的结构。你不能以任何其他观点来了解它。围绕着它建立的种种扭曲与误解可以说是够自然的，如果考虑到你对“时间本质”仿佛具有的“实际经验”的话。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The reality, the validity, the immediacy of those lives do exist simultaneously with your present life. The distance between one life and another exists psychologically, and not in terms of years or centuries. The psychological distance, however, can be far more vast. There are certain lives, as there are certain events in this life, that you may not want to face or deal with. There may be great temperamental differences in some cases, between your personality in one given life and another ---- so that your present self simply could not relate to the other’s experience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那些个人生的真实性、合法性和直接性的确与你目前这一生同时存在。在一生与另一生之间的距离只存在于心理上，而非以年或世纪的说法存在。不过，心理上的距离，可能还更广大得多。有某些前生，就如在此生中有某些事件，是你不愿去面对或与之打交道的。还有些情形，你的人格在某一生与另一生可能有很大气质上的差异——因此，你现在的自己根本无法与那一生的经验发生关联。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You will be more strongly drawn to those “past lives” that somehow reinforce your own at this time. You realize that your early memories are sparse. Most of you remember little of the years spent as an infant and child. You make use of the knowledge gained then, and while it is part of you, you are not aware of it consciously; and so you are not consciously aware of other reincarnational existences. (In a whisper, humorously): New paragraph.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你会较强烈地被在某方面加强你这一生的那些“前世”所吸引。你了悟到你早期的记忆是很贫乏的。你们多半对孩提时所过的日子鲜少有记忆。你利用到在那时所获得的知识，而虽然它是你的一部分，你却并没有有意识地觉察到它；因此你也没有有意识地觉察到其他的转世生活。(幽默地耳语：)新的一段。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Earlier in this book I mentioned alternate presents on several occasions, and reincarnational lives are indeed alternate presents. There is interaction between you and your reincarnational selves constantly. There is, as your friend Sue Watkins· said, “constant action across the board.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在本书的前面，我在好几回提到“交替的现在”，而转世的生生世世的确就是“交替的现在”。在你与你的转世自己之间有经常的互动。像你的朋友苏所说的，有“全盘的一直不断的活动。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:01.) Those selves are not dead, in other words. Your understanding of this must be limited because you automatically think in terms of one life experience at a time, and in linear patterns of development. In your terms, a reincarnational self can be aware of your environment, and interact sometimes through your own relationships.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:01)换言之，那些自己并没有死。你对这个的了解一定很有限，因为你自动地以在一个时候只有一个生活经验的观点来看。并且以直线型的发展来看，以你们的话来说，一个“转世的自己”能知觉到你的环境，有时还透过你自己的人际关系而与别人相互影响。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Certain “present happenings” can, indeed, spark such interactions. In quite other terms, however, the reincarnated personality, while interacting with or through you, can still be having other kinds of experience at other levels.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>某些“现在发生的事”的确能引发这种交互作用。不过，以十分不同的方式来说，重新投胎了的人格，虽与你交互作用或透过你来交互作用，在其他层面上它仍能有其他的经验。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane’s delivery was quite animated and positive here, as though Seth wanted her gestures to underscore the material.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(此处珍的传述颇为有生气又有把握，好像赛斯要她作手势以强调这资料似的。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Because time is open-ended, as you think of it, you can also affect what you would think of as past reincarnational selves, and at times react in and to their environment. You would usually do this in the dream state, but this is often accomplished just below the level of waking consciousness, and is blotted out by you as you go about your daily business.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因为时间是开放的，当你想到这一点的时候，你也能影响你认为是过去的转世自己，而偶尔在他们的环境中反应或对他们的环境反应。你在梦境通常会做这事，但这通常是在紧接着“醒时意识”之下的层面完成，在你从事日常生活时被你抹掉了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:07.) Strong emotional associations can often trigger such responses. (Pause.) Reincarnation, as it is usually explained, in terms of one life before another, is a myth; but a myth enabling many to partially understand facts that they would otherwise dismiss ---- insisting as they do upon the concept of a continuity of time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:07)强烈的情感上的联想常能激发这种反应。(停顿。)如一般解释的转世，以一生在另一生前面的说法，的确是个迷思；但这个迷思却让许多人能部分地了解他们不然便会摒弃的事实——当他们还如现在这样坚持“时间的连续性”这个观念时。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take a break or end the session.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息一下，或结束此节。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“We’ll take the break, Seth.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我们休息一会儿，赛斯。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:10. Jane had been “way out” as she often puts it. She remembered only the first sentence or so of the material. All of her trances have been deep this evening. It takes her a bit longer to leave such a state; her eyes roll up occasionally, etc.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:00。珍曾“走得老远”，如她常说的。她只记得资料开头的一两句。她今晚所有的出神状态都很深。离开这样一个状态要花较长的时间；她的双眼偶尔还会上翻等等。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(At break I repeated my question about titles for Parts One and Two of Seth’s book. Resume in the same manner at 11:24.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在休息时，我重复我对赛斯书的第一部与第二部的标题问题。在11:24以同样方式继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We do not need to name the two portions separately. I had thought of specifically having the first part deal with inner and outer immediate environments, and then to lead to the larger reality of the soul and its perception in the second part. This is what I did, but the material is so interwoven that I felt the given separation enough, and did not want to reinforce the idea of a division.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们不必分别命名这两部分。我曾想到让第一部特别处理内在与外在的直接环境，然后在第二部分导向赛斯与其感知力的较大实相。我就是这样做的，但这资料是如此地交织在一起，使我觉得给过的分隔就已够了，而不想再加强一个划分的想法。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Smiling:) Now I could go on for hours, but I suggest that you get your rest.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(微笑：)我虽还可以继续好几小时，但我建议你还是休息吧！</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“It will be appreciated ---- the rest, that is.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“它会被珍惜的——我是指休息。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(And although I was getting weary, it was apparent that Seth could easily shift into a state where his energy would seem inexhaustible.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(虽然我是有点累了，但显然赛斯能轻易地转移到一个状态里，那儿他的精力似乎不可穷尽。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I bid you a most fond good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我祝你有一个最美好的晚上。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I thought the personal material you gave for our witness tonight [before first break] was excellent.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我认为今晚你给我们现场客人的资料[在第一次休息之前]很精彩。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It was indeed. It was tailor-made for her.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>的确不错，那是为她特地裁制的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: When the Appendix is done and your work with this book is finished, I will give you as many sessions as you would like, within reason, for yourself. And use the recorder.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当讲完了附录，而你对此书的工作也结束之后，我会给你尽你所要的那么多节课——在合理的范围内——为你自己。并且用录音机。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Okay. Good night, Seth, and thank you.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的。赛斯晚安，谢谢你。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:27 P.M. “That was funny,” Jane said, after she rested for a few minutes. “I was really out that last time but it was for such a short time that I really felt the transitions from ‘here’ to ‘there’ and back. That word Sue used ---- ‘acceleration’ ---- is a good one….” See the 594th session.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:27，她在休息几分钟后说：“蛮奇怪的，最后那回我其实是出去了，但只有那么短的时间，以致我真的感觉到了从‘这儿’到‘那儿’又回来的‘转移’。苏用的那个字——‘加速’——用得很好……”见第594节。)</a>
