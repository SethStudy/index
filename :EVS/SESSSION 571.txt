<a id=1 href=1>MARCH 1, 1971, 9:10 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年3月1日 星期一 晚上9：10</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(As in the last session, Jane began speaking in ar unhurried but quite businesslike manner.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(与上一节一样，珍开始以一种不慌不忙却十分认真的态度说话。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Dictation: There are also various states of consciousness in waking life, upon which you do not focus, and of which you are usually quite unaware. Each state knows its own conditions and is familiar with a different kind of reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>口述：在醒时生活里也有各种不同的意识状态，你没对它们集中焦点而通常对它们相当地不觉察。每种意识状态都知道它自己的情况，而且各自熟习于一种不同的实相。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“You” presently have a once-centered consciousness, in that “you” close off from your experience these other stages of consciousness in which other portions of your entire identity are intimately involved. These other stages of consciousness create their own realities as you create your own. The realities are, therefore, byproducts of consciousness itself. If you could become aware of these, they might appear to be other places to you, rather than realms[realms] or fields of different kinds of activities. If you probe into these realms[realms] you will be forced to perceive them with the root assumptions of your own system, translating feelings of warmth and comfort, for example, into images of warm shelters or buildings, or feelings of fear into images of demons.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“你”目前有一种“曾经集中于一点”(once-centered)的意识，因为“你”把这些意识的其他阶段关在你的经验之外，但你全部本体的其他部分非常亲密地涉入那些阶段里。这些意识的其他阶段创造他们自己的实相，就如你创造你自己的。因此，实相是意识本身的副产品。如果你能变得知觉到这些实相，你可能把它们看成是人间的其他地方，而非完全不同类的活动所在的领域或场所。如果你深入探讨这些领域，你会被迫以你自己系统的基本假设来感知它们，例如，把温暖与舒适的感觉转译为温暖的庇护所或房子的形象，或将恐惧感转译为恶魔的形象。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>On occasion even in waking life a personality may spontaneously shift gears, so to speak, and suddenly find itself for a second or perhaps a few moments within another such realm. Disorientation usually occurs. There are those who do this quite deliberately with training, but often they do not realize that they are interpreting the experiences they have with the values of their “home” consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>偶尔甚至在醒时，一个人格可能自动自发地换了档，可以这样说，突然发现它自己有一秒钟或几分钟在另一个这种领域之内，而通常会发生迷失感。也有些人经过训练而相当有意地这样做，但他们却常没了悟到，他们是以他们“老家”意识的价值观去诠释其经验。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:23.) All of this is not as esoteric as it might seem. Almost every individual has had bizarre experiences with consciousness, and knows intuitively that their greater experience is not limited to physical reality. Most dreams are like animated postcards brought back from a journey that you have returned from and largely forgotten. Your consciousness is already oriented again to physical reality; the dream, an attempt to translate the deeper experience into recognizable forms. The images within the dream are also highly coded, and are signals for underlying events that are basically not decipherable.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:23停顿。)所有这些并不如它看起来那么玄秘。几乎每个人都有意识上的古怪经验，而直觉地知道他们更大的经验是不受限于物质实相范围内的。大半的梦是像你从一个你大部分已遗忘了的旅程带回来有生命的风景明信片。你的意识已经再次地定位于物质实相了，而那个梦是个把更深的经历转译为可认识形式的企图。梦中形象也是极度“密码式”的，是潜藏在梦底下的事件的信号，这事件基本上是无法破解的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The Speakers help you in the formation of dreams which are indeed multidimensional artistic productions of a kind ---- dreams existing in more than one reality, with effects that dissect various stages of consciousness that are real, in your terms, to both the living and the dead and in which both the living and the dead may participate. It is for this reason that inspirations and revelations are so often a part of the dream condition.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“说法者”帮助你构成梦,它们的确可算是一种多次元的艺术产品——存在于不止一个实相的梦，其效果切开了意识的各个不同阶段，以你们的话来说，那些阶段对生者和死者都是真的，而在其中生者和死者都能参与。为此之故，灵感与启示才会如此常是梦的一部分。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Divorced from physical focus, you are in a better position to hear the Speakers, to translate their instructions, to practice with the creation of images, and to be guided in the methods of maintaining the health of the physical body. In the most protected areas of sleep, the apparent barriers between many layers of reality vanish. You are aware, for example, of some probable realities. You choose which probable acts you want to actualize in your system. You follow other probable acts through in the dream state. You do this individually, but you also do it en masse on national and global levels.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当你心念不以物质世界为焦点时，你才比较容易听到“说法者”，去转译他们的教导，去练习创造形象，并且被教以维持身体健康的方法。在睡眠之最隐密最被保护的区域里，在实相许多层面之间的明显障碍消失了。比如说，你觉知到了一些可能的实相，于是你选择你想在你的系统里实现哪一项可能行动。在梦境你贯彻其他的可能行动以观察其结果。你们自个儿这样做，但你们也在全国性与全球性的层面集体这样做。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:34. Break was a little early. Jane was surprised, since she thought much more time had passed. I told her the material was most interesting. Resume in the same deliberate manner at 9:40.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:34。休息来得早了一点。珍感到惊讶，因为她以为已经过了多得多的时间。我告诉她那些资料极有意思。在9:40以同样从容不迫的方式继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Consciousness at different levels or stages perceives different kinds of events. In order to perceive some of these you have only to learn to change the focus of your attention from one level to another. There are minute chemical and electromagnetic alterations that accompany these stages of consciousness, and certain physical changes within the body itself in hormone production and pineal activity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>意识在不同的层面或阶段感知到不同类的事件。为了要感知一些这种事件，你只需学会把你注意力的焦点从一个层面转换到另一个层面。伴随着这些意识的不同阶段有微细的化学与电磁的改变，而在肉体本身也有在荷尔蒙制造与松果腺活动上的实质改变。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You usually glide from wakefulness through to sleep without ever noticing the various conditions of consciousness through which you pass, yet there are several. First, of course, with various degrees of spontaneity, there is the inward turn of consciousness away from physical data, from worries and concerns of the day. Then there is an undifferentiated level between wakefulness and sleep where you act as a receiver ---- passive but open, in which telepathic and clairvoyant messages come to you quite easily.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>通常你由清醒状态滑入睡眠，全然不觉你经过的各种意识的不同状况，但其间是有几种阶段的。当然，首先，带着不同程度的自发性，意识向内转离开物质，离开了当时的忧虑与关注。然后在醒与睡之间有一个未分划的层面，在那儿，你变作一个被动却开放的“收受者”，这时你很容易收到心电感应与千里眼式的信息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Your consciousness can seem to float. There are varying physical sensations, sometimes of growing large, sometimes of falling. Both sensations are characteristic of moments in which you almost catch yourself, almost become aware of this undifferentiated area, and then translate some of its experiences into physical terms. The sensation of largeness, for example, is a physical interpretation of the psychic expansion. The feeling of falling is an interpretation of a sudden return of consciousness to the body.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你的意识可能彷佛在飘浮。有各种不同的身体感受，有时是胀大，有时是下坠。两种感觉都是某些“片刻”的特征，在那些片刻你几乎抓到你自己了，几乎对这未分划的地区有点觉知了，然后你又把自己在其间的一些体验转译成具体的。例如，胀大的感觉是心灵扩展的一个实质诠释。下坠的感觉是意识突然返回身体的一种诠释。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:50.) This period can last for only a few moments, for half an hour, or can be returned to. It is a cushioning, supportive, and expansive stage of consciousness. Suggestions given during this time are highly effective. Following this period there is an active state, that can occur, of pseudodreaming, where the mind busies itself with physical concerns that have managed to cling through the first two stages.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:50停顿。)这一段时间只能维持个几分钟、半小时，或可以再回去。它是意识的一个缓冲的、有支持作用的与扩展的阶段，在这个时候所给的“暗示”是非常有效的。在这一段之后，可能发生一个做假梦(pseudodreaming)的活跃状态。在“假梦”里，心智本身忙着处理那些经过前两个阶段仍紧抓不放的世间关注。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If these are too vigorous, the individual may awaken. This is a vivid, intense, but usually brief stage. Another undifferentiated layer follows, this time marked quite definitely by voices, conversations, or images, as consciousness tunes in more firmly to other communications. Several of these may compete for the individual’s attention. At this point the body is fairly quiet. The individual will follow one or another of these inner stimuli to a deeper level of consciousness, and form into light dreams the communications he is receiving.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果这些梦过于剧烈，这个人可能会醒过来。这是一个鲜活、热烈却常很短的阶段。另一个不分明的层面随之而来，当意识更坚定地对准其他层次的通讯，这次很明确的会有声音、谈话或形象出现。也许这好几种现象在争取这个人的注意。在这一刻身体相当地安静，而这人会跟着这种内在刺激之一进入意识的更深层面，而把它接到的讯息形成一些浅梦。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Somewhere during this time he will go into a deeply protected area of sleep, where he is at the threshold to other layers of reality and Probabilities. At this point his experiences will be out of all context to time as you know it. He may experience years though only minutes have passed. He will then return toward physical reality in an area marked as REM sleep by your scientists, where physically oriented dream productions will be created, putting the knowledge he has gained into use.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这段时间中有某一刻，他会进入一个深深地被保护的睡眠区域，在那儿，他是处于到其他层面的实相或可能性的门槛处。在这一点，他的经验将超出你们所知的时间范畴。虽然只有几分钟过去，他却经历了好几年。然后他会回向人间，到一个你们科学家称为REM睡眠的地带(译注：REM即Rapid Eye Movement，指眼球快速转动，大做其梦的阶段)，他用所获得的知识，在那儿创造出人世取向的梦。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:00.) The cycle would then be repeated. Almost the same kinds of fluctuations and stages occur even when you are waking, however, though you are even less aware of them because then the egotistical self acts quite purposefully to blanket out these other areas of experience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:00。)然后这周期会再重复下去。可是，即使在你醒时，也几乎有同样的波动和阶段发生，虽然你对它们甚至更不知不觉，因为，那时自我性的自己十分有意的去遮盖住这些其他经验的区域。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The precise stages are present beneath waking awareness, however, and with the same chemical, electromagnetic, and hormonal fluctuations. You simply are not aware of what your consciousness is doing. You cannot yourselves keep track of it for five full moments of your time. The dimensions of it can only be sensed by those determined enough to take the time and effort required to journey through their own subjective realities. Yet intuitively each individual knows that a part of his experience escapes from him all the time. When you suddenly cannot remember a name that you should know, you have in essence the same kind of feeling of which you are always subconsciously aware.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，在清醒的知觉之下也有精确的阶段在，并有同样化学的、电磁的与荷尔蒙的波动。你根本没察觉你的意识在做什么，你自己连追踪它五分钟也做不到。只有那些有足够决心去花费所需的时间与功夫，旅历过他们自己主观领域的人，才能感觉到意识的次元之广。直觉上，每个人却都知道他有一部分的经验总是逃过了自己。当你突然想不起一个你应当知道的名字，在本质上你有同一种感觉：在潜意识上你是永远觉察的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The purpose of the Speakers is to help you correlate and understand this multidimensional existence, and to bring as much as possible of it to your conscious attention. Only by learning to feel, or sense, or intuitively perceive the depths of your own experience can you glimpse the nature of All That Is. By becoming more aware of your consciousness as it operates in physical life, you can learn to watch it as it manipulates through these other less familiar areas. Probable realities are only probable to you because you are not aware of them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“说法者”的目的是要助你了解这多次元的存在，并且与它发生关联，而把它尽可能的带到你有意识的注意层面上。只有靠学着去感觉、感受或直觉地感知你自己经验的深度，你才能对“一切万有”的本质略见一斑。当你更为觉察意识如何在日常生活中运作时，你便能学会观察它，看它如何运作于这些其他较不熟悉的区域。可能的实相对你只是可能的，因为你对它们无所知觉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:11. Jane’s trance had been good. Her delivery tonight, without voice effects, with only short pauses and a minimum of gestures, was the kind that seemingly could continue indefinitely. At break I asked if Seth would title the first eight chapters of his book, as he began doing from Chapter Nine on. Resume in the same manner at 10:26.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:11。珍的出神状态很好。她今晚的传述没有变声的效果，只有短短的停顿与最少的手势，是那种似乎可以无限继续下去的传述。在休息时我问赛斯，是否要给他的书的前八章命题，像他自第九章起所做的一样。在10:20以同样方式继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: These stages of consciousness are all a part of your own reality. A knowledge of them can be most useful. You can learn to “shift gears,” stand aside from your own experience, and examine it with much better perspective. You can prepare questions or problems, suggesting that they be solved for you in the sleep state. You can suggest that you will speak with distant friends, or convey important messages that you cannot convey verbally, perhaps. You can bring about reconciliations, for example, at another layer of reality though you cannot do so in this one.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>意识的这些阶段全是你自己实相的一部分，对它们的认识用处非常大。你可以学习“换档”，由你自己的经验站开，而从清楚得多的角度去检查它。你可以准备好问题或难题，自我建议在你的睡眠状态里解决它们。你可以建议自己与远方的友人谈话，或传递你也许无法用语言传达的重要信息。例如，你可以在实相的另一层面达成和解，虽然你在这个实相做不到。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You can direct the healing of your body, telling yourself that this will be accomplished by you at one of the other levels of sleep consciousness, and you may ask for the aid of a Speaker to give you any necessary psychological guidance that is needed to maintain health. If you have particular conscious goals and if you are reasonably certain that they are beneficial ones, then you can suggest dreams in which they occur, for the dreams themselves will hasten their physical reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以主导你肉体的治愈，告诉你自己，在睡眠意识的一个其他层面里你可以完成此事，而你也可以向一位“说法者”求援，请他给你维护健康所需的任何必要的心理指导。如果你有特定有意识的目标，而且你相当肯定它们是有益的，那么你可以建议它们在梦中发生，因为梦本身会促进它们在人间实现。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now unconsciously you do many of these things. You often go back in time, so to speak, and “relive” a particular event so that it has a different ending, or say things that you wish you had said. A knowledge of one state of consciousness can help you in other states. In a light trance the meaning of dream symbols will be given if you ask for them. The symbols may then be used as methods of suggestion that will be tailored for you personally. If you discover, say, that a fountain in a dream represents refreshment, then when you are tired or depressed, think of a fountain. In another layer of reality, of course, you will be creating one.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>其实你无意识地做许多这种事。可以说你常回溯到过往而“重新经历”一件特定的事件，以使它有个不同的结局，或说出你希望你曾说的话。认识意识的一个阶段，能在其他的阶段里对你有帮助。在轻度的出神状态里，如果你问，就会得到梦中象征的意义。然后你可以用这些象征做适合你个人的“自我提示”。好比如果你发现在一个梦里，喷泉代表恢复活力，那么当你疲乏或低潮时，想想喷泉。当然，在另一个实相层面，你将会创造出一个喷泉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:35.) In the most protected areas of sleep you are dealing with experience that is pure feeling or knowing, and disconnected from both words or images. As mentioned, these experiences are translated into dreams later, necessitating a return to areas of consciousness more familiar with physical data. Here a great creative synthesis and a great creative diversification takes place, in which any given dream image has meaning to various layers of the self ---- on one level representing a truth you have lived and on other levels representing this truth as it is more specifically applied to various areas of experience or problems. There will be a metamorphosis, therefore, of one symbol turning into many, and the conscious mind may only perceive a chaos of various dream images, because the inner organization and unity is partially hidden in the other areas of consciousness through which the reasoning mindcannot follow.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:35)在睡眠最被保护的区域里，你正在处理纯感性或知性的经验，与文字或形象都分离了。如我说过的，这些经验后来被转译为梦，必须回到意识里较熟悉实质资料的区域。在此发生了一个伟大创造性的合成，与一个伟大创造性的多样化，在其中造出的任何一个梦中形象，对“自己”的各个不同层面皆有意义——在某一层面，代表你曾实践过的一个真理，而在另一层面代表这个真理当它更特定地应用到各种不同的经验或问题时。因此，会有一个蜕变，一个象征转成了许多象征，而“意识心”可能只感知到形形色色的梦影纷纷，因为内在的组织与统一是局部地隐蔽于意识的其他区域内，而好推理的心智无从追随过去。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The unconscious and subconscious areas, however, are aware of much more of this information than the ego, for it receives only the minute residue of dream material as a rule. The Speakers therefore may appear within dreams as historical characters, as prophets, as trusted old friends, or in whatever guise will impress the particular personality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，无意识和潜意识的区域对这资料比自我要觉察得多得多，因一般而言，自我只收到梦中资料的微量残渣。因此，“说法者”可以历史人物、先知、所信赖的老友或任何能给这个人深刻印象的扮相出现。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause.) In the original experience, however, the true nature of the Speaker is apparent. The production of dreams is as “sophisticated” an endeavor as is the production of the objective life of a given individual. It is simply living on different terms.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(停顿。)不过，在那个原始的经验里，“说法者”的真正性质是显而易见的。梦的制作与任一个人客观生活的制作都是一样需要“成熟练达”的一件工作。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now that is the end of dictation, and just about the end of our chapter, though not quite.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>口述到此结束，本章虽然还没完，也差不多快结束了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause.) Do not worry about the [first eight] chapter headings ---- we will get to them. We will end the session or answer any questions if you prefer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(停顿。)别担心前八章的命题——我们会开始着手的。我们将结束此节，或如果你想问问题也可以。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I guess not, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我想不用了，赛斯。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Then my heartiest good wishes to you both ---- and tell our friend Ruburt to try the suggestions given in the material this evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么给你俩我最衷心的祝福——告诉我们的朋友鲁柏试试今晚资料里所给的建议。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I’d thought of that.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我也想到了。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Three nights in a row. And now a fond good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>连着做三个晚上。现在向你道晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth. Thank you very much.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。非常感谢你。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I’m glad you enjoy my book.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我很高兴你欣赏我的书。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I do.” End at 10:45 P.M.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我的确欣赏。”在10:40结束。)</a>
