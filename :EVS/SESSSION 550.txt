<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 547,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第547节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>AUGUST 24, 1970, 9:10 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1970年8月24日 星期一 晚上9：10</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will resume dictation. (Jane, as Seth, directed an inquiring look at me.) Unless you have any preliminary questions…</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们将继续口述。(珍作为赛斯，以询问的眼光看着我。)除非你先有什么问题要问——</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“No.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“没有。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are some points I would like to add here. The time of choosing is somewhat more complicated if the last reincarnational cycle, in your terms, is completed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在此我想再补充几点。如果在你们来说，最后一次的轮回已经完成了，那这选择时间就多少会更复杂了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>First of all you must understand, again, that now you do not realize your true identity. You identify instead with your present ego, so when you think in terms of life after death you really mean a future life of the ego that you know. At the end of the reincarnational cycle you understand quite thoroughly that you, the basic identity, the inner core of your being, is more than the sum of your reincarnational personalities.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>首先你必须了解的是，你现在并不知道你真正的本体，反倒与你目前的自我认同，因此当你想到所谓死后的生活时，你实际上是指你“所知的自我”的未来生活。在轮回结束时，你十分透澈地了解你的基本本体、你存在的内核是比你所有转世人格的总和还要广大的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You might say that the personalities then are but divisions of your self here. There is no competition between them. There never was any real division, but only a seeming one in which you played various roles, developed different abilities, learned to create in new and diverse ways. These reincarnational personalities continue to develop, but they also understand that their main identity is also yours.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那时候，你可以说那些人格只不过是此时你自己的分段(divisions)而已。在他们之间并没有竞争。从来也没有任何真正的分段，只是看起来似乎有分段，而在其中你扮演形形色色的角色，发展不同的能力、学着以新而多样化的方式创造。这些转世的人格继续在发展，但他们也了解，他们的主要本体也就是你的本体。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>When the cycle is finished, therefore, you have complete knowledge of your past lives. The information, experience, and abilities are at your fingertips. This merely means that you understand your multidimensional reality in practical terms. I have used the word multidimensional often, and you see I mean it quite literally, for your reality exists not only in terms of reincarnational existences but also in the probable realities mentioned earlier.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，当轮回完结了，你拥有你所有前生的全部知识。那些资料、经验和能力就在你的手边。这只表示你实际地了解了你的多次元实相。我常用多次元这字，你要明白我的确是指那个意思，因为你的实相不只存在于转世的存在里，也还存在于前面提过的可能实相里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>When the time of choosing comes, therefore, the choices available are far more diverse than those offered or possible to personalities who must still reincarnate. There is always the opportunity to teach if you have the inclination and the capabilities, but multidimensional teaching is far different than teaching as you know it now, and it demands rigorous training.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>所以，当选择的时候到了，可作的选择种类要比给那些必须再转世的人多得多。如果你有那种倾向和能力，你总有作老师的机会。但多次元的教学与你现在所知道的极为不同，它要求严格的训练。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Such a teacher must be able to instruct various portions of one entity, in your terms, at the same time. Say, for example, a particular entity has reincarnations in the fourteenth century, [in] 3 B.C., in the year A.D. 260, and in the time of Atlantis. A teacher would simultaneously be in contact with these various personalities, communicating with them in terms that they could understand. Such communication demands a complete knowledge of the root assumptions of such eras, and of the general philosophical and scientific climate of thought at the time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这样一位老师必须要能同时教导所谓一个本体的各个不同部分。例如，且说有某个“存有”在14世纪、在第3世纪、在公元前260年以及在亚特兰蒂斯时代都有转世的片段体。一位老师即将同时与这些不同的人格接触，以他们所能了解的用语与之沟通。这样的沟通要求他对这些时代的基本假设，及一般的哲学与科学思想的氛围，有完全的知识。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:26.) The entity might well be exploring several probable systems too, and these personalities would also have to be reached and contacted. The amount of knowledge and training necessary makes such a teaching communicator-career extremely demanding, but it is one of the courses available. The process of learning such information necessarily adds to the development and abilities of the teacher. A delicate manipulation of energy is required, and a constant travel through dimensions. Once such a choice is made, training immediately begins, always under the leadership of a practical expert. The vocation, for it is a vocation, leads such a teacher even into other realms[realms] of reality than those he previously knew existed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:26)那“存有”也很可能正在探索好几个可能的系统，老师也必须与这些人格连络接触。所必需的知识量与训练，使这样一个教学、传播事业要求极高，但这是，可走的一条路。学习这种资料的过程必然会对老师的发展与能力有帮助。对能量的巧妙操纵是需要的，还要经常的在各次元间穿梭旅行。一旦作了这样的一个选择，训练立即开始，总是在一位实际的专家领导下，这天职(vocation)——因为它是个天职——会引导这样一位教师进入他以前甚至不知其存在的其他实相领域中去。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Others, finished with reincarnations and of a different overall nature, may begin the long journey leading toward the vocation of a creator. On a much different plane, this can be compared to geniuses in creative fields within your own physical reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>其他结束了转世而有一个不同的“总和天性”的人，可能会开始步入成为一个创造者的漫长旅程。在一个很不同的层面上，这可以比之为你们自己的物质实相中创造界的天才。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Instead of paints, pigments, words, musical notes, the creators begin to experiment with dimensions of actuality, imparting knowledge in as many forms as possible ---- and I do not mean physical forms. What you would call time is manipulated as an artist would manipulate pigment. What you would call space is gathered together in different ways.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不用油漆、颜料、文字、音符，创造者代之以真实的次元来实验，以尽可能多的形式——我不是指物质形式——来传授知识。你们会称之为“时间”的东西被操纵得好像画家操纵颜料一样。你们会称之为“空间”的东西是以不同的方法集合在一起的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Art is created, then, using time ---- for example ---- as a structure. In your terms time and space might be mixed. The beauties of various ages, the natural beauties, the paintings and buildings are all recreated as learning methods for these beginners. One of their main preoccupations is to create beauty that impinges itself in as many various dimensions of reality as possible.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，举例来说，用时间作为结构，艺术被创造出来。以你们的话来说，时间和空间可以被混合起来。各个不同时代的美、自然的美、绘画和建筑，全都为这些初学者再创造出来，以作为学习的方法。他们最全神贯注的要务之一，就是创造出能在尽可能多的不同实相次元中造成影响的美。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Such a work would be perceived in your system as one thing, for example, but would also be perceived in probable realities, though perhaps in an entirely different way ---- a multidimensional art, you see, so free and elemental that it would appear simultaneously in many realities.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>举例来说，这么一件作品在你们的系统里看来是一个模样，但它在可能的实相里也会被看到，虽则也许以完全不同的方式——你懂吗？它是一项多次元的艺术，如此的自由与自然，所以它会同时出现在许多实相里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Such an art is impossible to describe in words. The concept has no verbal equivalent. These creators, however, are also involved in inspiring those in all levels of reality available to them. For example, inspiration in your system is often the work of such creators.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这样一件艺术是笔墨难以形容的，这观念也没有相等的文字。可是，这些创造者也致力于对他们可及的所有各种实相层面中的人们提供灵感。例如，在你们系统中的灵感就常是这种创造者的杰作。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break and we shall continue.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你休息一下，我们再继续。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:44 to 10:00.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:44—10:00)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: These “art forms” are often symbolic representations of the nature of reality. They will be interpreted in various ways, according to the abilities of those who perceive them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：这些“艺术形式”常常是实相本质的象征性表现。依照觉知到它的人的能力，它们会被给以不同的诠释。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In your terms they may be living dramas. They will always be psychic structures, however, existing apart from any given system of reality, but at least partially perceived by many. Some exist in what you might term the astral plane, and you perceive them in visits during the sleep state.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在你们来说，它们可能是现场演出的“活剧”。但是，它们永远是心灵的结构，存在于任何一个实相系统之外，但至少被许多人部分感知到。有些存在于你可能称为星光层面(astralplane)的地方，你在睡眠状态中去探访时会感知它们。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:03. Our cat, Willy, suddenly jumped up into Jane’s lap ---- just as he’d done in the last session. Instinctively I spoke to him rather loudly, afraid he’d shock Jane out of trance. Her eyes flickered at the sound of my voice, but she continued speaking. Willy jumped down.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:03。我们的猫威立突然跳进了珍的怀中——正如它在上一节里所做的。我本能地相当大声地跟它说话，怕它把珍吓得脱离了出神状态。我的声音使珍的眼睛闪动了一下，但她继续讲话。威立跳了下来。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Others are perceived in glimpses or bits and pieces by your temporal mind while you are half-sleeping and half-waking, or in other periods of dissociation. There are various kinds of multidimensional art, and therefore many levels in which the creators work. The whole Christ story was such a creation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当你在半睡半醒时，或在其他的解离时期，你现世的心智也感知到其他“艺术形式”的点点滴滴。有各种不同的多次元艺术，所以创造者在许多层面中工作。整个“基督”的故事就是这样的一个创造。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:06. I sneezed. This wasn’t the first time I had sneezed since the session started.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:06停顿。我打了个喷嚏。自课开始后这不是我第一次打喷嚏。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are also those who choose to be healers, and of course this involves far more than healing as you are familiar with it. These healers must be able to work with all levels of the entity’s experience, directly helping those personalities that are a part of it. Again, this involves a manipulation through reincarnational patterns, and here again, great diversification. A healer begins with reincarnational selves with various difficulties….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>也有些人选择作疗愈者(healers)，当然这涉及的范围远比你们所熟知的疗愈要大得多。这些疗愈者必须要能与“存有”经验的所有层面打交道，直接帮助那些为“存有”一部分的“人”。再次的，这涉及一种贯通转世模式的操纵，此处又再次涉及了很大的变化，疗愈者对有种种不同困难的“转世的自己”开始着手……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I sneezed three times.) Do you want a break?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我打了三次喷嚏。)你要休息一下吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I guess not.” Although I took a moment to think it over.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我想不要。”虽然我花了一分钟来考虑。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The healing involved is always psychic and spiritual, and these healers are available to help each personality in your system as you know it, in your present time, and in other systems.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>所涉及的疗愈永远是心灵上和精神上的，这些疗愈者总是等着帮助你现在所知系统里的每一个人，以及在其他系统里的每一个人。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In a larger context, and with greater training, advanced healers deal with the spiritual maladies of vast numbers of personalities. There are those who combine the qualities of teacher, creator, and healer. Others choose lines of development that are particularly suited to their own characteristics.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在更大的脉络里，有更多训练的、高深的疗愈者处置广大人群的“心病”。还有一些人综合了老师、创造者和疗愈者的特质。其他人则选择特别适合他们自己特性的发展方向。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I suggest your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我建议你休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:15. Willy had begun to act up again, so I deposited him in another room and closed the door. Jane said she had been bothered by him, and by my sneezing. She had a vague memory of the near-shout I’d directed at Willy. My own energies, she said, were very scattered this evening; she had picked this up. It was certainly true that I wasn’t at my best. I continued to sneeze after she resumed at 10:25.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:15。威立又再度乱搞起来，因此我把它放在另一间房里，关上了门。珍说她曾被威立和我的喷嚏所扰。她对我向威立的“近似吼叫”有模糊的印象。她说，我自己的能量今晚非常散漫：她感受到这点。我的确不在最佳状况。当她在10:25又开始后，我仍在继续打喷嚏。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I do not want to discuss the purpose of consciousness’s continuous existence or development in this chapter, however. I simply want to make it clear that vast possibilities of progress are possible, and to stress the fact that each personality has full freedom.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，我并不想在本章讨论意识的继续存在或发展的目的。我只想说清楚进步的广大可能性是可能的，并且强调每个人都有完全的自由这个事实。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The developments of consciousness that take place are natural attributes, natural stages. There is no coercion applied. All of the further developments are inherent in the personality that you know, even as the adult is inherent in the child.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>意识的发展是自然的属性、自然的阶段，并没有受到威逼。所有更进一步的发展是天生具备在你所知人格内的，即如成人天生就在儿童内。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now these descriptions of after-death events may sound very complicated, particularly if you have been used to a simple tale of heaven or eternal rest. Unfortunately, the words fail to describe many of the basics that I would have you understand. You have within yourself, however, the ability to release your intuitions and to receive inner knowledge.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>至于这些对死后事件的描写也许听来很复杂，尤其是如果你已习惯了一个关于天堂或永远的安息的简单故事，可惜文字无法描写我希望让你们了解的许多基本要点。不过，在你内心，你就有释出直觉而接受内在知识的能力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As you read this book, the words are meant to release your own intuitional abilities. When you are reading it, your own dreams will give you added information and will be in your mind upon awakening if you are alert for them. There is no such simple end to the life that you know, [such] as the story of heaven. There is the freedom to understand your own reality, to develop your abilities further, and to feel more deeply the nature of your own existence as a part of All That Is.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在你读这书时，文字是要使你释出自己的直觉能力。当你在读它时，你自己的梦将给你更多的资料，并且在你醒时会仍在你心内，如果你对它们够警觉的话。对你所知的生命并没有那么简单的结尾，(就)像天堂的故事。你有自由去了解自己的实相，去进一步发展你的能力，去更深地感受到你自己存在的本质原为“一切万有”的一部分。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:34.) That is the end of the chapter, and the end of our session unless you have questions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:34)那是本章的结尾，也是本节的结尾，除非你有问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“No, I guess not.” I was too tired and uncomfortable.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“没有，我想没有。”我太累而且不舒服。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>My heartiest regards to you both, and a fond good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>对你俩最衷心的祝福，晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: A small note. A portion of you was earlier projected to the hospital where your father is. Ruburt felt the absence of that part of you. You were simply trying to look in on him. In the very back of your mind you wondered if he knew, now, that he ever had hay fever, and it was that that triggered the unconscious projection.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：一个小注。你的一部分先前投射到你父亲所在的医院去了。鲁柏感觉到你有一部分缺席了。你只是试想顺道看望他。在你心深处，你奇怪不知他现在是否知道他曾得过枯草热。而就是那个引发了那无意识的投射。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Your unconscious self is a strong portion of our sessions, and it was for this reason that Ruburt sensed this absence. And now, good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>无意识的自己是我们课的一个很重要部分，也就是因为这个原因，鲁柏才感觉到你有一部分缺席了。现在晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth. Thank you.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安，谢谢你。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:39 P.M. The session ended comparatively early, for obvious reasons. Seth’s information about my unconscious projection was very interesting. An event of that kind could have easily caused my sneezing. There are strong connections involving my father, myself, and hay fever.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:39。为了很明显的理由，课结束得比较早。赛斯关于我的无意识投射的资料非常有趣。像那一类的事件是很可能很容易地引起我的喷嚏。在我父亲、我自己和枯草热之间有很强的关联。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(This is the season for hay fever. Although I’m not bothered much now, in earlier years I suffered with it extensively. I had my first bout when I was three years old. At about the same time my father got rid of his, for good. Seth told me some time ago that my father had given me his hay fever, and that for reasons of my own I had accepted the “gift.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(这是枯草热的季节。虽则我现在不大受扰，在早年我曾深受其害。我第一次发作是三岁时。在差不多同时我父亲永远地摆脱了它。不久前赛斯告诉我，我父亲把他的干草热给了我，而为了我自己的理由，我接受了那“礼物”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(My symptoms gradually subsided through the balance of the evening.) * An illustration of this painting appears in The Seth Material. The name Van Elver isn’t given in the caption, but the painting is easily identifiable.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在那儿余下的时间里，我的病象逐渐地减弱了。)</a>
