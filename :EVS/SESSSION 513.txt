<a id=1 href=1>1970年1月27日 星期二 晚上9：02</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Monday night’s regularly scheduled session was postponed until tonight.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(周一晚的定期课延到今晚。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane’s pace was quite slow, with many long pauses. A few are indicated in the material. Her voice was average; her eyes were open often.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍的速度相当慢，中间有许多次停顿很久。她的声音平常，眼睛常是睁开的。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, let us return to our new manuscript.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，我们回到新的稿子。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Since we have mentioned animals, let me say here that they do possess a kind of consciousness that does not allow them as many freedoms as your own. Yet at the same time, they are not hampered in its use by certain characteristics that often impede the practical potential of human consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>既然我们提到动物，让我说它们的确拥有一种意识，然而那意识却没给它们如你们那么多的自由。但是同时，在应用它的时候，动物却也没被常阻碍人类意识发挥实际潜能的某些特性所拖累。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Consciousness is a way of perceiving the various dimensions of reality. Consciousness as you know it is highly specialized. The physical senses allow you to perceive the three-dimensional world, and yet by their very nature they can inhibit the perception of other equally valid dimensions. Most of you identify with your daily physically oriented self. You would not think of identifying with one portion of your body and ignoring all other parts, and yet you are doing the same thing (smile) when you imagine that the egotistical self carries the burden of your identity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>意识是感知多重次元实相的途径。你们所知的意识是极为专门化的。肉体感官让你感知三次元的世界，但就由于它的这种本质，它同时也抑制了你对其他同样确切合法的次元的感知。你多半与你日常“物质取向的自己”认同。你不会想到与你身体的一部分认同，而忽略所有其他的部分，(微笑：)然而当你想象“自我的我”(egotistical self)就是你的整个身份时，你却是在做同样的事。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I am telling you that you are not a cosmic bag of bones and flesh, thrown together through some mixture of chemicals and elements. I am telling you that your consciousness is not some fiery product, formed merely accidentally through the interworkings of chemical components.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我在告诉你，你并非宇宙的一袋骨与肉，由某些化学物与地水火风等元素的混合物组合在一起。我在告诉你，你的意识并非由化学成分的交互作用意外地形成之某种炽热产物。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You are not a forsaken offshoot of physical matter, nor is your consciousness meant to vanish like a puff of smoke. Instead, you form the physical body that you know at a deeply unconscious level with great discrimination, miraculous clarity, and intimate unconscious knowledge of each minute cell that composes it. This is not meant symbolically.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你并非物质的一个被弃的旁支，你的意识也不会消失如一缕轻烟。相反的，在一个极深的无意识层面，你以绝大的辨识力、奇迹般的清晰，以及对组成身体的每一个细胞密切的无意识知识，造成了你所知的肉身。这并不是象征性的说法，而是确实如此。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now because your conscious mind, as you think of it, is not aware of these activities, you do not identify with this inner portion of yourselves. You prefer to identify with the part of you who watches television or cooks or works ---- the part you think knows what it is doing.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在，由于你以为的“意识心”没有觉察到这些活动，所以你不认同你内在的这个部分。你宁可和你在看电视、在做饭、或在工作的那部分认同——你认为它知道自己在做什么的那个部分。但你自身这看似无意识的部分，其实知道的多得多，全靠它的流畅运作，你整个肉体才得以存在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>But this seemingly unconscious portion of yourself is far more knowledgeable, and upon its smooth functioning your entire physical existence depends. This portion is conscious, aware, alert.  It is you, so focused in physical reality, who do not listen to its voice, who do not understand that it is the great psychological strength from which your physically oriented self springs.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这部分是有意识、有知觉而且警醒的。如此全神贯注于物质实相的你，却不去倾听它的声音，也不了解你那“偏重于物质的自身”就是从这伟大的心理力量跃出的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I call this seemingly unconscious the “inner ego,” for it directs inner activities. It correlates information that is perceived not through the physical senses, but through other inner channels. It is the inner perceiver of reality that exists beyond the three-dimensional. It carries within it the memory of each of your past existences. It looks into subjective dimensions that are literally infinite, and from these subjective dimensions all objective realities flow. (Long pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我称这看似无意识的部分为“内在自我”(inner ego)，因为它指挥内在的活动。它把非经由肉体感官而是其他内在管道得来的资料串联起来。它是“实相的内在感知者”，而它的存在超越了三次元之外。它携带着你们每个前世的记忆。它探入真正无止境的主观次元，所有客观的实相都是从这些主观次元源源流出的。(停了很久。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>All necessary information is given to you through these inner channels, and unbelievable inner activities take place before you can so much as lift a finger, flicker an eyelid, or read this sentence upon the page. This portion of your identity is quite natively clairvoyant and telepathic, so that you are warned of disasters before they occur, whether or not you consciously accept the message, and all communication takes place long before a word is spoken.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>所有必要的资料都经由这些内在通道给你，即使在你一举手或一眨眼或读这一句话之前，不可置信的内在活动已发生了。你本体的这个部分本自具足千里眼与心电感应的能力，因而在灾难发生前你已得到警告，不论你是否有意识地接受这信息。在一个字都还没说之前，所有的沟通都早已发生了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Quietly): I may pause now and then to give you a rest.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(安静地：)我可以时常停顿一下，好让你休息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I’m okay.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我没问题。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The “outer ego” and the inner ego operate together, the one to enable you to manipulate in the world that you know, the other to bring you those delicate inner perceptions without which physical existence could not be maintained.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“外在自我”(outer ego)与内在自我一同运作，其一让你能在你所知的世界里操纵自如，另一带给你那些微妙的内在知觉，没有它们肉体生活即不可能维持。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There is however a portion of you, the deeper identity who forms both the inner ego and the outer ego, who decided that you would be a physical being in this place and in this time. This is the core of your identity, the psychic seed from which you sprang, the multidimensional personality of which you are part.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>但是你还有一个部分，你更深的本体，它形成“内在自我”与“外在自我”，它决定你生存在此时此地。“这”就是你本体的核心，你从中跃出的“心灵种子”，你为其一部分的“多次元人格”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>For those of you who wonder where I place the subconscious, as psychologists think of it, you can imagine it as a meeting place, so to speak, between the outer and inner egos. You must understand that there are no real divisions to the self, however, so we speak of various portions only to make the basic idea clear.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>至于你们那些想知道我将心理学家所谓的潜意识放在哪里的人，你可以想象它是在外在自我与内在自我之间的一个所谓会合之地。不过你必须了解，自己(self)并没有真实的分界，因此我们说到各个不同的部分只是为阐明基本的概念而已。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Since we are addressing individuals who do identify with the “normally conscious self,” I bring such matter up in this first chapter because I will be using the terms later in the book, and because I want to state the fact of multidimensional personality as soon as possible.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>既然我们是在对那些确实认同“正常有意识的自己”的人说话，我在这第一章里便提出这些事情，因为我在书中后来会用到这些名词，也因为我要尽早地声明“多次元人格”这个事实。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You cannot understand yourselves, and you cannot accept my independent existence, until you rid yourself of the notion that personality is a “here and now” attribute of consciousness. Now some of the things that I may say about physical reality in this book may startle you, but remember that I am viewing it from an entirely different standpoint.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“人格”并不是“意识”在“此时此地”的一种属性，你若不能弄清这个观念，便不能了解你自己，也不能接受我独立的存在。虽然在本书我可能会说到有关于物质实相的一些事，可能会令你大为吃惊，但要记住我是站在全然不同的立场来看它的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane paused frequently here as she spoke for Seth. Her eyes were closed often.) You are presently focused entirely within it, wondering perhaps what else if anything there may be outside. I am outside, returning momentarily to a dimension that I know and loved. I am not in your terms a resident, however. While I have a psychic “passport,” there are still some problems of translation, inconveniences of entry that I must contend with.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍在替赛斯讲话时常常停顿，她的眼睛也常常闭着。)你现在是全神贯注在物质实相上，也许在奇怪如果它外面有东西又会是什么呢？我则是在外面，顷刻间回到我熟知并且喜爱的人间，可是我并非你所谓的一个居民。虽然我有一个心灵的“护照”，仍然有些我必须克服的难题，如翻译的问题、进入的不便等。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Many people, I hear, have lived for years within New York City and never taken a tour through the Empire State Building, while many foreigners are well acquainted with it. And so while you have a physical address, I may still be able to point out some very strange and miraculous psychic and psychological structures within your own system of reality that you have ignored.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我听说，许多人在纽约住了多年，连帝国大厦也没参观过，但很多外国人对它倒很熟悉。因此虽然你住在地球上，我仍然可能指出一些被你忽略，但在你们自己的实相系统之中非常奇怪且神奇的心灵与心理结构。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I hope, quite frankly, to do far more than this. I hope to take you on a tour through the levels of reality that are available to you, and to guide you on a journey through the dimensions of your own psychological structure ---- to open up whole areas of your own consciousness of which you have been relatively unaware. I hope, therefore, not only to explain the multidimensional aspects of personality, but to give each reader some glimpse of that greater identity that is his own.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>老实说，我希望做到的还不止于此，我希望能带你游历你所能去的各个层面的实相，引导你游历你自己心理结构的各个次元——打开你自己意识的整个领域，那些你还没怎么知觉到的领域。因此，我希望不止于解释“人”的多次元面貌，还要使每位读者对自己更大的本体略见一斑。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Quietly): You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(安静地：)你可以休息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:07. Jane was out of trance easily and quickly. She had no idea, she said, of her pace, fast or slow, or of the passage of time per se. She said she had the impression that the material from Seth was highly condensed and directed, aimed at the reader, that he was trying to get the ideas across as clearly and concisely as possible.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:07。珍很快很容易回过神来。她说她不知自己的速度是快是慢，也不知过了多少时间。她说她的印像是，赛斯传来的资料非常浓缩，直接瞄准了读者，并且他努力使意念尽量清楚简明地传达过来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane now told me she had been very tired before the session. She resumed in the same manner at 10:29.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍现在才告诉我，她在课开始前就已经很累了。她在10:29以同样的方式继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The self that you know is but one fragment of your entire identity. These fragment selves are not strung together, however, like beads of a string. They are more like the various skins of an onion, or segments of an orange, all connected through the one vitality and growing out into various realities while springing from the same source.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你所知的自己只是你整体的一个片段。可是这些个片段的自己却不是像线上的珠子那样串在一起的。反倒更像洋葱层层的皮、或橘子的瓣，但全都连在一个生命力上，虽然源自同一来源却向外生长到不同的实相中去。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I am not comparing personality to an orange or an onion, but I want to emphasize that as these things grow from within outward, so does each fragment of the entire self. You observe the outside aspect of objects. Your physical senses permit you to perceive the exterior forms to which you then react, but your physical senses to some extent force you to perceive reality in this manner, and the inside vitality within matter and form is not so apparent.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我不是将“人”比为橘子或洋葱，但我要强调，就像这些东西由内向外生长，整个的“我”的每一片段体也是一样。你只观察物体的外貌。你的肉体感官允许你感知外在的样子然后对它起反应，但你的肉体感官到某个程度也迫使你用这种方式来感知实相，而在物质与形式内的内在生命力就不那么明显了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I can tell you, for example, that there is consciousness even within a nail, but few of my readers will take me seriously enough to stop in midsentence, and say good morning or good afternoon to the nearest nail they can find, stuck in a piece of wood.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如，我能告诉你，即使在一支钉子里也有意识，但很少读者会认真看待这句话，马上停下来，向他们能找到的最近一块木头中的钉子道早安或午安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Nevertheless, the atoms and molecules within the nail do possess their own kind of consciousness. The atoms and molecules that make up the pages of this book are also, within their own level, aware. Nothing exists ---- neither rock, mineral, plant, animal, or air ---- that is not filled with consciousness of its own kind.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>无论如何，在钉子内的原子与分子确实拥有它们自己的一种意识。组成这书页的原子与分子在它们自己的层面内也有知觉。没有一样存在的东西——不管是石头、矿物、植物、动物或空气——不是充满了它自己的那种意识的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>So you stand amid a constant vital commotion, a gestalt of aware energy, and you are yourselves physically composed of conscious cells that carry within themselves the realization of their own identity, that cooperate willingly to form the corporeal structure that is your physical body.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此你们都站在一个恒常的盎然生机之中，站在一个有知觉的能量完形之中，而你们自己的肉体也是由有意识的细胞所组成，它们自己的内在带着对自己身份的体认，甘愿合作以形成一个有形的结构，那就是你的肉体。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I am saying, of course, that there is no such thing as dead matter. There is no object that was not formed by consciousness, and each consciousness, regardless of its degree, rejoices in sensation and creativity. You cannot understand what you are unless you understand such matter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当然，我是说没有所谓死的东西。没有东西不是由意识组成，而且不论程度如何，每一种意识都欢喜地享有感觉与创造。除非你了解这种事，否则你就无法理解你是什么。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>For convenience’s sake, you close out the multitudinous inner communications that leap between the tiniest parts of your flesh, yet even as physical creatures, you are to some extent a portion of other consciousnesses. There are no limitations to the self. There are no limitations to its potentials. (Pause.) You can adopt artificial limitations through your own ignorance, however. You can identify, for example, with your outer ego alone, and cut yourself off from abilities that are a part of you. You can deny, but you cannot change, the facts. The personality is multidimensional, even though many people hide their heads, figuratively speaking, in the sand of three-dimensional existence and pretend there is nothing more.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>为了方便起见，你把那些跳过你肉体最细微部分之间的多方面内在沟通关在外面，但即使当你是有肉体的生物时，你在某个程度仍是其他意识的一部分。“自己”是无限的，它的潜能也是无限的。(停顿：)然而，因为你自己的无知，你可能会采取人为的限制。例如，你能单单认同你的外在自我，而与本是你一部分的那些能力切断连结。你能否认事实，却无法改变它。拿驼鸟作个比喻，虽然许多人把他们的头埋在三次元存在的沙中，假装没有更多的次元，人格却的确是多次元的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Humorously): In this book I hope to pull some heads out of the sand. (Long pause.) You may break or end the session as you prefer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(幽默地：)在这本书中我希望把一些头从沙里拉出来。(停顿良久。)你们可以休息或结束这一节，随你高兴。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“We’ll take the break.” 10:59 to 11:10.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我们休息一下。”10:59—11:10。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will shortly be finished with our Chapter One, with very little more to go. (Amused): That is not for the book.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：我们很快就会结束第一章，只剩一点点了。(好玩地：)那不是书的正文。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I do not mean to underestimate the outer ego. You have simply overestimated it. Nor has its true nature been recognized.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我不是要低估外在自我，只是你们太高估它了。它真正的本质也没被体认。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will have more to say concerning this point, but for now it is enough to realize that your sense of identity and continuity is not dependent upon the ego.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>关于这一点我们以后还有话说，但就目前而言，只要你能了解你的身份感与延续感并不依赖自我就够了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now at times I will be using the term “camouflage,” referring to the physical world to which the outer ego relates, for physical form is one of the camouflages that reality adopts. The camouflage is real, and yet there is a much greater reality within it ---- the vitality that gave it form. Your physical senses then allow you to perceive this camouflage, for they are attuned to it in a highly specialized manner. But to sense the reality within the form requires a different sort of attention, and more delicate manipulations than the physical senses provide.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>且说有时我会用到“伪装”(camouflage)这名词，指的是外在自我所涉的物质世界，因为物质外形是实相所采取的一种伪装。这伪装是真的，但它的内在还有一个大得多的实相——一个赋予伪装其形式的“生命力”(vitality)。然后你的肉体感官让你去感知这伪装，因为感官以极为特定的方式与之配合、调频。但要想感觉到那伪装形式内的真相，则需要另一类的注意力及更精微的操纵，这不是肉体感官所能胜任的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The ego is a jealous god, and it wants its interests served. It does not want to admit the reality of any dimensions except those within which it feels comfortable and can understand. It was meant to be an aid but it has been allowed to become a tyrant. Even so, it is much more resilient and eager to learn than is generally supposed. It is not natively as rigid as it seems. Its curiosity can be of great value.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>自我是个善妒的神，它只顾自己的利益。除了那些它在其中觉得自在并能了解的次元以外，自我不想承认任何次元的真实性。自我本来应做个助手，却被纵容成一位暴君。即使如此，它仍比一般所假定的要有弹性得多，而且亟欲学习。它并非生来就像它看起来的那么顽固，它的好奇心可以发挥很大的价值。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If you have a limited conception of the nature of reality, then your ego will do its best to keep you in the small enclosed area of your accepted reality. If, on the other hand, your intuitions and creative instincts are allowed freedom, then they communicate some knowledge of greater dimensions to this most physically oriented portion of your personality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你对实相的本质有一个狭隘的观念，那么你的自我会尽其所能，把你关在你接受的实相当中闭锁的小角落里。反过来说，如果你凭借直觉和创造的本能被给予自由，那么它们会把对更广大次元的知识沟通给你人格最朝向肉体的这一部分。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:35 P.M. The session was interrupted because Rooney, one of our two cats, wanted to go out for the night. Seth had been doing well. Jane left trance quickly. After I let the cat out she waited briefly, then decided to call it an evening before Seth could return. It doesn’t seem that Chapter One is quite finished.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:35。课被我们两只猫之一的隆尼打断了，它要出去过夜。赛斯一直进行得很好。珍很快地回神。在我放猫出去后她等了一会儿，然后在赛斯能回来前她决定今夜到此为止。第一章好像还没完。)</a>
