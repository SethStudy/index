<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“晚安，赛斯”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will resume dictation. (Pause.) Such other existences and realities as just described coexist with your own, and in the waking state you are not aware of them. Now, often in your dreams you are able to perceive such other situations, but you often wind them into dream paraphernalia of your own, in which case upon awakening you have little clear memory.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们将继续口述(停顿)。刚才所形容的那种其他的存在和实相与你现有的共存，而在醒时状态，你对它们不知不觉。其实在你的梦里，你常能感知这种其他的情形，但你常把它们卷入自己的“梦的行头”里，在那情形，当你醒过来时很少有清楚的记忆。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In the same way in the midst of life, you dwell with so-called ghosts and apparitions, and for that matter you yourselves appear as apparitions to others, particularly when you send strong thought forms of yourself from the sleep state, or even when unconsciously you travel out of your physical body.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>同样地，在生活中，你就与所谓的鬼魂与幽灵同住，并且就此点而言，对其他人来说你也看来像是幽灵，尤其是当你在睡眠状态中放出自己强烈的“心念形相”时，或甚至当你无意识地游出体外时。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are obviously as many kinds of ghosts and apparitions as there are people. They are as alert or as unalert to their situation as you are to your own. They are not fully focused in physical reality, however, either in personality or in form, and this is their main distinction. Some apparitions are thought forms sent by survival personalities out of lingering deep anxiety. They portray the same compulsive-type behavior that can be seen in many instances in your ordinary experience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>显然鬼和幽灵的种类之多，就如人的种类之多一样，他们也和你们一样，对自己的境遇有的很警觉有的不警觉。可是，不论就人格或形体而言，他们并不完全聚焦于物质实相中，这是他们最大的不同点。有一些幽灵是幸存的人由于留连不去的深度焦虑而放出的“念力形相”，它们表现出与你们日常经验中常见的同样强迫性举动。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The same mechanism that causes a disturbed woman, say, to perform repetitive action such as a constant washing and rewashing of hands, also causes a particular kind of apparition to return time and time again to one place. In such cases the behavior is often composed of repetitive action.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好比说，促使一个心神困扰的妇人去重复一项行为——比如不断地把手洗了又洗——的相同机制，也引起某一种幽灵一再地回到同一地点。在此种情形，那举动通常是由重复的动作组成的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>For various reasons, such a personality has not learned to assimilate its own experience. The characteristics of such apparitions follow those of a disturbed personality ---- with some exceptions, however. The whole consciousness is not present. The personality itself seems to be having a nightmare, or a series of recurring dreams, during which it returns to the physical environment. The personality itself is “safe and sound,” but certain portions of it work out unresolved problems, and discharge energy in such a fashion.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>为了各种理由，这样的一个人格还没学会消化吸收其经验。这种幽灵的特征与被困扰的人一样——不过，有一些例外。整个的意识并不在场。这人格的本身似乎是在作一场恶梦，或一连串一再重复的梦，在梦中它回到了物质环境。那人格的本身是“安全且健全”的，但它的某个部分在解决尚未解决的问题，而以此种方式放出能量来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:44.) They are in themselves quite harmless. Only your interpretation of their actions can cause difficulties. Now in the middle of life, of life conditions, you also appear on occasion as ghosts in other levels of reality, where your “pseudo appearance” causes some comment and is the ground for many myths ---- and you are not even aware of this.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:44)他们本身是相当无害的。只是你对它们行为的“诠释”可能会引起问题。其实在生活中，在生活的情况中，你也偶尔在实相的其他层面以鬼魂的样子出现。在那儿你的“假象”引起一些评论，且是许多神话的依据——而你却不知不觉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now I am speaking generally. Again, there are exceptions where memory is retained, but as a rule ghosts and apparitions are not any more aware of their effect upon others than you are when you appear quite unconsciously as ghosts in worlds that would be quite strange to you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我现在是一般地说。再次的，在有些例外里记忆仍保留着，但一般而言，鬼和幽灵对他们给别人的印象，并不比当你相当无意识地在很陌生的世界中出现为鬼魂时更有知觉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The combination of) thought, emotion, and desire creates form, possesses energy, (and) is made of energy. It will show itself in as many ways as possible. You only recognize the physical materializations, but as mentioned earlier in this book, you send pseudoforms of yourself out from yourself of which you are not aware; and this is completely aside from the existence of astral travel or projection, which is a much more complicated affair.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>思想、情感和欲望[合起来]创造了形相，拥有能量，[并且是]由能量造成。它将以尽可能多的方式显示自己。你只认识具体的肉身，但如此书先前提过的，你不知不觉地放出自己的假象；这与灵体旅行(astral travel)或投射完全不是一回事，那是复杂得多的事。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You appear in astral form in realities that are comparatively more advanced than your own. You are usually recognized because of your disorientation. You do not know how to manipulate. (Humorously): You do not know the customs. But whether you have a physical form or not, if you have emotions or feelings, these will take form. They have a reality. If you think strongly of an object, somewhere it will appear.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你以灵体形式出现的实相比人间进步得多。你往往是因为迷失方向而被认了出来。你不知该如何操纵。(幽默地：)你不知道“民俗”。但不管你有没有肉体，如果你有感情或感觉，这些会有形相，它们会有一个实相。如果你很强烈地想一件东西，它会在某处出现。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If you think strongly of being in another location, a pseudoimage of yourself will be projected out from you to that place, whether or not it is perceived and whether or not you yourself are conscious of it, or conscious in it. This applies (both) to those who have left your physical system and to those who are in it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你极想在另一个地点，你的一个假象将会被投射到那个地方，不论它有没有被别人感知，不论你自己对它有没有意识到，或你的意识是否在它内。这对那些已离开你们的物质系统及仍在其内的人一样适用。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:55.) All of these forms are called Secondary constructions, for as a rule full consciousness of the personality is not in them. They are automatic projections.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:55)所有这些形相都叫做次级构造物(secondary construction)，因为一般而言，人格的全部意识并不在其内。它们是自动的投射物。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, in primary constructions, a consciousness, usually fully aware and alert, adopts a form ---- not his “native” one ---- and consciously projects it, often into another level of reality. Even this is a rather complicated endeavor, and one seldom used for purposes of communication.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，在主要构造物(primary construction)里，一个意识，通常在完全有知觉和警醒的情形下，采取了一个形相——非他“天生的”那个——有意识的把它投射，常常是投射到另一个实相层面中。即使这件工作也是相当复杂的，很少为了沟通的目的而这样做。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are other much easier methods. I have explained to some degree the way images are constructed out of an available field of energy. You perceive only your own constructions. If a “ghost” wants to contact you therefore, he can do so through telepathy, and you can yourself construct the corresponding image if you desire. Or the individual might send you a thought form at the same time that he telepathically communicates with you. Your rooms are full now of thought forms that you do not perceive; and again, you are as much a ghostly phenomenon now as you will be after death. You are simply not aware of the fact.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有其他容易得多的方法。我曾多少解释过，由一可用的能量场来构建形相的方式。你只知觉自己的构造物。因此，如果一个“鬼魂”想要与你联络，他可以透过心电感应去做，如果你想做，你也可以构建那相应的形相。或者他在与你心电感应地通讯的同时，可以送给你一个“心念形相”。你们的房间里现在满是你不感知的“心念形相”；再说一次，你现在与你死后一样的是个鬼也似的现象。你只是对这事实不知不觉罢了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You ignore certain temperature variations and stirrings of air as imagination, that are instead indicative of such thought forms. You thrust into the background telepathic communications that often accompany such forms, and you turn aside from all clues that other realities exist quite validly with your own, and that in the midst of one existence you are surrounded by intangible but valid evidence. The very words “life” and “death” serve to limit your understanding, to set up barriers where none intrinsically exist.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你忽视某些温度的变化与空气的骚动，以为是你的想象，它们其实是这种“心念形相”的指示。你把常常伴随这种形象的心电感应通讯抛到背后，你不顾所有那些线索，它们指出其他实相是十分有效地与你的实相一同存在，在你一生当中，你被看不见却有效的证据所包围。“生”与“死”这些字眼的本身就限制了你的了解，在本来没有障碍的地方树立了障碍。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:07. Jane was easily out of trance. Her delivery this evening was a bit different than usual. Her voice was quiet, almost conversational in manner and pace, although the speed varied at times. Resume in the same way at 10:18.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:07。珍很轻易地脱离了出神状态。她今晚的情绪与往常略有不同。她的声音很轻，在态度与步调上几乎像是闲谈，虽然有时速度会变化。在10:18以同样方式继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Some dead friends and relatives do visit you, projecting from their own level of reality into yours, but you cannot as a rule perceive their forms. They are not more ghostly, or “dead,” however, than you are when you project into their reality ---- as you do, from the sleep state.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些已逝的朋友和亲人真的会来拜访你，由他们的实相层面投射进你的，但一般而言，你无法感知他们的形相。不过，他们并不比你在投射入他们的实相时——如你在睡眠状态中所作的——更像鬼，或更“死”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As a rule, however, they can perceive you on those occasions. What you often forget is that such individuals are in various stages of development. Some have stronger connections to the physical system than others. The length of time an individual has been dead in your terms has little to do with whether or not you will be so visited, but rather the intensity of the relationship.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，一般而言，在那些场合他们能够感知你。你常常会忘了这种“人”是在各种不同的发展阶段，其中有些比另一些跟物质系统有较强的联系。以你们的用语来说，他会不会来拜访你与他已死了多久没有多大关系，而是与你们之间的关系的强烈程度有关。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As mentioned earlier, however, in the sleep state you may help recently dead persons, complete strangers, to ac climate to after-death conditions, even though this knowledge is not available to you in the morning. So others, strangers, may communicate with you when you are sleeping, and even guide you through various periods of your life.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，如先前提过的，在睡眠状态你可以帮助新逝者，完全的陌生人，去适应死后情形，虽然早上醒来你不会知道这事。因此其他的人、陌生的人在你睡时可能与你沟通，甚至会在你一生的各个时期指导你。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我It is not a simple matter to explain life conditions as you know them, so it is extremely difficult to discuss the complexities of which you are not aware.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>对你解释你所知的生活情形已非易事，因此，跟你讨论你不知觉的复杂事件更是极其困难。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The main point I want to make in this chapter is that you are already familiar with all conditions you will meet after death, and you can become consciously aware of these to some extent. (Pause, smile at 10:29.) End of chapter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这一章里我要说明的重点是：你对你死后将遇到的所有情形都已经熟悉了，而且你在某范围内能变得有意识地知觉到这些情形。(微笑，在10:29停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Give us a moment.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这章结束了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>CHAPTER 11</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：等我们一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>AFTER-DEATH CHOICES AND THE MECHANICS OF TRANSITION</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第十一章 死后的选择与过渡的机制</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are unlimited varieties of experience open to you after death, all possible, but some less probable than others, according to your development. Very generally now, there are three main areas, though exceptions and extraordinary cases can take other roads.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在死后，有无限形形色色的经验对你开放，全都是可能的，但按照你的发展，有一些经验比其他的可能性高些。非常一般性地说，有三种主要的范围，虽然例外和特例可能走别的路子。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may decide upon another reincarnation. You may decide to focus instead upon your past life, using it as the stuff of new experience, as mentioned previously creating variations of events as you have known them, making corrections as you choose. Or you may enter another system of probability entirely; and this is quite apart from a reincarnational existence. You will be leaving all thoughts of continuity of time behind you in such a case.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可能决定再投胎一次。相反的，你可能决定聚焦于你的前生，用它作为新经验的素材，如前面提过的创造你所知事件的种种变化，依你的选择来作些改正。或者你可能完全进入另一个“可能系统”(system of probability)；这与转世投胎十分不同。在这种情形，你将会超越所有“时间是连续的”的想法。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now some individuals, some personalities, prefer a life organization bound about past, present, and future in a seemingly logical structure, and these persons usually choose reincarnation. Others naively prefer to experience events in an extraordinarily intuitive manner, with the organization being provided by the associative processes. These will choose a system of Probabilities for their next main endeavor.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些“人”，有些人格，比较喜欢一种把过去、现在与未来围在一个似乎合逻辑结构里的生活组织，这些人通常会选择转世。另一些人天生较偏好以不寻常的直觉方式来体验事件，而由联想过程来提供组织。这些“人”会选择一个“可能系统”为他们下一个主要努力的目标。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Some simply find the physical system not to their liking, and in such a way take leave of it. This cannot be done, however, until the reincarnational cycle, once chosen, is completed, so the last choice exists for those who have developed their abilities through reincarnation as far as possible within that system.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些“人”只是发觉物质系统不合自己的胃口，就这样脱离了它。不过，一旦选择了转世轮回，则一直要等到轮回已经完成，这才能做到，因此只有那些经由转世而已在那系统中尽情发展了他们能力的人，才能作这种选择。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Some, finished with reincarnation, may choose to reenter the cycle acting as teachers, and in such cases some recognition of higher identity is always present. Now there is an in-between stage of relative indecision, a midplane of existence; a rest area, comparatively speaking, and it is from this area that most communication from relatives occurs. This is usually the level that is visited by the living in projections from the dream state.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些“人”，结束了转世，可能选择再进入轮回中作为老师，在这种情形，他对自己更高的本体总有一些认识。还有一种比较犹豫不决的中间阶段，存在的中间层面；比较来说，那是一个休息地带，亲人的通讯也最常来自这地带。活着的人在梦境投射时所拜访的也往往是这个层面。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:45 to 10:54.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:45—10:54。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Before the time of choosing, however, there is a period of self-examination, and your full “history” becomes available to you. You understand the nature of the entity, and you are advised by other portions of that entity, more “advanced” than yourself.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，在选择的时间之前，还有一段自我检讨时期，你可以得到你全部的“历史”。你了解了“存有”的本质，而“存有”的其他比你“进步”的部分会给你劝告。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You will become aware of your other reincarnational selves, for example. There will be emotional ties with other personalities whom you have known in past lives, and some of these may supersede your relationships in the immediately past life. This is a meeting place for individuals from your own system also, however.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如，你将知觉到其他转世的自己。你与累世相识的人也会有情感上的联系，其中有些关系可能会取代你在最近一次前生中的关系。可是，那里也是由你自己系统里来的人的会合处。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>All necessary explanations are given to those who are disoriented. Those who do not realize that they are dead are here told of their true condition, and all efforts are made to refresh the energies and spirits. It is a time of study and comprehension. It is from this area that some disturbed personalities have those dreams of returning to the physical environment.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>对迷失方向的人，会给予所有必需的解释。那些不知自己已死的人在此地被告以其真实情况，并且尽可能地帮助他们恢复能量和精神。这是一个研习和理解的时候。就是由这个地带，有些失常的“人”有了那些回到物质环境的梦。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It is a place of commerce between systems, so to speak. Conditions and development are important, rather than the length an individual stays in this area. It is an intermediary step, but an important one. In your dreams you have been here.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可以说这是个系统与系统之间的交会场所。一个人在此地的情形和发展，比他逗留时间的长短更重要。这是过渡的一步，却是重要的一步。你在梦中曾到过这里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: End of dictation. I wanted to end one chapter and begin another. I will close the session unless you have questions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：口述完毕。我想只是结束上一章而开始这一章。除非你有问题，否则我就结束此节。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I guess not.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我想没有。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>My heartiest wishes to you both, and a fond good evening</a>
<a id=1 href=1>给你俩我最衷心的祝福，晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good night, Seth, and thank you very much.” 11:05 P.M.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。非常谢谢你。”11:05。)</a>
