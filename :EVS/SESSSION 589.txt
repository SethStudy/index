<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 588,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第588节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>AUGUST 2, 1971, 9:01 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年8月2日 星期一 晚上9：01</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane and I each noted questions before the session this evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在今晚的课之前，珍和我各自记下了想问的问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(In the 586th session, earlier in this chapter, Seth stated that by the year 2075 the third Christ ---- Paul or Saul ---- would have enacted the Second Coming, exerting of course a profound effect upon religion and world history. Jane thought a period of less than a century was much too short a time to encompass so many dramatic changes. She wanted me to ask Seth if she had distorted this data while delivering it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在这章的前头，第586节里，赛斯说，到了公元2075年，第三位基督——保罗或扫罗——将演出“基督再临”，自然会对宗教与世界产生一个更深远的影响。珍认为不到一个世纪的一段时间却包含了这么多的戏剧性转变，是太短促了些。她要我问赛斯是否她在传述时曲解了这资料。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(When, for instance, would the personality be born, in order to have time to bring about such tremendous changes? We supposed there was a chance distortion had occurred.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(例如，这人格在何时出生才会有时间带来这么巨大的改变？我们假定有发生了一个扭曲的可能性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(My questions concerned relationships between the three personalities of the Christ entity: John the Baptist, Jesus Christ, and Paul. What sort of psychic interactions had taken place between them in any strong or exceptional way? Were their dreams and other psychic experiences ---- other than the recorded instances ---- outstanding on a regular basis as they lived out their lives day by day?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我的问题是关于基督存有的三个人格——施洗约翰、基督与保罗——之间的关系。在他们之间发生过何种心灵的相互作用？是否以强烈或特殊的方式发生？当他们一天一天地过活时，他们的梦与其他的心灵经验——除了记录下来的例子外——是否经常是不同凡响的？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(All of the following historical dates are quite approximate, but they show the overlapping pattern of the physical lives of the three personalities making up the Christ entity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(所有以下的历史性日期都是相当概略的，但它们显示了在三个组成基督存有者的人世生活之间互相重叠的模式。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(John the Baptist was born between 8 and 4 B.C., and died in A.D. 26 to 27. Jesus Christ was born between 8 and 5 B.C., and died in A.D. 29 to 30. Paul [Saul] of Tarsus was born between A.D. 5 and 15 and died in A.D. 67 to 68.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(施洗约翰生于公元前8年到4年之间，而死于公元26到27年。耶稣生于公元前8年到5年，而死于公元29到30年。塔色斯(Tarsus)的保罗〔扫罗〕生于公元5到10年，而死于公元67到68年。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, was a cousin of Christ’s mother, Mary. John baptized Christ at the beginning of his ministry in A.D. 26 to 27, when he was about thirty. John was already active in his own ministry, and often called himself a “forerunner of one who would be nobler and stronger.” Shortly after he baptized Jesus, John was imprisoned by Herod Antipas in the fortress Machaerus, near the Dead Sea.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(施洗约翰的母亲，伊丽莎白，是基督的母亲玛利亚的表姐。公元26到27年，约翰在基督开始其传教工作时给祂施洗，祂时年约三十。当时约翰已很积极的从事他自己的传教工作，常称他自己为“一个更高贵更强的人之先锋”。在他给基督施洗后不久，被黑洛德·安提帕斯囚禁在死海附近的马加鲁斯堡。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(It isn’t known for sure that Christ and Paul ever met. Paul was converted several years after Christ’s death; before that he had been a zealous persecutor of Christians. Nor does it appear that John and Paul met.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(基督与保罗是否曾碰过面还不能确定。在基督死后几年保罗皈依了；在那之前他曾是一个狂热的迫害基督徒的人。约翰与保罗也不像曾见过面。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(According to history, all three members of the Christ entity met violent ends. Christ was crucified near Jerusalem at the order of Pontius Pilate; Herod had John beheaded; and Paul was beheaded near Rome during the reign of Nero.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(按照历史记载，基督存有的三个人都遭到横死。庞提阿斯·拉多下令在耶路撒冷附近把基督钉死在十字架上；希律下令砍了约翰的头；而保罗则在尼禄治下的罗马附近被砍头。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Readers of The Seth Material had asked Seth to elaborate upon data of the three Christs given in Chapter Eighteen, “The God Concept,” of that book. Some wanted to know if one of the three Christs could have been the Teacher of Righteousness; this personage was the leader of the Zealot sect in Judaea early in the first century A.D. There were four known Jewish sects flourishing there at the birth of Christianity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(《灵界的讯息》的读者曾请赛斯详细说明在那本书第十八章〈神的观念〉中所给的三位基督资料。有些人想知道是否三位基督中之一可能曾是“正义教师”(Teacher of Rigteousness)；这个人物早在公元后1世纪，曾是犹地亚“狂热派”的领袖。在基督教诞生时曾有四种知名的犹太教派在那儿盛行。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Other questions concerned a variety of names for Christ himself. Jane and I had been saving these, and we went over them now before the session. Jane’s pace as the session opened was quite a bit slower than usual.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(其他的问题是基督关乎本人的各种不同名称。珍和我保存了这些问题，现在我们在课前看了一遍。在课开始时，珍的步调比平时要慢很多。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Give us a moment, and we will resume.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>请等我们一会儿，我们就会继续。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In any given historical period, one religious drama may finally emerge as the exterior representation, but there will also be many minor dramas, “projections,” that do not entirely take. These represent, of course, probable events. Any of them could supersede the actual exterior drama. In the time of Christ there were many such performances, as many personalities felt the force of inner reality and reacted to it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在任何一个特定的历史时期，一个宗教剧可能终于浮露出来作为外在的代表，但也有许多次要的戏剧——“投射”——没有全然被采用。自然，这些代表了可能的事件。它们之中的任何一个都可以取代那实际的外在戏剧。在基督的时代有很多这种演出，因为许多人感到内在实相的力量而对之反应。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There were probable Christs, in other words, living in your terms at that time. For several reasons that I will not go into here, these projections did not mirror inner events faithfully enough. There were, however, a score of men in the same general area, physically, who responded to the inner psychic climate and felt upon themselves the attraction and responsibility of the religious hero.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>换言之，有“可能的基督”以你们的说法在那时生活着。为了几个我不欲在此深入的理由，这些投射没能足够忠实地反映内在事件。不过，在大致相同的地区里，有二十来人对内在的心灵气候反应，而亲身感受到作“宗教英雄”的吸引力与责任。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:09.) Some of these men were too tinged, too caught in the torment and fervor of the period to rise sufficiently above it. The cultures used them. They could not use the various cultures as launching ground for the new ideas. Instead they became lost in the history of the times.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:09停顿。)他们中有些太被那时期的痛苦与热诚所感染、羁绊而未能超越它。那些文化利用了他们。他们无法利用各种文化作为新概念的发射台，反而失落在那时的历史里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Some carried on following the same pattern taken by Christ, performed psychic feats and healings, had groups of followers, and yet were not capable of holding that powerful focus of psychic attention that was so necessary.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些追随着基督采用的模式，继续表演灵异事迹与疗愈，也有一群群的信徒，但却没有能力像基督那样，心灵焦点集中，威力强大。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The Lord of Righteousness, so called, was such a person, but his over-zealous nature held him back.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>所谓的“正义之主”(Lord of Righteousness)，就是这样的一个人，但他过分狂热的天性妨碍了他。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(In the literature I’ve been reading on the subject, the Zealot leader was always called the Teacher of Righteousness. The interpretation of scanty records, including the Dead Sea Scrolls, has given rise to debate, but it appears he was either Menahem ben Judah, who was killed in A.D. 66 in Jerusalem, or a nephew, who survived and succeeded him.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在我所读过的有关这个主题书里，“狂热教派”的领袖总是被称为“正义教师”。对包括了《死海经卷》稀少记录的诠释，引起了争论，但看起来他或是在公元66年左右在耶路撒冷被杀的Menahem ben julah，或是幸存而继承了他的一个侄子。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>His rigidity prevented the spontaneity necessary for any true great religious release. He fell, instead, into the trap of provincialism. Had he performed the role possible, he could have been of benefit to Paul. He was a probable personality of the Paul portion of the Christ entity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他的僵化阻止了任何真正伟大的宗教性释放所必须的自发性，反而跌入了乡土主义的陷阱。如果他扮演好那个可能的角色，他可以有助于保罗。他是基督存有里的保罗部分的一个可能人格。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause at 9:17. Jane’s pace was still quite slow.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:17停顿良久。珍的步调仍相当慢。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>These men innately understood their part in this drama, and also their position within All That Is. They were all highly clairvoyant and telepathic, given to visions and hearing of voices.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这些人天生就了解他们在这场戏中的角色，以及他们在“一切万有”内的地位。他们全都极有千里眼与心电感应的能力，能看到幻相及听到声音。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In their dreams they were in contact. Consciously Paul remembered many of these dreams, until he felt pursued by Christ. It was because of a series of recurring dreams that Paul persecuted the Christians. He felt that Christ was a kind of devil who pursued him in his sleep.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他们在梦中有所接触。保罗有意识地记得许多个这种梦，直到他感到被基督追逼为止。就因为一连串重复的梦，保罗才迫害基督徒。他觉得基督是在他睡觉时追逐他的一种魔鬼。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>On an unconscious level, however, he knew the meaning of the dreams, and his “conversion,” of course, was only a physical event following an inner experience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，在一个无意识层面，他明白这些梦的意义。而他的“皈依”，当然只是一个追随内在经验的具体事件而已。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>John the Baptist, Christ, and Paul were all connected in the dream state, and John was well aware of Christ’s existence before Christ was born.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>施洗约翰、基督与保罗都在梦境里相连，在基督尚未出生之前，约翰早已觉知基督的存在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Paul needed the strongest egotistical strength because of his particular duties. He was far less aware consciously of his role for this reason. The inner knowledge, of course, exploded in the physical conversion experience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因为他特殊的责任，保罗需要最强的自我中心力量。为此之故，他对他的角色较少有意识上的觉察。自然，这内在知识在实际的“皈依”经验里爆发出来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This material has been given in answer to your questions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这资料是为了回答你们的问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“It’s very interesting.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“很有意思。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane took a long pause at 9:25. Still in trance, she lit a cigarette and sipped a drink.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:25珍停了很久。仍在出神状态里，她点了支烟并喝了一点饮料。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now in answer to Ruburt’s question: The birth will occur at the time given; by the time given (the year 2075). The other changes will occur generally over the period of a century, but the results will show far before that time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在来回答鲁柏的问题：那诞生将在我所给的时间发生；在所给的时间内(公元2075年)发生。其他的改变大致发生在一个世纪的时间内，但其结果早在那时以前就显示出来了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Because of the plastic nature of the future, in your terms, the date cannot be considered final. All Probabilities point in its direction, however, for the inner impetus is already forming the events.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因为你们所谓的“未来”可塑性，那个日期不能被认为是确定的。不过，所有的可能性都指向它的方向，因为内在的原动力已在形成这些事件。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Unless you have other questions, that is the end of the chapter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>除非你还有别的问题，本章就到此结束。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“As a matter of curiosity: can you say how the Teacher of Righteousness met his end?” This is one of the questions correspondents have asked.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“为了好奇之故，你能说出‘正义教师’是如何死的吗？”这是来信的人所问的一个问题。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Give us a moment.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>请等一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The name given was correct, though it is itself a translation. He died with a small group of men in a cave that he held as a point of refuge in the middle of a battle, killed by members of another sect. The murderers took with them certain manuscripts that they found there; but others they did not find, and these have not as yet come to light.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我所给的名字是正确的，虽然它本身是个译名。在一次战斗里，他把一个山洞当作避难所，他与一小群人在那儿，被另一派的人所杀。杀人者带走了他们在那儿找到的某些文稿；但他们没找到其他的，而这些尚未出土。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The final place of refuge was near Damascus. For some time the Lord of Righteousness tried to hide himself within the city. His identity was discovered, however, and he and a band of men took to caves that were between Damascus and another nearby town, much smaller, that had been used at one time as a fortress. They were heading there.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那最后的避难所靠近大马士革。有一段时间“正义之主”试着隐藏在那城里。可是他的身份被发现了，他和一队人逃到大马士革与小得多的一个邻镇之间的山洞里，有一阵子那山洞曾被用作堡垒。他们在那儿被斩首。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break, and then I will begin the next chapter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息；然后我要开始下一章。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:35. But instead of taking a break, Jane sat quietly, still in trance.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:35。但珍并没休息，只安静地坐着，仍在出神状态里。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>One small note for those interested. The Zealots, the sect, were also divided into two main groups, one splitting finally from the other main one. Other documents will be found that will clear several important matter concerning the historical times. (Pause.) During one short period of his life, Paul joined a Zealot group. This is unknown. It has not been recorded.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>为那些有兴趣的人加一个小注。“狂热派”也分成两个主要团体，其一终于由另一主要团体中分裂出来。将来会找到的其他文件，将会澄清有关历史时代几件重要的事。(停顿。)保罗一生中有个短时期参加了一个“狂热派”团体。这是人所不知的。它没被记录下来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane sat in trance so long that I began to ask a question; but then she raised a hand to indicate that I wait.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍坐在出神状态这么久，以致我又开始问一个问题；但是她举起一只手叫我等。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In fact, for a period he led a double life as a member of the Zealots. He turned against them vehemently, however, as he was later to turn against the Romans to join the Christians. Before his conversion, he knew he had a purpose and mission, and flung himself with all the passion of his being into whatever answers he thought he had found.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>事实上，有一个时期，作为“狂热派”的一员，他过着双重生活。不过，他转而激烈地反对他们，就如他后来转而反对罗马人而加入基督徒。在他皈依之前，他知道自己有个目的与任务，而以生命的所有热情，把自己投入他以为他找到了的不管什么答案。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:40. Jane’s pace had been slow to begin, but had picked up as her delivery progressed. Her trance had been deep. She said she “really went out when Seth started in on the biblical data.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:40。珍的步调开始时很慢，在她的传述进行时增快了。她的出神状态很深，她说：“在赛斯开始讲圣经资料时，我真的出去了。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I was finding Seth’s information intensely interesting. It was unavoidable in many cases, but Jane said she much preferred not to know anything about the historical period Seth would be discussing. She hadn’t read anything about the Dead Sea Scrolls, for instance, although I’d explained a little about them to her at various times. Nor is she familiar with the Bible.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我发现赛斯的资讯极为有意思。虽然在许多情形那是无法避免的，但珍说她情愿不知道关于赛斯将要讨论的历史时期的任何事。例如，她没读过有关《死海经卷》的任何东西，虽然我在几次不同的时候对她解释过一点点。她对圣经也不熟。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Of course, we hadn’t known just how Seth was going to present his material in the chapter on religion on the third Christ and related data. Both of us were surprised to hear him declare a connection between Paul and the Zealots. Many questions automatically came to our minds; but we had to stop somewhere, so we reluctantly decided not to ask them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(自然，我们以前并不知道，赛斯在谈宗教的一章里将如何提出他对第三位基督及相关事情的资料。我俩听到他宣称保罗与“狂热派”的关联都很惊讶。我们心中自动涌现了许多问题；但我们必须告一段落才行，因此我们勉强决定不去问那些问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane’s attitude about biblical history is in keeping with her feelings about some other facets of her abilities: she has often told me she felt much freer giving a reading for a person when she wasn’t acquainted with him. The same was true when she was trying for the contents of sealed envelopes. She preferred not to know who had prepared them, or their origin, etc.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍对圣经历史抱持了与她对自己一些其他能力一致的态度；她常告诉我，当她为一位素不相识的人解答一些疑难时，她感到自由得多。当她试着猜封起的信封里的内容时也是这样，她情愿不知道是谁准备的，或它们的来源等等。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>CHAPTER 22 A GOODBYE AND AN INTRODUCTION: ASPECTS OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL PERSONALITY AS VIEWED THROUGH MY OWN EXPERIENCE</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第二十二章 辞别和引介：由我自己的经验来看多次元人格的种种面貌</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Resume at 10:00. Jane’s voice, as Seth, was a little different from usual. More controlled, perhaps, not quite as jovial or as much at ease.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:00继续，珍的声音，作为赛斯，与通常略有不同。也许是更抑制的，不是那么快活或那么轻松。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will begin the next chapter, and we will call it: “A Good-bye and an Introduction: Aspects of Multidimensional Personality as Viewed Through My Own Experience.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在，我们要开始下一章，我们将名之为〈辞别和引介：由我自己的经验来看多次元人格的种种面貌〉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“That’s all in the chapter heading?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“那些全在此章的标题里吗？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Yes, a colon to separate the two divisions. And give us a moment. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>是的，用一个冒号分开这两部分。请等我们一会儿。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In the historical time of Christ, I was a man called Millenius, in Rome. In that life my main occupation was that of a merchant, but I was a highly curious gentleman, and my travels gave me access to many different groups of people.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在历史上的基督时代，我在罗马是个名叫米兰尼鄂斯的男人。在那一生，我主要的职业是个商贾，但我是个非常好奇的绅士，而我的旅游使我接触到许多种不同的社交圈。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Physically I was round and stout, not at all patrician in my bearing, and given to untidiness in my dress. We had a type of snuff made from a certain kind of straw. I used it constantly, often spilling some upon my robe.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>身体上我是圆而壮的，举止上毫无贵族派头，而衣着上则邋遢惯了。我们有一种由某种干草做的鼻烟。我经常用它，常常溅了一些在我的袍子上。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>My house was in the busiest, northwestern part of the city, just beyond what you would call the heart of town. Among my wares I sold bells for donkeys. This may not sound like a very grand product, and yet families on the farms outside of Rome found these highly useful. Each had a special sound, and a family could tell by the sound of the bell their own donkey from innumerable similar ones.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我的房子在城西北部最热闹的地方，刚过了你们所谓的市中心。在我贩卖的货物里有驴子用的铃铛。这听起来可能不像是很伟大的产品，但在罗马城外的农家却发现它们极有用处。每个铃都有一个特别的声音，而一个农家可以根据铃的声音，从无数相像的驴子中认出他们自己的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:08.) Donkeys were also used in many businesses within Rome itself as carriers of burden, particularly in the lower occupations. The number of bells, their particular pitch, even the colors, all had meaning. In the tumult of the city the particular bells could be recognized, therefore, by the poor and by the slaves who waited to buy products ---- often wilted foods from the laden carts.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:08)在罗马城内，许多行业也用驴子来驮负重物，尤其在较低贱的行业里。铃铛的数目，它们特殊的高低音调，甚至其色彩，全都有意义。因此，等着购物的穷人和奴隶，在城市的喧嚣中能凭特定的铃声辨认要买的东西——常是来自堆满了东西的驴车上不新鲜的食物。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The bells were only a small portion of my business, which dealt largely with cloths and dyes, but they fascinated me. Because of my interest in them I did far more traveling about the countryside and the region than any prudent man should. The bells became my hobby. My curiosity drove me to journey in search of different kinds of bells, and led me into contact with many people I would not otherwise have encountered.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我主要是做布匹和染料生意，铃铛只是我生意的一小部分，但它们令我着迷。由于我对它们的兴趣，我在乡间附近一带旅行得比任何一个谨慎的人所该做的更多。铃铛变成了我的嗜好。我的好奇心驱使我去旅行以寻找不同类的铃铛，并且导致我与许多本来不会碰到的人接触。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:11.) While I was not literate, I was shrewd and lively of mind. Special bells, I discovered, were used by various sects of Jews, both within Rome and without. While I was a Roman and a citizen, my citizenship meant little except for providing me with minimal safety as I went about my daily way, and in my business I encountered as many Jews as Romans. I was not too far above them socially. (This was Seth’s first bit of humor in the chapter.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:11)虽然我没有学识，却很精明，脑筋也灵活。我发现在罗马城内或城外不同的犹太教派，都各用特殊的铃铛。虽然我是个罗马人也是一个公民，但我的公民身份对我并没什么意义，除了在我忙着日常生活时给了我最起码的安全。而在我的生意里，我碰到的犹太人与罗马人一样多，我在社会地位上比他们高不了多少。(这是此章中赛斯第一次的幽默点滴。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The Romans had no clear idea of the number of Jews in Rome at that time. They went by guesswork. The bells on donkeys belonging to the Zealots had upon them the symbol of an eye (Jane, as Seth, pointed to one of her eyes). They came secretly into town, hiding as much from other Jews as from Romans. They were good bargainers and often did me out of more than I deserved to lose.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>罗马人对当时在罗马城内犹太人的数目不太清楚。他们靠猜测。属于“狂热派”的驴子所挂的铃铛上有一个眼睛符号。(珍，身为赛斯，指着她的一只眼。)他们偷偷进城，躲开其他犹太人就像躲罗马人一样。他们很擅长讨价还价，常常使我亏得比我该亏的还多。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I learned about the Lord of Righteousness from a cousin of his named Sheraba ?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我从“正义之主”的一个叫雪拉巴的堂兄弟那儿知道有关他的事——</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Can you spell that?” Seth did so, and it turned out that our versions agreed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“你能拼出那个字吗？”赛斯拼了，结果与我所写的相同。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(It can be seen from the above paragraphs that Seth shifts his physical location from Rome to Judaea without saying just how or when he did so. I wanted to know more about the mechanics of the transfer but decided not to interrupt further just now.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(由以上几段里可看出，赛斯将其肉身的位置由罗马移到了犹地亚，却没有说他如何或何时这样做的。我想要知道他搬迁的办法，但决定现在不再多插嘴。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>? who was, as clearly as I could figure out at the time, a “sacred” assassin. He was drunk the night I spoke to him in a stinking stall outside of Jerusalem. It was he who told me about the symbol of the eye. He also told me that the man, Christ, was kidnapped by the Essenes. I did not believe him. Nor at the time he told me did I know who Christ was.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>就我当时的猜测，雪拉巴是一个所谓“神圣的”(sacred)杀手。我在耶路撒冷外的一个臭驴厩里和他说话的那晚，他喝醉了。就是他告诉我关于那眼睛的符号。他也告诉我那人，基督，被艾赛尼派(Essenes)的人绑架了。我不相信他。而在他告诉我的时候，我也不知道基督是谁。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:28. Jane’s pace had been slow. The four major Jewish sects known to flourish in the Holy Land at the beginning of the first century were the Sadducees, the Pharisees, the Zealots and the Essenes.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:28停顿。珍的步调一直很慢。据知，盛行于第一世纪开始时的“圣地”的四个主要犹太教派是Sadducees、Pharisees、Zealots及Essenes。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>At the time that Christ lived his existence was known to very few, comparatively speaking. To put it bluntly (and humorously) I knew that someone had the ball, but I was not certain of the person. In dream states, the situation finally became known to me and to many others.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>比较说来，在基督活着时只有极少的人知道他的存在。坦白地(也是幽默地)说，我知道有个人是主角，但我不确知是谁。在梦里，这情况终于被我和许多别人知道了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The Christians, generally speaking, did not want Roman converts. I was later one of these, and because of my nationality was never trusted. My part in that drama was simply to acquaint myself with its physical foundation; to be a participant, however small, in that era. Much later in your terms I would end up as a minor pope in the third century, meeting again some of those I had known ---- and, if you will forgive a humorous note, once more familiar with the sound of bells.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>一般而言，基督徒并不要罗马籍的皈依者。后来我是其中之一，而因为我的国籍，我从来没被信任过。我在那出戏里的角色只不过使我认识了它在世上的基础；在那时代作了个参与者，不论是多么微末的一个。在你们说来，许久之后，我会成为第三世纪里一个不重要的教宗，又重逢了一些我的旧识——而且——如果你容我幽默一下——再次地熟悉铃声(译注：天主教仪式中常用到)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth first referred to his incarnation as a minor Pope in Jane’s ESP class session for May 15, 1971. Some eighteen people were present. The session was recorded, so the quotes that follow are verbatim. Seth was in a high, if somewhat ribald, mood:</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯首次在1971年5月15日珍的ESP班上，谈到他作为一个次等教宗的那次转生。那节约有十八个人在场，并录下了音，因此以下是逐字引用的。赛斯是在一种亢奋的、却有些不敬的情绪里：</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“… for I was a pope in A.D. 300. I was not a very good pope.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“………因为我在公元3世纪时是个教宗。我并不是个很好的教宗。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I had two illegitimate children [class laughter], a mistress that sneaked into my private study, a magician that I kept in case I did not do too well on my own, a housekeeper who was pregnant every year that I had her, and three daughters who joined a nunnery because I would not have them ---- and I am referred to in barely three paltry lines, for my reign did not last very long.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我有两名私生子〔同学们哄笑〕；一个潜入我私人书房的情妇；我养着一个魔术师，以备万一我靠自己弄得不太好的时候；一个管家，在我“雇用”她的时候年年怀孕：还有三个女儿，在我不肯要她们时入了修女院——而只有三行微不足道的文字谈到我，因为我的统治没有维持多久。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Now: I had a large family ---- that is, I came from a large family, and I was ambitious, as all intelligent young men of that time were. I did not go for the military, so there was nothing to do but go to the church.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(““我有一个大家庭——我是说，我来自一个大家庭，而我雄心勃勃，如那时所有聪明的年轻人一样。我没去从军，因此没别的可干，只能参加教会。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“For a while I was not in Rome but held my religious call elsewhere. I wrote two Church laws. It should all go to show you that some good ends up from everything. I died of trouble with my stomach because I was such a glutton. My name was not Clement [in answer to a question from a class member] although Clement is a lovely name.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“有一阵子我不在罗马而在别处从事宗教工作。我写了两条教会法。这些都显示给你们看，每件事都会有一些好结果。因为我是个如此好吃的人，终致死于胃疾。我的名字不是克里门〔回答班上一个人的问题〕。虽然克里门是个可爱的名字。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I was originally called Protonius. Now give me a moment. The last name is not nearly so clear, and this is not my papal name, but my ---- if you will forgive the term ---- common name: Meglemanius, the third. From a small village.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我本来是叫作普罗东尼斯(Protonius)。现在等我一下。姓不怎么清楚，而这不是我的教宗用名，而是我的——若你肯原谅这用语——贱名：Meglemanius三世，来自一个小乡村。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Unless I summon the self that I was at that time, the memories for details are not that clear. But as I now recall them, without directly checking on our friend the Pope, who has, you must understand, gone his own way, I am coming as close as I can. We did not have as many guards at that time, but we had many stolen paintings and jewels of great merit. Now some of these jewels, as well as the money, went for expeditions that you do not realize were adopted at the time, having to do with commerce and ships sent to Africa; and this interest had to do with my later life when I was involved with the oregano [as a spice merchant in Denmark, in the 1600’s]. My sniffing goes back for centuries.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(除非我召来我在那时的自己，否则我对细节的记忆不是那么清楚。但就我现在回想起来，在没与我们的教宗朋友核对之下——你必须了解他已走了他的阳关道——我已经尽可能地接近事实了。我们在那时没有这么多卫士，但我们有许多价值连城的偷来的画和珠宝。这些珠宝和钱有一些用在你们所不知的远征上，那是与派到非洲的船和贸易有关的；而我这生的兴趣与我后来涉及一种薄荷科香料Oregano的一生〔在1600年代作为丹麦的一名香料商〕有关。我喜欢嗅东西的习惯可回溯好几个世纪。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“There were two brothers strongly united in control of Italy at the time. Perhaps I should say two males, one in the higher capacity and the other his chancellor, with whom I was involved as Pope; and I sent armies to the north also.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“在那时有两兄弟强固地联合起来以控制意大利。也许我该说是两个男人，一个身份较高而另一个是他的大臣，我以教皇身份与他们论交；我也曾派军队到北方作战。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“We had not yet begun the strong insistence upon indulgences, so I did not have that extra cash that indulgences would bring in. I believed and did not believe, as you [to a class member] earlier believed and did not believe, and I did a good job of hiding from myself what I believed and what I did not believe. And the higher one gets in power, the harder it is to hide such things from one’s self.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我们还没开始对‘赎罪券’大力坚持，因此我没有‘赎罪券’带来的外快。我既相信又不相信，就如你〔对班上的一人〕先前既相信而又不相信一样，而我很擅于瞒过自己我信什么和不信什么。一个人的权位越高，越不容易在这种事上自欺。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I was very fond of my first mistress, whose name was Maria. And there were no such sane rules as those in which you now sit, and there were no governments as secure in which you could reside as those you now enjoy.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我很喜欢我的第一个情妇，她叫玛丽亚。当时没有如你们现在所用的这种健全法规，也享受不到如你们现在所属的如此安全可靠的政府。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I did believe implicitly in the God in which I was brought up, and in that belief . It was only later that I wondered how such a god would choose me for such a position ---- and then I began to wonder. I had four lives following that of the most adverse circumstances, to make sure that I understood the difference between luxury and poverty, pride and compassion. And there were days in other centuries that I walked the same streets that I had walked as Pope. I touched these streets lightly as Pope; but as a peasant I walked with a heavy foot and great weight, until I learned the lessons that I had to learn, as all of you will also learn your own lessons.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“暗地里，对我从小就被灌输的宗教信仰及‘上帝’，我的确是相信的。一直要到后来我才疑惑，这么一位‘上帝’怎会选我担任这样一个位子——就在那时我才开始起了疑惑。在那一生之后，我有四生处境非常恶劣，为的是使我了解奢侈与贫穷、骄傲与同情之间的不同。在其他世纪里，我也有过机会走过做教宗时所走过的同样街道。做教宗的我轻快地触及这些街道；但身为农夫时，我背负重物踏着沉重的步子，直到学到了我必须学到的教训，就如你们每个人也都要学你们自己的教训一样。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(At this writing we do not know which pope Seth referred to. When I came to type up this session I wondered if Seth-Jane’s mention of the third century might be an error. [If so, I hadn’t been quick enough to catch it; I could have asked about it at once.] Since Seth gave A.D. 300 in the class session for last May, I personally think it more likely that his papal incarnation followed this date, taking place in the fourth century. The fourth century encompasses the years A.D. 301 to 400, since our modern computation of time is based upon the assumed date of the birth of Christ. The Encyclopaedia Britannica lists eleven popes and two antipopes between A.D. 296 and 401. Some of the reigns were very brief, some of the dates of tenure uncertain or estimated.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在写这些时，我们不知赛斯讲的是哪个教宗。当我在打这节的字时，我猜想不知赛斯——珍说到第三世纪是否是个错误。〔如果是如此，我那时反应不够快，没抓到错误；我本可立即问他的。〕既然在去年5月的课中，赛斯说到公元300年，我个人认为更可能他当教宗的转世是在这日期之后，在第四世纪时发生。既然我们现代对时间的计算是建立于假设的基督诞辰日上，第四世纪包括了公元301年到400年。《大英百科全书》在公元296到401年间列出十一位教宗与两位僭称的教宗。有些统治期很短，有些任期的日期不太确定或者是估计出来的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Of course we would like to learn more about the incarnation in question. As Seth has already indicated, there is a wealth of information here waiting to be acquired. This brings up a dilemma Jane has confronted often: what to investigate out of the many possibilities available at any given time; then, the choice made, how to find the time to carry out the study.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(自然我们对讨论中的这次转世想知道得更多些。如赛斯已经指明的，此地有丰富的资讯等着被发掘。这引起了一个珍常常面对的两难之局。在任一个时候，在可得的这么多可能性中，到底该调查什么；然后，作了选择之后又如何找时间来做这研究。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It is not my purpose to go into my past existences in any great detail, but to use them to make certain points. First of all, I have been many times both man and woman, and I have immersed myself in various occupations, but always with the idea of learning so that I could teach. I had a firm background in physical existence, therefore, as a prerequisite for my present “work.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我的目的并不是要很详细地讨论我的往世，而是用它们来强调某些要点。首先，我曾经多次生作男人和女人，我也曾把自己浸淫在各种各类的职业里，但总是抱着学习的念头以便我能教别人。因此，我在人世生活里有一个坚实的背景，以作为我目前“工作”的先修科目。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I did not play the part of any towering personality of historical note, but became experienced in the homey and intimate details of daily life, the normal struggle for achievement, the need for love. I learned the unutterable yearning of father for son, son for father, husband for wife, wife for husband, and fell headlong into the intimate webs of human relationships. Before your idea of history, I was a Lumanian, and was later born in Atlantis.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我并没扮演任何崇高的历史性人物，却对日常生活家常的、亲密的细节——正常的为成功而奋斗、对爱的需要——变得很有经验。我知道父亲对儿子、儿子对父亲、丈夫对妻子、妻子对丈夫的无法言宣的渴望，而一头栽入亲密的人际关系网中。在你们有所谓的历史之前，我是个鲁曼尼亚人，而后来生在亚特兰蒂斯。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Using your historical reference, I returned at the time of the cavemen, operating as a Speaker. Now I have always been a Speaker, regardless of my physical occupation. I have been a spice merchant in Denmark, where I knew Ruburt and Joseph. In several lives I was black ---- once in what is now called Ethiopia, and once in Turkey.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>参照你们的历史而言。我在穴居时代回来，做一个“说法者”。其实我一直都是个“说法者”，不管我实际上的职业为何。我曾在丹麦作香料商，在那儿我认识了鲁柏与约瑟。我有几世是黑人——一次在现在叫作衣索匹亚的地方，一次在土耳其。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>My lives as monks followed my experience as a pope, and in one of these, I was a victim of the Spanish Inquisition. My experience in female lives varied from that of a plain Dutch spinster to a courtesan at the time of the biblical David, to several existences as a humble mother with children.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我做僧侣的几世是在我做教宗的经验之后，其中一次，我曾是“西班牙宗教裁判”的一名受害者。我做女人的经验变化多端：由一个平凡的荷兰老小姐到圣经里大卫时代的一名高级妓女，还有几回是有着一堆孩子的卑微母亲。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now when I began contacting Ruburt and Joseph, I hid from them the fact of my numerous lives. (Smile): Ruburt, in particular, did not accept reincarnation, and the idea of such multiple life experiences would have been highly scandalous to him.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>且说当我开始与鲁柏和约瑟接触时，我对他们隐瞒了我多次转世的事实。(微笑：)鲁柏尤其不接受转世的事，而这种多重人生的经验会令他极为反感。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The times and names and dates are not nearly as important as the experiences, and they are too numerous to list here. However, I will see to it at some time that these are made fully available. Some have been given in Ruburt’s class sessions, and some, though few, have appeared in The Seth Material itself.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>时代、名字和日期远不及那些经验本身重要，而我的经验是多到无法全列在此的。不过，我会留意，有一天把这些全都给你们。有些我在鲁柏的班上给过，有些，虽然不多——曾出现在《灵界的讯息》那本书里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In a book on reincarnation, I hope to have each of my previous personalities speak for themselves, for they should tell their own story. You should understand, therefore, that those personalities still exist and are independent. While what I am once seemed to be contained within those personalities, I was but the seed for them. In your terms, I can remember who I was; in greater terms, however, those personalities should speak for themselves.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在一本专论转世的书里，我希望让我每一个先前的人格现身说法，因为他们自己的故事该由他们自己来讲。因此，你该明白，那些人格仍旧存在并且是独立的。虽然“我现在是什么”一度好像包含在那些人格内，我却只是他们的种子。用你们的话来说，我能记得我曾是谁；可是广义来说，那些人格应该替他们自己说话。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Perhaps you will see an analogy here when you compare the situation with age regression under hypnosis. Those personalities are not locked up inside of what I am, however. They have progressed according to their own fashion. They are not negated. In my terms, they coexist with me, but at another layer of reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>也许这里你会看出一个相似之处，当你将这情形与在催眠下的“年龄回溯”(age regression)相比。不过，那些人格并没有被“我现在是什么”锁住。他们照他们自己的方式向前进。他们并没被否定。在我来说，他们与我同在，但却是在实相的另一层面上。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:56. Jane said she’d really been out. As sometimes happens, memory and images connected with the material began to come back to her as we talked. She experienced a sense of expansion, an impression of great crowds. Then she remembered a stinking stall with dirty straw, and “three men wearing dirty brown robes, of pretty rough cloth.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:56。珍说她真的出去了。如有时会发生的，在我们闲谈时，与资料相连的记忆与意象开始回到她心中。她体验到一种扩张感，和一大群人的印象。然后她记起了一个有脏干草的臭厩房，以及““个人穿着很粗的布料做的肮脏棕色袍子”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane sat half in trance, “seeing more stuff now than in the session itself.” It was as though a light within her focused upon one small area. She saw grease or wax from a candle, falling upon one of the robes and staining it. In the stall there were long oval bundles of straw, stacked one upon another “to keep it dry, pretty high up to the roof. Each bundle is tied but not covered.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍在半出神状态里坐着，她“现在比在课间看到更多的东西”。就好像她的内在有一点光集中于一个小地区。她看到油脂或一点蜡掉在其中的一件袍子上而弄脏了它。在厩舍里有长长的椭园形干草束，一捆堆在一捆上面“以保持其干燥，一直堆到了屋顶。每一捆都是绑起来的却没盖着”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Now she smelled something very rancid. “Seth has some kind of soap with his wares ---- some awful mixture with lye and rosewater,” she said, unbelieving, her nose wrinkling. “This was in some kind of woven sack; a double one like you’d throw over a horse…. I can almost see it in front of me. I could draw the shape of it, though it’s not any big deal.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(现在她闻到很腐臭的东西，她不相信地说：“赛斯的货物里有某种肥皂——某种可怕的硷水与玫瑰香水混合，”她的鼻子皱起来，“这是在某种编织好的袋子里；两个相连的就如你丢在马背上的那种………我几乎可以看见它在我眼前。我可以画出它的形状，虽然没什么大不了。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“That’s it ---- all that opened up after you started talking about it,” she said finally. “I didn’t have any bigger vision, and I didn’t know how far to go along with it. When I saw the double sack, that’s all I saw….”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(她终于说：“好了——在你开始谈起它后，所有那些都现出来了。我没有任何大些的幻相，我不知道应顺着它走多远。当我看到那个‘双袋’，那是所有我看到的……”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane was obviously much more relaxed now than when she’d started this chapter. She was yawning deeply, again and again, her eyes watering. I suggested an end to the session, but she wanted to continue. Resume at 11:19.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(现在珍显然比开始此章时轻松多了。她在深深地打呵欠，一次又一次，眼泪也流出来了。我建议结束此节，但她要继续。在11:19重新开始。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In several lives I was consciously aware of my “past existences.” Once as a monk I found myself copying a manuscript that I myself had written in another life.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有好几世我都有意识地觉知我的“前世”。有一次在做僧侣的时候，我发现自己在抄写我自己在另一世所写的一篇稿子。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Often I was given to the love of weight, and possessed it. Twice I died of starvation. I always found my deaths highly educational ---- in your terms, afterwards. It was always a lesson between lives to trace the thoughts and events that “led to a given demise.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我常常耽溺于对重量的喜爱，并且真的很胖。有两次我死于饥饿。我总是发现我的死亡具教育意义——以你们的话来说，是在事后。在两世之间追踪那“导致某次死亡”的想法与事件永远是一个教训。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>None of my deaths surprised me. I felt during the process the inevitability, the recognition, even a sense of familiarity: “Of course, this particular dying is mine and no other.” And I accepted even the most bizarre circumstances then, feeling almost a sense of perfection. The life could not be finished properly without the death.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我的死都没令我惊奇过。在过程中间我感到那不可避免性，那认知，甚至一种熟悉感：“当然，这种特定的死法是我的，别的都不成。”于是，即使是最古怪的情形我也接受，几乎感受到一种完美感。没有此死，此生不能适当地结束。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There is a great sense of humility, and yet a great sense of exaltation as the inner self senses its freedom when death occurs. All my deaths were the complement of my lives, in that it seemed to me that it could not be otherwise.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当死亡发生时，“内我”感受到它的自由而有一种极大的谦卑感，却又有一种极大的狂喜。我所有死亡补足了我的人生，因为对我而言似乎别无他途。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause at 11:29.) If I choose, in your terms I can relive any portion of those existences, but those personalities go their own way. Do you understand me?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在11:29长久的停顿。)如果我要的话，以你们的话来说，我可以重过那些人生的任何部分，但那些人格走了他们自己的阳关道。你了解我说什么吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“是的。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>On a subjective level I acted as a teacher and a Speaker in each of my lives. In a few highly intuitive existences I was aware of this fact. You do not understand as yet the high importance of the underside of consciousness. Beside your objective role in each life, your reincarnational challenges also involve your dream states, rhythms of creativity that flow and ebb beneath the daily world you know. So I became highly proficient in this way as a Speaker and a teacher in several lives that were externally uninteresting by contrast.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在一个主观层面上，在我每一生中我都充当教师与“说法者”。在几个直觉性很强的人生里，我是觉察这个事实的。你还不了解意识的背面有多重要。除了你在每生中的客观角色外，你的转世挑战也涉及到你的梦境，那些在你所知的日常世界之下起落的创造性节奏。因此我在几世中透过这种方式变成极熟练的“说法者”与教师，对比之下，这几世的表面生活则很无趣。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>My influence, work, and concern in such cases was far more vast than my quiet objective pursuits. I give you this information hoping to help you understand the true nature of your own reality. My reincarnational existences do not define what I am, however, nor do yours define you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这种情形，我的影响、工作与关心的事比我平静的客观追求要广博得多。我给你这资讯是希望帮你了解你自己实相的真实本质。可是，我的转世人生并没界定“我是什么”，而你的也没界定你。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, you may take a break or end the session as you prefer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在，你可以休息或结束此节，随你的便。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“We’ll take the break.” 11:35. When I feel that Jane might choose to continue a session, I ask for a break instead of ending the session. It had been a slow delivery, and Jane knew she hadn’t been out long.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我们休息一下。”11:35。当我感觉珍也许想选择继续下去，就要求休息一下而非结束那节。这段说得很慢，珍知道她没有出去很久。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I don’t know what to do now, about continuing,” she said after we’d talked briefly. “I know what Seth’s got planned, but I don’t know how he’s going to go about it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在我们短短地谈了一下之后她说：“我不知现在怎么继续，我知道赛斯计划了什么，但我不知道他打算怎么去着手。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“What’s up? I don’t understand ?”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“怎么了？我不懂——”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“He’s going to let Seth Two come through.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“他将要让‘赛斯二’〔Seth Two〕透过来。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth Two is dealt with at length in Chapter Seventeen of Jane’s book The Seth Material. This personality speaks occasionally in ESP class, but relatively seldom in our private sessions. In the outline Seth gave for this book before dictation began, we were told that Seth Two would be explained. Some of our questions for Chapter Twenty had concerned Seth Two also. I’d forgotten both points for the moment ---- hence my surprise.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在珍的书《灵界的讯息》的第十七章里，对“赛斯二”讲得很详细。这人物偶尔会在ESP班上说话，但相当少在我们的私人课里说话。在本书的口述开始前赛斯给的大纲里，他告诉了我们将会解释“赛斯二”。我们为第二十章所列的问题也有些是与“赛斯二”有关的。我一时忘了这两点，才会感到惊讶。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(But now, at 11:40, Jane didn’t know whether to end the session, as I’d suggested earlier, or continue. She finally decided to “just sit quietly for a minute.” Then: “I don’t know whether to shut it down or not ---- it could go on for another hour….” I told her I was game if she was. Seth resumed at 11:45.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(但现在，在11:40，珍不知是否要如我先前建议的结束此节，或是继续。她终于决定“这样安静地坐一分钟”，然后：“我不知要不要把它关闭——可能会再继续一个小时——”我告诉她我有兴致如果她也有的话。赛斯在11:45继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: The soul knows itself, and is not confused by terms or definitions. Through showing you the nature of my own reality, I hope to teach you the nature of your own.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>灵魂认识它自己，并不会为术语或定义所搅乱。我希望能借由给你们看我自己的实相，而教你们你们自己实相的本质。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You are not bound to any category or corner of existence. Your reality cannot be measured any more than mine. I hope to illustrate the function of consciousness and personality through writing this book and enlarging your concepts.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你们并没被限制在存在的任一类别或角落。你们的实相与我的实相同样无边无际，无法量度。我希望借着此书说明意识与人格的功能，而放大你们的观念。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now I began by telling you that I was dictating this material through the auspices of a woman of whom I was quite fond. Let me now tell you that there are other realities involved. The following paragraphs will be written by another personality, who stands relatively in the same position to me as I stand to the woman through whom I am now speaking.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我一开始就说过，我由一个我相当喜欢的女士之口传授这资料。现在且让我告诉你们，还有别的实相也牵涉在内。下面几段将由另一个人物来写，他之于我差不多就像我之于我透过她说话的这女士一样。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 11:51. I now watched a transformation begin to take place in Jane, as our familiar Seth retreated and Seth Two began to come to the fore. At the same time I knew that subjectively Jane was experiencing the feeling of a “cone” or “pyramid” coming down over the top of her head. Jane has often told me that whereas she feels Seth come to her in a very warm and alive and friendly manner, she feels her consciousness going out of herself to meet Seth Two ---- “up the invisible pyramid like a draft up a flue.” She doesn’t know where she goes or how she gets back. Her body seems to be left behind.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在11:51停顿。我现在眼见在珍身上开始了一种变化，当我们熟悉的赛斯撤退而“赛斯二”开始变成中心人物。同时我知道珍正自经历到一个“圆锥”或“金字塔”降到她头顶上的感觉。珍过去常告诉我，虽然她感觉赛斯以一种非常温暖有活力且友善的方法到来，她却感到她的意识走出了她自己去与“赛斯二”会面——像一阵风升上烟囱似地升到隐形的金字塔去。她并不知道她到哪里去了，也不知道怎么回来的。她的身体似乎被留下，没被带走。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane sat very formally in her Kennedy rocker, her forearms upon the arms of the chair, her feet flat upon the rug. lt was a muggy night; our living room windows were open, and now I became conscious of traffic noise. I heard someone moving about in the apartment upstairs.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍端坐在她的甘乃迪摇椅里，她的前臂放在椅子扶手上，她的脚平放在地毯上。这是个闷热的晚上；我们客厅的窗子开着，现在我开始意识到交通的噪音，我听见楼上公寓有人在走动。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane’s eyes were closed, but occasionally they opened slightly. She smiled faintly as she spoke for Seth Two. The voice that began to issue from her was very high, very distant and formal, with little volume or emphasis. Each word was carefully and deliberately, almost delicately, spoken. It was as though Seth Two wasn’t familiar with vocal chords or words, and so took pains to use those mechanisms in just the right way. The contrast between the two Seths couldn’t have been more complete.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍的眼睛是闭着的，但偶尔微睁。当她为“赛斯二”说话时脸上有淡淡的笑容。开始她发出非常高的声音，非常遥远而正式，音量不大也没有什么抑扬顿挫。每个字都是小心而慎重的，几乎是文雅地说出。就好像是“赛斯二”对声带或语句不熟悉，因而非常小心地以正确的方式用这些机制。两位赛斯之间的对比是不能再彻底的了。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We are the voices who speak without tongues of our own. We are sources of that energy from which you come. We are creators, yet we have also been created. We seeded your universe as you seed other realities.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们就是没有自己的舌头而说话的声音。我们就是你们所来自的那能量之源。我们是创造者，我们却也曾被创造。我们播种了你们的宇宙，如同你们播种了其他的实相。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We do not exist in your historical terms, nor have we known physical existence. Our joy created the exaltation from which your world comes. Our existence is such that communication must be made by others to you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们并不存在于你们的历史里，我们也从不知人间的生活。我们的快乐创造了你们世界所来自的狂喜。我们的存在状况使得我们之间的沟通必须假手他人。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Verbal symbols have no meaning for us. Our experience is not translatable. We hope our intent is. In the vast infinite scope of consciousness, all is possible. There is meaning in each thought. We perceive your thoughts as lights. They form patterns. (Each syllable was so carefully and separately pronounced.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>语言的符号对我们没意义。我们的经验是无法转译的，我希望我们的意图可以。在意识广大无垠的范围里，所有的事全是可能的。每个思想都有意义，你们的思想在我们看来就像“光”一样。它们形成模式。(每个音节都是这么小心地、分开地说出来。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Because of the difficulties of communication, it is nearly impossible for us to explain our reality. Know only that we exist. We send immeasurable vitality to you, and support all of those structures of consciousness with which you are familiar. You are never alone. (Pause.) We have always sent emissaries to you who understand your needs. Though you do not know us, we cherish you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因为沟通上的困难，我们几乎不可能向你们解释我们的实相。你们只要知道我们存在就好。我们送出无量的活力给你们，并且支撑着所有那些你们熟知的意识结构。你们永不孤单。(停顿。)我们一直在派遣了解你们需要的密使给你们。虽然你们不认识我们，我们却珍爱你们。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Seth is a point in my reference, in our reference. He is an ancient portion of us. (Pause.) We are separate but united. (Long pause.) Always the spirit forms the flesh.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>赛斯是我的参考架构、我们的参考架构里的一个点。他是我们的一个古老的部分。(停顿。)我们是分开却又联合为一体的。(停顿良久。)永远是精神形成肉体。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(12:06 A.M. This was the end of the session. As usual when Seth Two speaks, the end was unannounced, and came without any of the warmth and emotional exchange that often involves Seth, Jane, and me.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(凌晨12:06。此节到此结束。就如通常“赛斯二”说话时的情形，并不宣告结束，也没有任何常涉及赛斯、珍和我的温暖以及情感上的交流。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane’s eyes were heavy. For some few minutes she had trouble keeping them open. She hadn’t changed her position in her rocker for the duration of the delivery, and she’d experienced the usual cone effect. I’d had to ask for a word or two to be repeated when it had been obliterated by a burst of traffic noise.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍眼皮沉重。有好几分钟她很难让它们不闭上。在传述期间她在摇椅中没有改变位置，而她经历到了通常的圆锥效应。当一股嘈杂车声淹没了一两个字时，我必须请她重复一下。)</a>
