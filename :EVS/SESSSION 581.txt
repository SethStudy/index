<a id=1 href=1>第580节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>APRIL 12, 1971, 9:13 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年4月12日 星期一 晚上9：30</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Wednesday’s session, the 579th, was held for a husband and wife who have an acute problem involving one of their children. The family lives in another state and we have never met. We learned later that Seth’s material was very helpful.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(星期三的第579节是为一对夫妇，他们有个孩子有严重的问题。这个家庭住在另一州，我们从未见过面。后来我们得知赛斯的资料对他们很有帮助。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Before the session tonight I discussed two questions with Jane that I hoped Seth would consider. We also wanted some personal material. The session was held in my studio once again.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(今晚的课开始前，我跟珍讨论了两个我希望赛斯会予以考虑的问题。我们同时也想要一些个人的资料。这课还是在我的画室举行。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Do you want to begin with questions or with personal material?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：你要开始问问题呢？或是要个人的资料？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“How about a question first?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“先来个问题好吗？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You give it to me then.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那就问吧。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Number twenty: If everything exists now, or at once, how can it be added to through constant creation and expansion? Or to put it another way: If we are constantly creating, how can All That Is exist as complete now?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“第二十：如果每件事都存在于现在，怎能经由不断的创造与扩展而予以增加？或换个方式说：如果我们是不断地在创造，‘一切万有’现在怎能以完整的样子存在？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>All That Is is not done and finished.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“一切万有”并没完成与结束。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause. Jane’s pace was alternately fast and slow.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(停顿很久。珍的步调时快时慢。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Everything within your three-dimensional system occurs simultaneously. Each action creates other possibilities of itself, or other actions from the infinite energy of the universe, which itself is never still. The answer is that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在你们三次元系统的一切都是同时地发生。每件行动创造了它自己的其他可能性，或其他的行动，由永不静止的宇宙的无穷能量而来。答案是“全部”比其部分之总和为多(停顿)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>All That Is simultaneously and unendingly creates itself. Only within your particular frame of reference does there seem to be a contradiction between action that is simultaneous and yet unending. This has to do mainly with the necessary distortions arising from your time concept and the idea of duration; for duration to you presupposes existence continued within a time framework ---- predisposing to beginnings and endings.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“一切万有”同时地、无止境地创造祂自己。只有在你们特殊的参考架构之内，在“同时”而却“无穷尽的”行动之间似乎有一个矛盾。这主要是与你们的时间观念，以及“延续”的概念所造成的扭曲有关，因为“延续”(duration)对你们而言，是以在一个时间架构内继续存在为先决条件——预设了有“开始”与“结束”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Experience existing outside of that reference is not dependent upon duration in your terms. There is no “perfect ending,” no completed perfection beyond which further experience is impossible or meaningless. (Long pause.) All That Is is a source of infinite and unending simultaneous action. Everything happens at once, and yet there is no beginning and end to it in your terms, so it is not completed in your terms at any given point.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>存在于那参考架构之外的经验，并不靠你们所说的“延续”才能存在。并没有“完美的结局”，并没有已完成的完美，凡超过了它的更进一步经验就为不可能或是无意义的。(停顿很久。)“一切万有”是无限与无穷尽的同时行动的源头。每件事都是同时发生的，却没有你们所谓的“开始”也没有“结尾”，因此，在任一既定点也没有你们所谓“已完成”的东西。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:25.) Your idea of development and growth, again, implies a one-line march toward perfection, so it would be difficult for you to imagine the kind of order that pervades. Ultimately a completed or finished God, or All That Is, would end up smothering His creation. For perfection presupposes that point beyond which development is impossible, and creativity at an end.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:25)你们对发展与成长的概念，还是在暗示一个朝向完美的单线行进，因此对你们而言，你们会很难想象无所不在的这种秩序。一个完成了或结束了的“神”或“一切万有”终究会闷死了祂的创造物。因为完美预设了一个点，超过了那点，发展是不可能的，而创造力也到了尾声。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There would be an order in which only predestination could rule, each part fitting in with a particular order without freedom to change the pattern given it. There is order, but within this order there is freedom ---- the freedom of creativity, that characteristic of All That Is, that guarantees its infinite becoming.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果那样就会有一种秩序，在其中只有命定论可以作主，每一个部分都照一个特殊的秩序配合起来，没有自由去改变给它的模式。其实，秩序的确是有的，但在这种秩序内是有自由的——创造的自由，那即“一切万有”的特性，保证祂无止境的变为。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now in that infinite becoming, there are states that you would call perfected, but had creativity rested within them, all of experience would be destined to grind to a halt. Yet this great complexity is not unwieldy; it is as simple, in fact, as a seed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在那无止境的变为里，有些你会称之为“已达完美”的情境，若非在其中潜伏创造性，则所有的经验都会命定的嘎然而止。但这伟大的复杂性并不是很难处理的；事实上，它是与一粒种子一样的简单。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:32.) All That Is is inexhaustible. Infinity rests within simultaneous action, in a way that you cannot presently understand.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30)“一切万有”是无穷尽的。以一种你现在还不能了解的方式，无限性就藏在“同时的行动”之内。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Give us a moment. (Long pause.) All That Is is alive within the least of itself, aware within for example the molecule. It endows all of its parts ---- or its creations ---- with its own abilities that then act as inspiration, impetus, guiding lines and principles, by which these parts then seek to further create themselves, their own worlds and systems. This is freely given.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>请等我们一会儿。(停顿良久。)“一切万有”在祂自己最卑微的部分之内也是“活的”，例如祂甚至在一个“分子”里也有觉察。祂赐与祂所有的部分——或祂的“创造物”——祂自己的能力，于是那些能力又转而变为灵感、推动力、指南与原则，然后这些部分再用它寻求更进一步地创造他们自己、他们自己的世界与系统。这是豪爽而慷慨地赠与的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause at 9:37.) These powers and abilities will be used by these creations in various ways. In your own case mankind is forming his reality through the use of these gifts. He is learning to use them efficiently and well. He uses them to exist. They form the basis of his reality. Within that framework, individually and as a whole, mankind may seem to make errors, to bring ill health, death or desolation upon himself, but he is still using those abilities to create a world.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:37停顿很久。)这些“创造物”以种种不同的方式利用这些力量与能力。在你们自己的例子里，人类是经由利用这些礼物而形成他的实相的。他在学着有效地、妥善地利用它们。他利用它们以存在，它们形成他的实相的基础。在那架构内，人类个人以致全体也许看起来好像在犯错，在给他自己带来不健康、死亡或孤绝，但他仍在用那些能力来创造一个世界。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Through observing his creations he learns how to use these abilities better. He checks on his inner progress by seeing the physical materiaization of his work. The work, the reality, is still a creative achievement, although it may portray a tragedy or unspeakable terror in your terms at any given time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>人类借由观察他的创造物而学到如何更善用这些能力。他借由看见他工作的物质具体化来检查他内在的进步。这工作、这实相仍是一项创造性的成就，虽则在任一既定时间，以你的话来说，它可能绘出一个悲剧或不可言说的恐怖。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Well, you’re leading into the next question then. Number twenty-one: How do you account for the pain and suffering in the world?” Many people have asked us this question.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“嗯，那么你正导入了下一个问题。第二十一：你对世上的痛苦与受苦怎么解释呢？”许多人问过我们这个问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:43.) I am indeed. A great painting of a battle scene, for example, may show the ability of the artist as he projects in all its appalling drama the inhuman and yet all-too-human conditions of war. The artist is using his abilities. In the same way, man is using his abilities, and they are apparent when he creates a real war.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:43)我的确正要解释这一点。举例来说，一幅关于一次战役现场的伟大画作会显出画家的能力，当他在它所有的可怖戏剧里，把那不人道却又太人性的战争情状全都投射进去的时候，画家是在用他的能力。同样的，当人创造了一次真的战争时，他是在用他的能力，而它们是很明显的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The artist who paints such a scene may do so for several reasons: because he hopes through portraying such inhumanity to awaken people to its consequences, to make them quail and change their ways; because he is himself in such a state of disease and turmoil that he directs his abilities in that particular manner; or because he is fascinated with the problem of destruction and creativity, and of using creativity to portray destruction.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>画这样一幅景象的画家，可能为了几个理由而这样做：因为他希望透过描写这种“惨无人道”来唤醒人们看到其结果，使他们畏缩而改变他们的方式；因为他自己是在一种如此病态与混乱的状态，以致他以那种特别方式运用他的能力；或是因他着迷于“毁灭”与“创造”的问题，以及用创造力去描绘毁灭的问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In your wars you are using creativity to create destruction, but you cannot help being creative.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在你们的战争里，你们是用创造力来创造毁灭，但你们却无法不具创造性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:48.) Illness and suffering are not thrust upon you by God, or by All That Is, or by an outside agency. They are by-products of the learning process, created by you, in themselves quite neutral. On the other hand, your existence itself, the reality and nature of your planet, the whole existence in which you have these experiences, are also created by you, using the abilities of which I have spoken.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:48)疾病与痛苦并非由“神”或“一切万有”或一个外在因素硬推到你身上的。它们是学习过程的一种副产品，由你所创造，它们本身是相当中立的。在另一方面来说，你自己存在的本身，你们地球的实相与本质，你在其中有这些经验的整个存在，也都是你们所创造的，应用我刚说过的能力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Illness and suffering are the results of the misdirection of creative energy. They are a part of the creative force, however. They do not come from a different source than, say, health and vitality. suffering is not good for the soul, unless it teaches you how to stop suffering. That is its purpose.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>疾病与痛苦是创造性能量误入歧途的结果。可是，它们是创造力的一部分，好比说，它们并非与健康和活力来自不同的来源。受苦对灵魂没有好处，除非它教给你如何停止受苦。那才是它的目的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Within your particular plane of activity, and speaking practically, no one fully or completely can use all the energy available to them, or completely materialize the inner sensed identity that is multidimensional. This inner identity is the blueprint however against which you judge, ultimately, your physical actions. You strive to express as best you can the entire potential that is within you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在你们特定的活动层面里，老实说，没有一个人能充分或彻底地用他们可利用的全部能量，或完全具体化你内在感觉到的本体，那是多次元的。这内在本体正就是那蓝图，你终究会比照着它来判断你的实际行动。你努力去尽可能地表现你内在的全部潜能。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:58.) Within that framework, it is possible to have sane and healthy minds within healthy bodies, to have a sane planet. The release and use of creative energy expended simply to maintain your planet and your existence, is impossible to conceive of. The great amount of energy available to you gives you great leeway in its use.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:58。)在那架构之内，是可能在健康的身体内有健全与健康的心智，有一个健全的星球。仅只为维持你们的星球与你们的存在，所释出与用到的创造性能量是不可想象的。你们可用的能量其量之大，足以给你们在其利用上有极大的活动余地。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I have mentioned before that everyone within your system is learning to handle this creative energy; and since you are still in the process of doing so, you will often misdirect it. The resulting snarl in activities automatically brings you back to inner questions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我提到过，在你们系统里的每个人，都在学着处理这创造性的能量；既然你们仍在这样做的过程中，你们常会误导它。那些活动所引起的纠结混乱自动把你带回到内在的问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:02. This was the end of the material on Seth’s book. The balance of the session was taken up with personal material. End at 11:06 P.M.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:02。这结束了赛斯书的资料。个人的资料用掉了余下的时间。在11:06结束。)</a>
