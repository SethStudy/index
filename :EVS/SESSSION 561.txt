<a id=1 href=1>(Jane has been resting from sessions lately, except for a couple given for her ESP class.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(近来珍除了为她的ESP班上了两次赛斯课外，都没上过课。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在，晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will resume dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们再继续口述。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are many probable systems of reality, therefore, in which physical data predominates, but such physical Probabilities represent but one small portion. Each of you also exist in nonphysical systems, and I have explained earlier that your slightest thought or emotion is manifested in many other ways than in your own field of existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，有许多可能的实相系统，是以物质的资料为主的。但这种物质的可能性系统只代表了一小部分。你们每个人也都存在于非物质的系统(nonphysical systems)里。我先前曾解释过，你最微不足道的思想或情感不只显现在你自己的存在场所里，而且也显现在许多其他方面。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Only a portion of your entire identity is “presently” familiar to you, as you know. Therefore, when you consider the question of a supreme being, you imagine a male personality with those abilities that you yourselves possess, with great emphasis upon qualities you admire. This imagined god has therefore changed throughout your centuries, mirroring man’s shifting ideas of himself.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如你所知，你全部的本体只有一部分“现在”为你所熟悉。因此，当你思考一个至高的存在体(supreme being)这个问题时，你便会想象一个男性人格，具有你自己所有的那些能力，并且特别强调你所推崇的那些特质。这个想象出来的上帝于是随着世代而改变，反映出人对他自己想法的改变。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>God was seen as cruel and powerful when man believed that these were desirable characteristics, needed particularly in his battle for physical survival. He projected these upon his idea of a god because he envied them and feared them. You have cast your idea of god, therefore, in your own image.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>上帝被看成是残酷而有威力的，当人相信这些是他们想要的特性，尤其是在他为生存的奋斗中所必需的。因为他对这些特性又羡又妒，他就把它们投射到他对神的意念上。因此，你按自己的意象铸造了你对神的概念。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In a reality that is inconceivably multidimensional, the old concepts of God are relatively meaningless. Even the term, a supreme being, is in itself distortive, for you naturally project the qualities of human nature upon it. If I told you that God was an idea, you would not understand what I meant, for you do not understand the dimensions in which an idea has its reality, or the energy that it can originate and propel.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在一个不可想象的多次元实相里，对神的古老观念相对的就没有意义了。甚至这个名词——至高的存有——本身就是扭曲的，因为你自然就会把人性的种种品质投射上去。如果我告诉你“神”是个意念，你不会明白我的意思，因为你不了解在其中一个意念具有实相的那些个次元，你也不了解意念能创造与推动的能量。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You do not believe in ideas in the same way that you believe in physical objects , so if I tell you that God is an idea, you will misinterpret this to mean that God is less than real ---- nebulous, without reality, without purpose, and without motive action.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你不相信意念像你相信实物那样，所以如果我告诉你“神”是个意念，你会把它误解成“神”是不太真实的——浑沌、没有实相、没有目的、没有具有动机的行动。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now your own physical image is the materialization of your idea of yourself within the properties of matter. Without the idea of yourself, your physical image would not be; yet often it is all you are aware of. The initial power and energy of that idea of yourself keeps your image alive. Ideas, then, are far more important than you realize. If you will try to accept the idea that your own existence is multidimensional, that you dwell within the medium of infinite Probabilities, then you may catch a slight glimpse of the reality that is behind the word “god,” and you may understand why it is almost impossible to capture a true understanding of that concept in words.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>其实，你自己的肉体形象，就是你对自己的意念在物质特性之内的具体化。没有你自己的意念，你不会有肉体的形象，但你却常常只知觉到肉体。就是那个“对你自己的意念”的最初力量和能量，才让你这形象继续活下去。那么，意念远比你了解的重要得多。如果你肯试着接受“我自己的存在是多次元的、我居住在无限的可能性里”这个意念，那么你可能对在“神”这个字后面的实相捕捉到些微的一瞥，而也可能了解，为何几乎不可能以言语来捉住对那观念的真正了解。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>God, therefore, is first of all a creator, not of one physical universe but of an infinite variety of probable existences, far more vast than those aspects of the physical universe with which your scientists are familiar. He did not simply then send a son to live and die on one small planet. He is a part of all Probabilities.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，“神”最要紧的是个创造者，并不是创造一个物质宇宙，而是无穷无量种种的可能世界，比你们科学家所熟悉的物质宇宙的那些要辽阔得多了。因而祂不仅只单单派了一个儿子去生活并死亡在一个小行星上。祂是所有可能性的一部分。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There have been parables told, and stories of beginnings. All of these have been attempts to transmit knowledge in as simple terms as possible. Often answers were given to questions that literally have no meaning outside of your own system of reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>人们说过种种寓言，以及创始的故事(stories of beginnings)。所有这些都是以尽可能简单的说法来传递知识的尝试，它们时常对那些除了在你们自己实相系统之外并没有意义的问题给了答案。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>For example: There was no beginning, and there will be no end, yet parables have been given telling you of beginnings and endings simply because with your distorted ideas of time, beginnings and endings seem to be inseparable, valid events. As you learn to turn the focus of your attention away from physical reality and therefore experience some slight evidence of other realities, your consciousness will cling to old ideas that make true explanations impossible for you to understand. Multidimensional awareness is available to you in your dreams, however, in some trance states, and often even beneath ordinary consciousness as you go about your day.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>举例来说：既没有开始，也不会有结束，但却曾有寓言告诉你们关于开始与结束的故事。只因为以你们对时间的曲解，开始与结束看起来似是不可分的、合逻辑的事件。当你学着把你注意力的焦点由物质宇宙转开，因而对其他实相经验到一些微小的证据时，你的意识会紧抓着老概念不放，使你不可能了解真正的解释。不过，在你的梦中，在一些出神状态，以及当你在过日子时，甚至时常在你日常的意识之下，你都可以得到多次元的觉察力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This awareness gives personal experience with the multidimensional richness that exists not apart from but intermingled with, within, through, and all about your physical world of sense. To say that physical life is not real is to deny that reality pervades all appearance, and is a part of all appearance. In the same manner, God does not exist apart from or separate from physical reality, but exists within it and as a part of it, as he exists within and as a part of all other systems of existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这种觉察赋予个人经验多次元的丰富性，这多次元的丰富性并不存在于你肉身的感官世界之外，而是与之混合、存在其中并透过且包围它的。若说肉身生活是不真实的，即是否认实相遍及于所有的表象，而且是所有表象的一部分。那么以同样的方式，“神”并不是存在于物质实相之外，却是存在于其中，为其一部分，就如祂也存在于所有其他存在系统中，并为其一部分。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:46.) Your Christ figure represents, symbolically, your idea of God and his relationships. There were three separate individuals whose history blended, and they became known collectively as Christ ---- hence many discrepancies in your records. These were all males because at that time of your development, you would not have accepted a female counterpart.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:46)你们的基督形象象征性地代表了你们意念中关于“神”以及祂和基督的关系。有三个分开的个人，他们的历史混在一起，而他们被人合在一起认作是基督——因此在你们的记录里有许多矛盾之处。这些人全是男性，因为在你们的那个发展时期，是不会接受一个女性对等者的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>These individuals were a part of one entity. You could not but imagine God as a father. It would never have occurred to you to imagine a god in any other than human terms. Earth components. These three figures worked out a drama, highly symbolic, propelled by concentrated energy of great force.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这三个人同为一个存有的一部分。当时你们只能把“神”想象为一个父亲。你们绝不会想到要用人的想法之外、世俗的关系之外的其他方式去想象一个神。这三个人做出了一出非常象征性的戏，由极有力的浓缩能量所推动。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause at 9:52.) The events as they are recorded, however, did not occur in history. The crucifixion of Christ was a psychic, but not a physical event. ideas of almost unimaginable magnitude were played out.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:52停顿良久。)可是，记录下来的事件并没在历史上发生。基督的被钉十字架是个心灵的而非实质的事件。几乎是不可想象的宏大概念被演了出来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:55.) Judas, for example, was not a man in your terms. He was ---- like all the other disciples ---- a blessed, created “fragment personality,” formed by the Christ personality. He represented the self-betrayer. He dramatized a portion of each individual’s personality that focuses upon physical reality in a grasping manner, and denies the inner self out of greed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:55停顿。)举例来说，犹大在你们的话来说不是一个“人”。他是——就像所有其他的门徒——一个被基督人格所形成的、受祝福的、受造的“片段人格”。他代表自我背叛者。他戏剧化了每个人个性中的那个部分：以贪婪的方式贯注于物质实相，而否认了“内我”的那个部分。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Each of the twelve represented qualities of personality that belong to one individual, and Christ as you know him represented the inner self. The twelve, therefore, plus Christ as you know him (the one figure composed of the three) represented an individual earthly personality ---- the inner self ---- and twelve main characteristics connected with the egotistical self. As Christ was surrounded by the disciples, so the inner self is surrounded by these physically oriented characteristics, each drawn outward toward daily reality on the one hand, and yet orbiting the inner self.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>十二个门徒中的每一个各代表了属于一个人的不同特质，而你们所知的基督代表了“内我”。因此，十二门徒加上你们所知的基督(三位一体的那个)代表了一个俗世人格——内我——以及与人的自我相连的十二个主要特性。就像基督为十二门徒所环绕，内我也是由这些物质取向的特性所环绕，每一属性一方面被吸引向外，倾注于日常的实相，却又环绕着内我而运行。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:03.) The disciples, therefore, were given physical reality by the inner self, as all of your earthly characteristics come out of your inner nature. This was a living parable, made flesh among you ---- a cosmic play worked out for your behalf, couched in terms that you could understand.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:03)因此，“内我”赋予门徒们物质真实性，就像你们全部的人世特性都是由你们的内在本质出来的。这是一个活生生的寓言，被赋予血肉而活在你们中间——为了你们之故而作出的一出宇宙戏剧，以你们所能了解的方法表达出来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The lessons were made plain, as all the ideas behind them were personified. If you will forgive the term, this was like a local morality play, put on in your corner of the universe. This does not mean it was less real than you previously supposed. In fact, the implications of what is said here should clearly hint at the more powerful aspects of godhood.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>教训被明白地表达了，既然所有隐在背后的概念都拟人化了，如果你不怪罪的话，我会说这就像是一出小地方的道德剧，在你们宇宙的一角演出。这并不表示它没有你们先前所假设的那么真实。事实上，此地所说的话应该明白地暗示了“神性”更具威力的那些面。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:07.) When I go slow, you can rest between the lines.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:07)当我讲得慢时，你可以在行间休息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.” Note that Seth hasn’t taken a break yet. Jane’s pace has been very slow at times.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的。”请注意赛斯还没休息过一次，珍的步调有时非常慢。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The three Christ personalities were born upon your planet, and indeed became flesh among you. None of these was crucified. The twelve disciples were materializations from the energies of these three personalities ---- their combined energies. They were then fully endowed with individuality, however, but their main task was to clearly manifest within themselves certain abilities inherent within all men.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>三位基督诞生在你们的行星上，的确是在你们间生成了人。他们都没有被钉死。十二个门徒是由这三个人的能量——他们合起来的能量——而具体化现的。不过，他们接着被完全地赋予了个别性，但他们的主要任务是，清楚地在他们内表明所有人与生俱来的某些能力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:12.) The same kinds of dramas in different ways have been given, and while the drama is always different, it is always the same. This does not mean that a Christ has appeared within each system of reality. It means that the idea of God has manifested within each system in a way that is comprehensible to the inhabitants.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:12)不同方式的同样戏剧曾经演出过，虽然戏永远不同，却又永远是一样的。这并不表示在每一个实相系统里都出现了一个基督，而是在每一个系统内，“神”的概念都以当地居民所能理解的方式示现出来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This drama continues to exist. It does not belong, for example, to your past. Only you have placed it there. This does not mean that it always reoccurs. The drama, then, was far from meaningless, and the spirit of Christ, in your terms, is legitimate. It is the probable God-drama that you choose to perceive. There were others that were perceived, but not by you, and there are other such dramas existing now.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这戏仍继续存在着。它不属于，好比说，你们的过去。只不过你们把它放在那儿而已。这不表示它总在重演。那么，这场戏绝非无意义的，而以你们的话来说，基督的精神是合理的，它是你们选择去知觉到的可能“神”剧(probable God-Drama)。还有别的戏被知觉到，但不是被你们所知觉，现在也有其他这样的戏剧存在着。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:16. Jane’s trance had been deep. Her eyes were heavy at break, slow to open. “I knew he was keeping me out until I got a good lot of that material through,” she said. An hour and six minutes; this had been one of her longest trances. I told her I thought the material was excellent.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:16。珍的出神状态很深。在休息时，她的眼皮很沉重，睁不太开。“我知道他一直把我留在外面，直到我把那些资料差不多都弄过来了，才让我回来。”她说。一小时又六分钟，这是她最长的出神状态之一。我告诉她我认为这些资料非常好。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(As we talked, Jane recalled an image she’d had during the delivery. She couldn’t explain it very well, even with gestures. “Something like Christ being a central pole, with twelve balls revolving around him but radiating outward at the same time,” she said. “Christ created the twelve….”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在我们谈话时，珍回想起在传述时她有的一个意象，即使佐以手势她也没办法把它解释得很好。“像是基督做为一个中央支柱，有十二个球绕着他转，但同时又向外放光，”她说，“基督创造那十二个……”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(So far, Seth has named two out of the three personalities making up the Christ entity ---- Himself, obviously, and John the Baptist.* Resume at 10:37.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(到目前为止，赛斯说了造成基督存有的三个人之中的两个名字——显然的，基督自己，以及施洗约翰〔参看《灵界的讯息》第十八章〕。在10:37继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Whether or not the Crucifixion occurred physically, it was a psychic event, and exists as do all the other events connected with the drama.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：不论“钉十字架”有没有实质地发生，它是个心灵事件，与所有其他和此剧相关的事件一样地存在着。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Many were physical but some were not. The psychic event affected your world quite as much as the physical one, as is obvious. The whole drama occurred as a result of mankind’s need. It was created as a result of that need, grew out of it, but it did not originate within your system of reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>许多事件是实质的，但有些不是。心灵事件与实质事件影响你们的世界一样多，这是显而易见的。这整出戏因着人类的需要而产生，它是由于那个需要而被创造出来、生长出来，但它不是源起于你们的实相系统。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:41.) Other religions were based upon different dramas, in which ideas were acted out in a way that was comprehensible to various cultures. Unfortunately, the differences between the dramas often led to misunderstandings, and these were used as excuses for wars. These dramas are also privately worked out in the dream state. The God-personified figures first were introduced to man in the dream state, and the way then prepared.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:41停顿。)其他的宗教建基于不同的戏剧，在其中概念的演出是因应各种不同文化所能理解的方式。不幸的是，这些戏剧间的不同常常导致误解，而被用来作为战争的借口。这些戏剧也在个人的梦境里演出。神的化身人物首先在人的梦境里出现，于是准备了道路。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In visions and inspirations, men knew that the Christ drama would be enacted and hence recognized it for what it was when it occurred physically. Its power and strength then returned to the dream universe. It had increased its vigor and intensity through the physical materialization. In private dreams, men then related to the main figures in the drama, and in the dream state they recognized its true import.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在灵视(visions)与灵感里，人们知道基督的戏剧即将演出，因此当它实质地发生时，人们就认出了它的本质，它的威力与力量之后又回到了梦的宇宙，经过物质的具体化增加了它的活力与强度。在个人的梦里，人然后再与戏中的主要人物相联系，而在梦境他们认识了它的真正重要性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: God is more than the sum of all the probable systems of reality he has created, and yet he is within each one of these, without exception. He is therefore within each man and woman. He is also within each spider, shadow, and frog, and this is what man does not like to admit.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，“神”比所有祂创造出来的可能实相系统之总和还要大，祂却又在这些实相的每一个里面，无一例外。因此祂在每个男人与女人里，祂也在每个蜘蛛、阴影与青蛙里，而这是人所不愿承认的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>God can only be experienced, and you experience him whether or not you realize it, through your own existence. He is not male or female, however, and I use the terms only for convenience’s sake. In the most inescapable truth, he is not human in your terms at all, nor in your terms is he a personality. Your ideas of personality are too limited to contain the multitudinous facets of his multidimensional existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“神”只能被体验被感受到，而不论你知与不知，你都由你自己的存在体验到它。可是，神既非男性也非女性，我用这些名词只为了方便之故。在最不可逃避的真理中，祂以你们的话来说根本“非人”，祂也非一个人格。你们对人格的概念太狭窄了，不足以容纳祂多次元存在的多重面目。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:55.) On the other hand, he is human, in that he is a portion of each individual; and within the vastness of his experience he holds an “idea-shape” of himself as human, to which you can relate. He literally was made flesh to dwell among you, for he forms your flesh in that he is responsible for the energy that gives vitality and validity to your private multidimensional self, which in turn forms your image in accordance with your own ideas.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:55)由另一方面来说，祂是人，就在于祂是每个人的一部分，而在祂广大的经验里，祂保有一个祂自己做为人的“概念形”(idea-shape)，你可与之有关联。祂真正是做成人身居于你们之中，因为祂造成了你们的肉身，就在于祂对那给你“私人的多次元自己”(private multidimensional self)活力与确实性(validity)的能量负责，这个“自己”又转而按照你自己的概念形成你的形象。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This private multidimensional self, or the soul, has then an eternal validity. It is upheld, supported, maintained by the energy, the inconceivable vitality, of All That Is.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这私人的多次元自己，或这灵魂，于是有一个永恒的确实性。它被“一切万有”的能量与不可思议的活力所维护支持。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:00.) It cannot be destroyed then, this inner self of yours, nor can it be diminished. It shares in those abilities that are inherent within All That Is. It must, therefore, create as it is created, for this is the great giving that is behind all dimensions of existence, the spilling-over from the fountain of All That Is.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:00)那么，你的这个内我不能被毁灭，也不能被减损。它分享了“一切万有”与生俱有的那些能力。因此必须去创造，就如它被创造出来那样，因为这是在所有存在次元后的伟大天赋，由“一切万有”的泉源溢出的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now we will end our session.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在我们结束我们的课。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Okay. lt’s been very good.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的。说的太好了！”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>That body of material comes as one pattern, and we shall add others to it. I am finished with dictation. I will end the session unless you have any questions….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那一大团的资料先做为一个模型，我们将对它有所增益。我的口述完了。除非你有问题，不然我将结束此节……。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I did have a couple of questions pertaining to Jane and her dreams. Seth answered these, then ended the session at 11:09 P.M.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我确有一两个关于珍和她的梦的问题。赛斯答复了之后，在11:09结束。)</a>
