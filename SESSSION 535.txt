<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 534,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第534节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>JUNE 8, 1970, 9:05 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1970年6月8日 星期一 晚上9：05</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(No session was held last Wednesday, June 3.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(上星期三，6月3日，没有课。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(At 8:30 tonight Jane and I discussed Seth’s progress on his book. Jane was somewhat concerned. She wasn’t reading the book now, but she realized Seth wasn’t following, literally, the outline he’d given for it before he began dictating it chapter by chapter. I told her I thought Seth was presenting it just as he wanted it done; she agreed that she might as well relax and just let it come out.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(今晚8:30的时候，珍和我讨论赛斯写书的进度。珍有些担心。她现在不再阅读这本书，但她领会到，赛斯没有实在地遵照他在开始一章章口述前所给的大纲。我告诉她，我想赛斯是以他所想要的样子来写；她同意她不如放轻松而就让它出来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I would now like to describe two effects, one of Jane’s and one of mine, that took place almost simultaneously some few minutes before the session began. In addition, my experience blended into another one after the session started ---- but more about that later.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我现在想描写两种效应，一种是珍的，一种是我的，两者在课开始的几分钟前几乎同时发生。再者，我的经验与课开始后的另一种效应混合了起来——但以后再说那个。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(1.?As we sat waiting for the session to begin, Jane told me that the face of Joseph, in my oil painting of Ruburt and Joseph,* smiled down at her from its spot on the living room wall. When Jane became aware of the smiling effect she looked away from the painting, then quickly back at it. The effect was still there, she said; it lasted for perhaps two minutes, until just before session time at 9.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(一、当我们坐着等课开始，珍告诉我，在我画的“鲁柏与约瑟”油画中，约瑟的脸正由客厅墙上他所在之处对着她微笑。当珍知觉到那微笑时，她把眼光由油画挪开，然后很快地看回去。那效应仍在，她说：它持续了也许有两分钟，直到九点课快开始前才消失。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane faced the painting as she sat in her Kennedy rocker, but my back was to it because of my position on the couch. During the several times I turned to look at it I noticed nothing out of the ordinary. Jane told me that Joseph, representing my own entity, smiled broadly at her in a way the painting actually doesn’t. The expression in the eyes changed first, the smile spreading from them down to the mouth. The forehead didn’t move. It was as though the painting became abruptly alive, although the painted head of Ruburt did not change.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(当珍坐在她的甘迺迪摇椅中时，正面对那幅画，但因我坐在沙发上，我是背对着它的。在我几次转身去看的时候，我没看到任何不正常的事。珍告诉我，代表我自己本体的约瑟给她一个大大的、画本身实际并没有的笑容。眼睛的表情首先改变，笑容由眼向下散布到嘴。前额没动。就好像画像突然活了起来，虽然鲁柏画像的头并没有改变。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane doesn’t particularly like the painting, and has never seen this change in it before.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍并不特别喜欢这幅画，以前也从未在上面看到这种改变。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(2.?My effect concerns an interference in my vision, without an actual loss of sight. It produced no aftereffects this evening, nor had it ever in earlier years beyond a very slight headache. Tonight I didn’t get the headache. Strangely I’ve never been alarmed by this phenomenon. With my somewhat secretive nature I’d had no urge, even as a child, to tell my parents about it, or to see a doctor. The absence of aftereffects, and the continued clarity of mymental processes, may have been reassuring.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(二、我的效应是关于我视觉上的一个干扰，并没真正失去视力。今晚它并没有产生后遗症，在以前那些年也没有，除了很轻的头疼之外。今晚我没头疼。奇怪的是，我从未对这现象感到紧张。由于我有些爱守秘密的天性，即使在孩提时，我也没有把这件事告诉父母或去看医生的冲动。后来没有后遗症，以及我的神智一直保持清晰，也许是使我心安的原因。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The effect, which always reminded me of a mirage, began with a smallish, bright sawtooth pattern of light just to the right of my direct line of vision. Now, with memory of almost-forgotten episodes returning, I knew that this brilliant, shimmering pattern could spread so that as I looked at an object it would be obliterated, even while I still had peripheral vision.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(这效应总是使我想到海市蜃楼，刚开始在我直接视线偏右方有一小而亮的锯齿状的光。现在，我又忆起了那几乎已忘了的事，我知道这灿烂、闪闪发光的形状会展开，以致它会遮住我看的东西，虽然我还保有外圈的视觉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(At times the interference had covered a wide enough area so that I had a difficult time seeing the drawing paper before me, for instance, or the pencil I felt in my hand. The shimmering varied in intensity. On one occasion I lay down and closed my eyes simply because it was easier to do this than anything else. Such effects lasted half an hour at the most, usually less.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(有时这干扰笼罩了一片相当大的区域，因此我很难看到，举例来说，眼前的画纸，或手上的笔。闪光的强度不定。有一回我躺下来，闭上眼睛，因为反正做不成任何别的事。此种效应最多持续半小时，多半要短些。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Now, I wondered once again at my calm response to this as I grew up ---- to something whose origins were so completely outside any kind of knowledge I possessed. When the interference had been strong, covering most of the field of vision, I had experienced a peculiar sense of both darkness and light, with the objective world indistinguishable within what I can only describe as a field of patterned, alternating lightness and darkness that possessed a velvety depth.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(现在，我再一次对我对这事——它的源起完全不为我所知——一向的镇静反应感到奇怪。以前当干扰强大到遮住了大半的视野时，我曾体验到一种又暗又亮的奇特感觉，客观世界与具有丝绒般深度的、光暗交替的茫茫，一大片图案混在一起而无法区别了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Tonight’s experience wasn’t that intense. I first realized its onset at about 8:50, and at once began to give myself suggestions to minimize it because I didn’t want to alarm Jane by delaying the session. At the same time Jane began to describe the smile she perceived in the painting; I could see the painting well enough when she asked me to check it, although my vision effect was still building. My suggestions were very beneficial, though, and by session time at 9:05 I realized that not only had my experience gone as “far” as it was going to go, but also that it was on the retreat. By 9:15 the last traces of it were gone and my vision was clear.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(今晚的经验不是那么强烈。我首先发觉它的开始是在大约8:50时，我立即给自己暗示以尽量减低它，因为我不想要因延迟上课而使珍焦虑不安。同时珍开始形容她在画上看到的微笑；当她叫我核对一下时，我能清楚地看到那幅画，虽然我的视觉效应仍在增强。然而我的暗示很有用，到9:05上课时，我领悟到不但我的经验已达到它要去的最“远”处，而且还正在撤退。到9:15，它连最后的痕迹也没了，我的视力清楚了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(There is more to follow; for as this experience waned it was replaced, or led into, an event of a different kind. This one was new to me, and most interesting. Subsequent notes, and Seth himself, explain what transpired as the session progressed. I’ll say here that the new effect involved the gradual loss of my ability first to spell, and then to write….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(好戏还在后头；因为在这经验减弱时，它被取代了，或导入了另一个不同的事件。这个事件对我而言是新鲜而又最有趣的。接下去的注和赛斯本人在课进行当中都解释了这件事。我在这儿先说，新的效应涉及了我的逐渐失去拼字能力，然后是失去书写能力……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane began to speak for Seth at quite a slow pace, in contrast to her faster rate of recent sessions. As the session began I had to make a little bit of an effort to see the page clearly in order to write.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍开始以缓慢的步调替赛斯说话，与她近来一些课的较快步调适成对比。当课开始我必须稍费一点力来看清纸张以便写字。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Just before the session I had commented on the peaceful evening, which was very warm.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在课刚开始前我曾评论说今夜很平静，天气很暖和。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I hope I do not shatter your peace.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我希望我没有打破你的平静。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“No.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“没有”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will resume dictation. (Pause; one of many.) Consciousness has many characteristics, some of course known to you. Many of the characteristics of consciousness, however, are not so apparent, since presently you largely use your own consciousness in such a way that its perceptions appear in quite other than “natural” guises. You are aware of your own consciousness, in other words, through the medium of your own physical mechanism. You are not nearly as aware of your own consciousness when it is not operating primarily through the mediumship of the body, as it does in out-of-body states and some dissociated conditions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们再继续口述。(停顿，许多次中之一。)意识有许多特性，你们当然已知道某一些，不过，还有许多并不那么明显，因为你目前大半以这样一种方式用你的意识，以致其知觉显得十分不“自然”的样子。换言之，你透过自己的肉体机制来知觉你的意识。当你的意识不经由身体的媒介来运作，如它在“出体”及一些“解离”(dissociated)情况时，你对它就不大知觉了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(By the time I wrote the last sentence I was aware ---- again, without being upset ---- that it was taking me just a little longer than usual to come up with my abbreviations or symbols for such common words as “does,” “as,” and “even.” This action of course should have been automatic. But visual interference was now lifting considerably.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(到我写最后一句时，我觉察到——仍然没有感到不安——我得花比平时较长一点的时间。才想得起我对这种常用的字眼如“是”、“如”、“甚至”等的简写或代号。这动作当然本该是自动的。不过视觉上的干扰现在已消散得差不多了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(By 9:12 I began to spell an occasional word incorrectly. To show what was happening I’m including, in parentheses after the corrected word, some of the mistakes my notes contain.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(到9:12我开始偶尔拼错一字。为了让你们明白所发生的事，我把我的笔记所包含的一些错误放在改正的字后括号里。(译注：英文为“拼音”文字，中文则否，故原文拼音之错误无法如实表达。罗听见某字无误但手不从心或一时想不起正确拼法。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The characteristics of consciousness are the same (seme) whether you are in a body or outside of one. The peaks and valleys of consciousness that I mentioned exist to some degree in all consciousness despite the form adopted (adepted) after death (deth). The nature of your consciousness is no different basically (bascially) than it is now, though you may not be aware of many of its characteristics.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不论你在身体内或外，意识的特性都是一样(相)的。不论在死(此)后意识所采取(去)的形相为何。我所提及的意识的峰与谷，多少都存在于所有的意识内。你意识的本质基本(笨)上与它现在的没什么不同，纵使你也许不知觉它的许多特性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I caught myself omitting the word “not” from the last sentence, and was quite aware by now that something was up. More and more I had to make a deliberate effort to get the notes down correctly. In the material below, I couldn’t think of some of the symbols I used and had to write the words out.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我捉到自己由最后一句中省略了“不”字，到现在我已很明白有点不对劲了。我越来越得有意的努力以写下正确的笔记。在以下的资料中，我想不起我惯用的一些代号而必须写出本字来。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now your consciousness is telepathic and clairvoyant, for example, even though you may not realize it. In sleep when (whene) you often presume yourself to be unconscious (unconsious) you may be far more conscious than you are now, but simply using abilities of consciousness that you do not accept as real or valid (valed) in waking (waping) life. You therefore shut (shup) them out of your conscious experience (experiencl). Consciousness, yours and mine, is quite independent of both (poth) time and space. And after death you are simply aware of the greater powers of consciousness that exist within you all the time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如，你的意识具有他心通和千里眼，纵使你也许并不知道。在睡眠中当(常)你常假设你自己是无意识(思)时，你也许比你现在还有意识得多，却只是在用你在醒(星)时生活里不接受为真的或有效(笑)的意识能力而已。所以你把它们关(干)在你意识经验(院)之外。不论是你的或我的意识，都十分独立于时间与空间两(量)者之外。在死后你只是觉察到，一直在你内在的意识的更大威力罢了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:21. I had a lot of trouble getting the following sentences down. Many of the words were misspelled, some so much so that I crossed them out and quickly tried again ---- with the humorous result that the corrections also contained errors. My vision was by now very clear.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:21。我写下以下的句子极感困难。许多字拼错了，有些错得这么厉害，我把它们划掉，赶紧再试——而改正过的也含有错误的幽默结果，到现在我的视觉已非常清楚了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(For the first time I conceded to myself that perhaps I ought to ask Seth to slow down, while realizing his pace was slow to begin with. I didn’t ask him what was happening. That worthy stared at me through Jane’s eyes without a sign that anything unusual might be taking place in the session….)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我第一次对自己认输，想想也许我该请赛斯讲慢一点，但同时却领悟到他的步调本来就很慢。我没问他到底是怎么回事。那个大人物透过珍的眼睛看着我，毫无在课间发生了任何不平常的事的征兆……)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Since they do, of course, you can discover them now and learn to use them. This will directly (dreactly) assist you in after-death (agter) experience. You will not be nearly so startled by the nature of your own reactions (reactone) if you understand beforehand for example that your consciousness not only is not imprisoned by your physical body, but (bud) can create other portions at will. Those who “overidentify” their consciousness with their body can suffer self-created torment (tortment) for no reason, lingering about the body. Indeed, quite the forlorn soul, thinking it has no other place to go.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当然，既然意识有那些能力，你现在就能发现它们并且学着用它们。这对你的死后经历会有直接(切)的帮助，如果你在事前了解，举例来说，你的意识不只是不被你的肉体所囚禁，而且(解)能随意创造其他的部分，你就不会被自己的反应(映)的性质吓那么一大跳。那些将他们意识与他们身体“过分认同”的人，会无故地受到自己所创造出的折磨，留连在尸体旁。的确，它们是相当绝望的灵魂，以为自己没有别的地方可去。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(For “beforehand” in the paragraph above, I wrote “byeborehoune,” then crossed that out and tried twice more. I now made a determined effort to spell correctly and write clearly. It helped. It was something like coming out of a deep sleep and immediately making a strong effort to focus in physical reality.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在以上的一段，“事前”我写成“司间”，然后划掉它再试了两次。我现在决意努力拼得正确、写得清楚。有进步。有些像刚由沉睡中醒来而立刻费力地聚焦于物质实相。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You are, as I said earlier, a spirit now; and that spirit has a consciousness. The consciousness belongs to the spirit then, but the two are not the same. The spirit may turn its consciousness off and on. By its nature consciousness may flicker and fluctuate, but the spirit does not.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如我以前所说，你现在是一个灵，那灵拥有一个意识。那么，这意识属于这灵，但两者却不是一样的，灵可以把它的意识打开或关闭。意识的天性可能会闪烁消长，但灵则否。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I do not particularly like the word “spirit” because of several implications attached to it, but it (ot) suits our purposes in that the word does imply an independence from physical form.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我并不顶喜欢“灵”这字，因为它附有几种暗示，但它(宅)适合我们的目的，因为这字的确暗示与实质形体无干。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Consciousness does not refresh itself in sleep. It is merely turned in another direction. Consciousness does not sleep then in those terms and while it may be turned off it is not like a light.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>意识并不在睡眠中恢复精神，它只是转到其他的方向。那么说，意识是不眠的，而它虽可以被关掉，却并不是像一盏灯一样。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:28. The difficulty I had been experiencing with my spelling abruptly returned to an even greater degree. Along with the misspellings and the crossing out of words, I now had to worry about simply keeping up with Seth’s rather slow pace. For the first time I thought of asking for a break, yet I still wasn’t alarmed. I had trouble with the whole paragraph.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:28。我刚才经验的拼字困难突然变本加厉地回来了。当我一边拼错一边划掉那些字的同时，我还得担心去赶上赛斯相当慢的步调。这是头一回我想要请求休息，却仍没惊惶。一整段我都有困难。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Turning it off does not extinguish (expetnrise) it in the way that a light (like) disappears (disappeares) when a switch is turned. Following the analogy (aneleogy), if consciousness were (werse) like (light) a light that belonged (belenge) to you, even when you switched it off, there would be a sort of twilight, but not darkness (darkners).</a>
<a id=1 href=1>关上意识并没有熄灭(咩)它，像关上开关，一个光(关)就消失(矢)了一样。随着这比(必)喻，如果意识是(司)像(象)一个属(数)于你的光，即使当你关上它，那儿仍会有一种微光，而非黑暗。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(By now I was sitting tensely on the edge of our couch, bending over the notebook as it lay on the coffee table before me. This is a position I seldom use ---- perhaps I thought it would help me really grapple with this experience. I asked Seth to wait a minute.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(到现在我已紧张得坐到沙发的边上，弯身于我面前咖啡桌上的笔记本。这是个我极少用的姿势——也许我以为这会帮我与这个经验搏斗。我请赛斯等一分钟。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The spirit, therefore, is never in a state of nothingness, with its consciousness extinguished. It is very important therefore that such be realized, for there …</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，灵永不在它的意识被熄灭了的虚无状态。所以，了解这点非常要紧，因为……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The rest of the sentence is unintelligible in my notes. Here is the way I actually wrote it: “The spirit tre is never n a state of nethigness, with its conscescness x x extenigly. It os very important tre thanch be realize, fr thre if ech expct if a sctich it is …”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在我的笔记上，余下的句子却看不清楚了。都成了蟹形文字。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(In considerable surprise I asked Seth to wait once more. I missed a couple of sentences here, and very nearly gave up trying to take notes. I thought of one more try, however. Jane, as Seth, sat waiting rather noncommittally, eyes open.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我相当惊讶地请赛斯再等一等。在这儿我遗漏了一两句，而几乎要放弃记录了。不过，我还想再试一次，珍身为赛斯，不置可否地坐着等，眼睛是睁开的。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It is very important to understand that consciousness is never extinguished….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>了解意识永不熄灭是非常重要的……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:35. Again I quickly fell way behind. When I found myself writing “ichstantale” for “extinguished,” I gave up and asked Seth for a break. It came at once. I was nonplussed. I was clearheaded but unable, literally, to continue taking notes. Still I wasn’t alarmed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:35。我又一次很快地落后了很多。当我发现自己把“熄灭”写成了“熄减”，我放弃了，请求赛斯暂停一下。他马上停下来。我非常困惑，我头脑清楚，却真的无法继续笔录了。我仍旧不觉惊恐。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(When I started to explain to Jane why I had to stop, I discovered that on top of everything else I was having trouble speaking coherently. Seth then returned briefly, with a broad smile. From memory I recall his saying:)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(当我开始对珍解释我为何必须停下来时，我才发现除了所有这些事之外，我还没办法前后连贯地讲话。然后赛斯短短地回来了一下，带着一个大大的笑容。我记得他说：)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You have been acting out the material this evening, Joseph….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>约瑟，你今晚是在演出这资料……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(With those words understanding came quickly, although the effects didn’t lift that easily. I made many errors talking to Jane, but the vocal difficulty never matched that of the spelling or writing. At first Jane was very concerned at my experiences before and during the session; she told me later that at this point she almost decided not to continue the session. She finally believed my reassurances, however, and realized that I was all right physically.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(听了这话我马上了解了，虽然那效应没那么容易消散。和珍说话时我犯了许多错误，但说话的困难永远比不上拼字或写字的困难。一开始珍对我在课前与课间的经验觉得很担心；她后来告诉我，在这一刻她几乎决定不再继续上课。但她终于相信我的一再保证而明白我身体没毛病。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth suspended dictation on his book at my request, but during a brief interlude suggested that I have Jane turn on the rest of the lights in the room when she came out of trance. Then, I was to imagine my consciousness growing brighter and brighter, filling the room like light; I would find that all of my abilities would soon return. I wasn’t able to remember some subsequent information.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯应我的要求暂时中止口述，但在一个短短的休息当中建议，当珍在回神之后，我让她打开房中所有的灯。然后，我想象我的意识越来越亮，像光一样充满了房间；我会发现我所有的能力很快就回来了。接下去的一些资料我就记不得了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Thus, I had experienced altered states of seeing, writing, spelling, and speaking this evening ---- all facets of course of my physical means of communication. Sitting in the glare of the brilliantly lit room, I described everything in detail to Jane, including the vision effects of earlier years. She wondered if my loss of communicative abilities was also related to my father’s senility and his own physical retreat. I didn’t know. I hadn’t experienced anything unusual involving him recently.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(就这样，今晚我经历了看、写、拼字和说话的变换状态——当然，全是我具体沟通方法的面向。坐在灯火通明的房中，我向珍详尽地描述每件事，包括早年的视觉效应。她在猜我的失去沟通能力是否与我父亲的老化及肉体的退化有关。我不知道。近来我和他之间并没有发生任何不寻常的事。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Slowly I resumed work on my notes. I was most anxious that Seth explain all. And he was right: by 10:30 I was much better. I caught up on the notes finally and told Jane I was ready for the session to continue. Now we received the most interesting data of all ---- that pertaining to my curious lack of alarm at the events of the evening. Resume at a faster pace at 10:47.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(慢慢地我又开始修整笔记。我非常盼望赛斯解释这一切。他是对的，到10:30我已好多了。最后我补好了笔记，告诉珍我已准备好继续上课，现在我们收到顶有趣的资料——是关于我对今晚的事件感觉这么奇怪却一点也不恐慌。在10:47以快些的步调重新开始。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: In the demonstration in which Joseph so kindly assisted us, several points were made to implement the material just given.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在约瑟这么好心帮忙的示范演出中，把刚才给的资料实现了好几点。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Earlier I said that you are only familiar with those characteristics of your own consciousness that you use through the mediumship of the body. You rely upon the body to express the perceptions of your consciousness. You tend, again, to identify the expression of your consciousness with the body.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>早些我说过，你只熟悉透过身体媒介来运用你自己意识的那些特性。你依赖身体来表达你意识的感知。再者，你倾向于把意识的表达与身体认同。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In our demonstration, to which of course Joseph gave his permission, he allowed his consciousness to retreat, and to some degree began to cut off its physical expression. He was not aware consciously of his permission, simply because this kind of demonstration could not be held if the normal waking consciousness knew. It would automatically be frightened. As I spoke about the dimming of consciousness, Joseph then experienced it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在我们的示范中——当然是约瑟同意去做的——约瑟允许他的意识撤退，并且到某个程度开始切断了它在身体上的表达。在意识上，他并不觉知他的同意，只因为如果正常的醒时意识知道的话，它一定会害怕，这种表演就无法演出了。当我说到意识变模糊的时候，约瑟就经历到它。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:55. This may be a tricky point, and it may not. Seth used the word “dimming.” Certainly some of my abilities for physical expression had withdrawn considerably, yet I had remained clearheaded and alert, and, out of habit, thoroughly occupied with trying to use them…. Nor had I become aware of any kind of heightened consciousness, or sudden telepathic or clairvoyant powers.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:55。这可能是个诡谲处，也可能不是。赛斯用“变模糊”这个字。固然我身体有些表达能力退缩了不少，我却还保持头脑清醒而警觉，并且，出自习惯，满脑子都是想用它们的念头……我也没觉察到有任何一种的意识升高，或突然的他心通或千里眼能力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Now, I was having no trouble taking notes.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(现在，我记笔记没有困难了。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Give us a moment. This was an exercise, actually, in the manipulation of consciousness. Close to death, this same sort of thing happens in varying degrees when the consciousness realizes that it can no longer express itself through the mediumship of the body. If the dying person overidentifies with the body then he can easily panic, thinking that all expression is therefore cut off, and for that matter that his consciousness is about to be extinguished.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>给我们一会儿。实际上，这是一个对意识的操纵练习。临终时，这类事以深浅不同的程度发生，那时意识领悟到它不再能藉身体的媒介来表达自己。如果临终者过分与肉体认同，那么他就很容易惊慌失措，以为所有的表达就此切断了，而由此他的意识也就快要熄灭了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Such a belief in extinction, such a certainty that identity is about to be blotted out in the next moment, is a severe psychological experience, that in itself can bring about unfortunate reactions. What happens instead is that you find consciousness quite intact, and its expression far less limited than it was before. Joseph chose subconsciously to interrupt those methods of expression he was using at the time simply so that their interference would claim due notice.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这种对灭绝的相信，这种对本体即将在下一刻被消灭的确信，是一个严酷的心理经验，它本身就可能带来不幸的反应。结果相反的，你发现意识根本是完整的，而它的表达比以前还要不受限制得多。约瑟潜意识地选择了去干扰那种他当时正在用的表达方法，只因它们的干扰会引起应得的注意。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will be dealing now, after what I hope is suitable background material, with some chapters on the nature of existence after physical death, at the point of death, and involving the final physical death at the end of the reincarnational cycle. It was important that you understand something about the nature and behavior of your own consciousness before we could begin.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在我给了这个我希望是合宜的背景资料之后，我们现在所要做的是，以几章来谈谈在肉体死亡之后及死亡当时，存在的本质为何，并涉及在轮回完毕后，肉体最后一次的死亡。在我们能够开始之前，对你自己意识的本质与行为有一些了解是很重要的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take a break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:06. Jane’s pace had been considerably faster this time. In the last paragraph, I had a bit of difficulty spelling just two words. Resume more slowly at 11:20.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:06。珍的步调这次快了不少。在前一段，我只对其中两个字的拼法略感困难。在11:20较慢的继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: You also drew upon some knowledge, Joseph, from past experience in our demonstration, when in your final illness motor function was impaired. This was in Denmark. The last note is an aside, rather than strict dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>约瑟，在我们的示范里，你也用到了过去经验中所汲取的一些知识，那是当你前生在丹麦，在最后一场病中运动机能受到伤害时。最后这句是题外话，而非纯粹的口述。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(According to Seth, the three of us were involved in Denmark in the 1600’s. I was a landowner, Jane was my son, and Seth was a spice merchant. See Chapter Twenty-two.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(按赛斯说，我们三人在十七世纪的丹麦曾有过关系。我是个地主，珍是我的儿子，赛斯是个香料商人。见第二十二章。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now I am ending this chapter, and with it I am ending Part One of my book. Give us a moment now ---- and end of dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在我结束这一节，随之结束我的书的第一部。现在给我们一会儿——口述到此结束。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(But Seth wasn’t through work on his book yet. The following material shows the relationship between my vision effects and the events in the session itself. It’s very interesting that I would choose tonight, of all nights, to try for visual data, although in recent days I’ve been inquiring mentally about subjects for my next oil painting. I haven’t said anything about this to Jane.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(但赛斯还没做完他写书的工作，以下的资料显示我的视觉效应与在这一节里所发生事件的关系。极有趣的是，在所有的夜晚里，我会选中今晚来设法获得视觉资料，虽然近日来我心中一直在自问下一幅画的主题为何。我没对珍提过这事。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The earlier vision experiences were unsuccessful preliminary attempts on an unconscious level to pick up images of models for your paintings. In the blurred dark portion, the models would have appeared. Do you follow me?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>早先的视觉经验是潜意识层面上不成功的初步尝试，想为你的画去找出一些模特儿的形象。在模糊的黯黑部分，模特儿应会出现，你懂吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我懂。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The blurred areas represented a confusion of vibrations. You could not get the material visually in physical terms, though you were trying to, but you could not receive it as internal vision either at that point. Instead you ended up almost with a displacement. There was always a sense of motion in the background that was interpreted visually as an unsteadiness, a massing of blurs.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>视野里模糊的地方代表了一种振动的混乱。你无法实际地以肉眼得到资料，虽然你一直试着去做，但在那一点你也无法以一个内在视象的样子接收到它，反之，结果你差一点得到一个代替品。在背景里永远有一种动的感觉，视觉上便被诠释为一种不稳定，一片模糊。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you acquiesced in our experiment earlier this evening, when Ruburt and you spoke at the [supper] table. Ruburt was telepathically aware of the arrangement, though not at a conscious level. The smiling portrait that Jane saw was your work in a way. Ruburt was aware of the arrangement for the demonstration, but was also somewhat alarmed at the particular way you would choose to interpret the experience. The smiling portrait was to reassure her ---- Jane now rather than Ruburt. You sent the reassurance. Ruburt picked it up from Joseph. Do you follow me?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在，今晚早些时候，当鲁柏和你在(晚)餐桌上谈话时，你默许了我的实验。鲁柏心电感应地知觉到这个安排，虽然不是在有意识的层面。在某方面说，珍所见的微笑画像是你搞出来的。鲁柏对这示范演出的安排是有知觉的，但对你会选择来诠释这个经验的特定方法多少有些担心，带笑的画像是要向她——珍而非鲁柏——保证没有问题。你发出了那个保证，而鲁柏由约瑟处接到了它。你懂吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.” And a very effective method, I thought.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“懂。”我想是个非常有效的方法。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: I will close for this evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，今晚我要结束了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“It’s been very interesting.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“今晚很有趣。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I thank you for your assistance. A hearty good evening to you both.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>谢谢你从旁协助。祝你俩晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:36 P.M. “Good night, Seth.” Again, I had minor trouble spelling a few words after the last break. That was all.) * For illustrations of this painting, see The Seth Material.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:36。“赛斯晚安。”我在最后一次休息后，在拼几个字上又碰上小小的困难，只此而已。)</a>
