<tr><td>SESSION 240</td><td>第240节第66次信封实验用作标的物的AAA会员卡描摹图</td></tr><tr><td>MARCH 9, 1966 9 PM WEDNESDAY AS SCHEDULED</td><td>1966年3月9日 星期三 晚上9点 定期课</td></tr><tr><td>(The 39th envelope experiment was held during the session; see the tracing of the AAA membership card used as the object on page 1. Some interesting and hilarious results were obtained in the connections made by Seth/Jane.</td><td>(第39次信封实验在课间举行，见上面以AAA[American Automobile Association，美国汽车协会]会员卡当作标的物的描摹图。赛斯－珍提出的关联得到一些令人捧腹的有趣结果。</td></tr><tr><td>(Before this evenings session I was at work typing up the envelope data for last Monday's session. I stopped at 8:30 PM to get ready for this session at 9 PM. I began to be aware of a rather stiff pain growing in the back of my neck. By 8:45 it was quite bothersome, so I returned to the studio in the back of the apartment, to use the pendulum for a quick check to see if I could learn the cause. I did not think it physical.</td><td>(在今晚这节之前，我为上周一的信封资料做打字工作。晚上8:30分，我停下来，为9点的这一节做准备。我开始察觉到后头有点僵硬疼痛，而且逐渐加剧。到了8:45分，已经痛得挺扰人得了，所以我回到公寓后方的画室，用摆钟快速查对一下，看看我能不能知道原因。我认为不是身体的问题。</td></tr><tr><td>( I became absorbed in the task, and had just obtained the answer when Jane called me from the front room at 8:55. I hadn’t mentioned the pain to her, deciding on the spur of the moment to see if Seth could also pinpoint the trouble during the session. Nor did Jane know I was using the pendulum. When I took my seat at our table in the living room just before 9 PM.  Jane told me she had felt surprisingly nervous at my absence so close to the session; hence her calling to me. She also felt a definite irritation, but did not know its source, or who or what the target was.</td><td>(我全神贯注在这件事情上，才刚得到答案，珍就在前面的房间喊停了，时间是8:55分。我没跟她提起我的疼痛，而是一时心血来潮决定，看看赛斯在课间能不能也准确描述这个毛病。此外珍也不知道我在用摆钟。刚好9点整之前，我来到我们的客厅，在桌边坐下，珍告诉我，上课时间马上就到了，我却不在，她有出乎意料的紧张之感；所以她才会喊了我。她也感觉到一种明确的烦躁，但不知道起因为何，也不晓得是针对什么人或什么事。</td></tr><tr><td>(The session was held in our front room. Jane began speaking while sitting down. She was not smoking and her eyes were closed. Once again her pace was quite slow, and broken by some long pauses.)</td><td>(这节在我们前面的房间举行。珍一边坐下来一边开始讲话。她没有抽烟，双眼闭着。再一次她的速度相当缓慢，时而停顿良久。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth. ’)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Sooner or later we are going to have to discuss the ways in which what would appear to be sensual. Perception is made available to an individual when the physical body, with its senses, perceives an event at which it cannot be said to be present.</td><td>现在。迟早我们需要讨论到某些情形，在其中个人似乎能够接收到感官觉知，而他的身体及其感官，却不能说是处在它所感知的事件现场。</td></tr><tr><td>Unfortunately this will be somewhat complicated. More so than is at first apparent.</td><td>可惜，这会有一些复杂。比一开始的显而易见还要复杂。</td></tr><tr><td>I have told you that each individual creates physical matter, including objects, that he constructs his own physical image. Coherence, the illusion of permanency, placement in space, color and mass, all these are arrived at and agreed upon, in ways that I have clearly explained.</td><td>我告诉过你，每一个个体都会创造实体物质，包括物体在内，也说过他会建构自己的肉体形象。连贯性、永久不变的幻相、在空间的位置、颜色与质量，这些全部都以我已经清楚解释过的方式达成协议。</td></tr><tr><td>(In Volume 2, see the 60th to 73rdsessions, given during the summer of1964, plus many others.)</td><td>(在第二册，见1964年夏天给出的第60至73节，以及其他很多节。)</td></tr><tr><td>Telepathic communication is one of the methods by which such agreement is reached. Long ago, primary and secondary constructions were explained. I emphasized that each individual only perceives his own physical constructions.</td><td>心灵感应沟通是达成这种协议的方法之一。很久以前，已经解释过首要建构和次要建构。我强调每一个个体只能感知他自己的身体建构。</td></tr><tr><td>Basically there is no difference between precognition and telepathy. The apparent difference is the result of an inadequate understanding of the nature of time. The important fact is, in both cases, that information is received by an individual that does not come through recognized sense systems.</td><td>基本上，预知和心灵感应之间没有任何区别。明显的差异是对时间本质了解不足造成的结果。重要的事实是，在这两种情况下，一个个体接收到的讯息并非来自公认的感官系统。</td></tr><tr><td>This main issue is frequently overlooked, while emphasis is placed instead upon whether or not the information seems to be perceived from the present or future. When an individual—in quotes—“clairvoyantly sees”—end quotes—an event, this is what happens.</td><td>这个主要问题经常被忽视，重点反而放在，是不是从现在或未来感知讯息。当个体“透过千里眼看到”一个事件时，状况就是这个样子。</td></tr><tr><td>First of all, he forgets the concept of continual moments, which usually hampers his perception. His perception changes focus so that he is aware of an event that would otherwise be future for him. He constructs subconsciously, as always, material objects in line with the data that is available to him. It goes without saying then that he helps to construct the clairvoyantly perceived physical event, just as he helps to construct any physical event in the present.</td><td>首先，他忘记了连续时刻的概念，这个概念通常会妨碍他的感知。他的感知改变焦点，以便觉知一个若非如此对他而言就会是未来的事件。一如往常，他在潜意识里构建与他可用的资料一致的实物。于是不用说，他当然帮忙建构了千里眼感知的实质事件，就像他帮忙建构当下的任何实质事件一样。</td></tr><tr><td>The agreement as to physical dimensions and so forth is reached precisely in the same manner that it usually is. The only unusual issue, to you, should not be that the event has not yet occurred, but that John Jones for example, from his chair, has been sensually aware of a situation that is obviously beyond the reaches of his physical senses.</td><td>关于实际尺寸等等的协议，正是以通常如此的相同方式达成。对你而言，唯一不寻常的问题不应该是事件还没有发生，而是比方说约翰·琼斯(John Jones)在他的椅子上，已经透过感官觉察到一种明显超出他肉体感官可及的情况。</td></tr><tr><td>The self does not remain as permanently attached to the physical body as you imagine, during physical existence. The ego is much more dependent upon the physical self than are other portions of the personality. The physical body is more like a home station, from which frequent excursions are made. The ego is like a guardian who is left at home, as watchdog.</td><td>在物质存在期间，自己并不是你想像的那样永久依附着肉体。自我比人格的其他部分更依赖肉身自己。肉体更像是总站，由此出发从事频繁的短途旅行。自我就像留在家中的守护者。有如看门狗。</td></tr><tr><td>Sensual data is not basically—underlined—dependent upon the physical body. The individual can receive sensual data in other ways. The senses are indeed often used by the inner self as a constant method of acquainting it with circumstances pertinent to the survival and interests of the physical body, but the inner self is not entirely dependent on them for its entire data by any means. The mind can bypass the senses, and receive its data in a more direct manner, translating what it perceives as automatically as it translates sensual data.</td><td>感官资料基本上并不依附肉体。个体可以经由其他方式接收感官资料。内我其实经常利用感官，藉此不断熟悉肉体生存和利益相关的状况，但是内我绝非完全依赖它们的全部资料。心智可以绕过感官，以更直接的方式接收它的资料，像它翻译感官资料那样自动翻译它所感知的内容。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your first break.</td><td>我建议你第一次休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:30. Jane was dissociated as usual. Her eyes had opened but once, when she sipped some wine. Her pace had been better as the delivery progressed.</td><td>(9:30休息。珍像往常一样出离。她的眼睛只张开过一次，那时她喝了一点酒。随着传述的进行，她的速度越来越好。</td></tr><tr><td>( I now told Jane that as the session progressed I had more and more difficulty keeping “awake. ''Actually I began to notice a heavy lassitude, although I kept writing without trouble, and I recognized that I seemed to be in a trance state. At the same time, as I looked about the room, everything seemed to be in a sharper focus, and I had a feeling of more light in the room, although it was well lit to begin with. I began to wonder if I was responding to the material Seth was presenting; I had found it very interesting.</td><td>(我现在告诉珍，随着课的进行，我越来越难以保持“清醒”。其实，虽然我一直写笔记并没有困难，但我开始注意到一种严重的倦怠，而且我认得出来我似乎处于出神状态。同时，当我环顾房间时，每样东西好像都在一个更清晰的焦点之中，我感觉房间的光线更亮了，尽管一开始时它的照明就很充足。我开始怀疑我是不是在回应赛斯提出的资料；我觉得它非常有趣。</td></tr><tr><td>( I then remembered that in the 232nd session Seth had said I was in a light trance myself during sessions, as I made ",certain automatic adjustments in order to perceive what little of my presence that you do perceive. And I also have a calming effect on you, which is most beneficial to you.” See Volume 5, page 277. Recalling this, I wondered if I was not making a strong effort to perceive Seth, perhaps in apparition form, this evening; which meant that possibly he was present to a stronger degree than usual.</td><td>(然后我想起赛斯在第232节说过，我自己在课间处于一种轻微出神的状态，因为我做了“某些自动调整，以便感知你的确感知到的我那微乎其微的临在。而且我对你也有一种镇定的作用，这对你非常有益。”见第五册。想起这件事，我怀疑今晚我并没有为了感知赛斯，也许是显灵的他，而大费周章；这意味着他的临在程度可能大过于往常。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane said she too has experienced the seemingly contradictory effects of sleepiness or lethargy, and the sharper vision, during trance. Needless to say, I saw nothing unusual in my frequent glances about the room, nor did I notice any change in Janes features. The sensation was pronounced by the time break came, yet during break it disappeared. I have been aware of something like it, on a must reduced scale, many times during sessions.</td><td>(珍说，在出神期间，她也经历了昏昏欲睡或困倦乏力这些看似矛盾的效应，还有更清晰的视觉。不用说，我多次瞄一瞄房间四处，并没有看见什么异常，也没有察觉到珍的五官有任何变化。在休息时间到来之前，这个感觉变得很明显，可是在休息的时候，它就消失了。在课间我已经察觉到类似的状况很多次，当然程度小很多。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane once again resumed with her eyes closed, and at a little faster pace, at 9:37. A reminder: Seth calls for all underlined words.)</td><td>(9:37分，珍再次闭着眼睛继续传述，速度稍微加快一点。提醒一下：所有划线的字词都是赛斯要求的。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Under so-called usual circumstances, data is received through the physical senses, and is then interpreted by the brain.</td><td>现在。在所谓通常的情况下，透过肉体感官接收资料，然后经由大脑解读。</td></tr><tr><td>When a clairvoyant event is perceived the data is received by the mind and given to the brain, which then interprets it as it does usual data. The physical body becomes aware of it in other words, but the senses have been bypassed.</td><td>当千里眼事件被感知时，心智就会接收到资料并且提供给大脑，然后大脑再以处理一般资料那样来解读它。换句话说，肉体开始觉察到它，但是避开了感官。</td></tr><tr><td>The interpretation is made however in the same way as it is usually made. Otherwise the data would make no sense to the physical organism, and would not register. Actually much data perceived directly by the mind bypasses the physical organism completely.</td><td>然而，这种解读的方式与惯常的方式一样。否则，资料对物质有机体而言就没有意义了，也不会留下印象。实际上，心智直接感知的资料很多都完全避开物质有机体。</td></tr><tr><td>The physical organism is not aware of it. The subconscious does receive the information however, in some of these cases. In other cases the experience is simply not recorded in any way within the physical organism, but it is recorded to deeper layers of the self that are divorced to a large degree from any physical manipulations.</td><td>物质有机体对它一无所觉。然而，在某些情况下，潜意识的确接收到信息。在其他情况下，这个经验根本没有以任何方式记录在物质有机体之内，而是记录在更深层面的自己之中，这些很大程度脱离了任何的物质操纵。</td></tr><tr><td>(Once again the lassitude began to creep over me, while I looked about the room with sharp eyes. I had a little trouble focusing on my writing paper, but none looking away from the table. Jane's eyes were closed, her manner as usual.</td><td>(再一次，当我用锐利的双眼环顾房间的时候，疲惫开始蔓延全身。我有点难以聚焦在书写的纸上，但视线一离开桌子就什么问题都没有。珍的眼睛闭着，行为举止和往常一样。</td></tr><tr><td>(Shortly after this my familiar old thrilling sensation began to creep over me. I have not been aware of it much recently, although in the early sessions both Jane and I experienced such effects often. It is, briefly, a rich tingling or thrilling that is very pleasant. It can appear in any limb or part of the body; remain localized or sweep the whole organism. Deeper stages of this are what Jane has called ecstasy in her psychological time experiments.</td><td>(在这之后不久，我身上开始出现熟悉的震颤感。最近我不大有这种感觉，但是早期在上课时，珍和我经常体验到这样的效应。简单讲，这是一种深沉的刺痒或震颤的感觉，令人非常愉悦。它可能出现在身体的任何一只手脚或部位上，停留在局部或遍布整个有机体。这种现象更深的阶段就是，珍在她的心理时间所谓的狂喜。</td></tr><tr><td>(This time it began in both my feet and moved up my legs to my hips, then manifested itself in the back of my head. It did not interfere with my writing. It was not overwhelming by any means, yet most definite, and lasted in residue until next break. See Volume 1, page 172 for a description of my first experience with this sensation, which was at first frightening to me, and accompanied by visual internal data which was quite vivid. Seth went into the experience in detail in the 24th session, explaining how at times it represented my attempts to perceive him, and at other times my attempts to perceive other data outside the usual sense channels.)</td><td>(这一次，它从我的双脚开始，然后向上移到双腿，再到臀部，然后显现在我的后脑勺。它没有干扰我写字。它一点都不会令人难以招架，但是非常明确，而且残留的感觉一直持续到下一次休息为止。见第一册，有我第一次体验这种感觉的描述，起初我被它吓到了，而且随之而来的还有内在视觉资料，非常生动逼真。赛斯在第20节详谈了这个经验，解释说它有些时候代表我试图感知他，另外一些时候代表我试图在惯常的感应管道之外感知其他资料。)</td></tr><tr><td>This physically unrecorded material is available to the subconscious however, if the need for it arises. Before it can be used by the physical organism it must then be taken from the deeper layers of the self to the brain for interpretation, as if it were new sensual data received through the methods with which you are more familiar.</td><td>然而，在肉体上不留记录的这种资料却可以供潜意识利用，如果需要的话。在物质有机体可以利用它之前，必须先从自己的更深层面把它提取到大脑进行解读，就好像它是经由你比较熟悉的方法接收的新感官资料一样。</td></tr><tr><td>In the dream state you smell odors that are not in your room. The memory of the odors is imprinted and registered by the physical body as faithfully and realistically as any—quote—“real”—end of quote—odor is in the waking state.</td><td>在梦状态中，你闻到了不在你房间里的气味。气味的记忆是由肉体既忠实又合乎现实地铭印和记录下来，就像醒时状态中任何“真实的”气味一样。</td></tr><tr><td>The odor experience becomes a part of memory and can be recalled through hypnosis. Sometimes it will arise spontaneously, as any memory may. The odor is as legitimate to the physical organism as any odor smelled in the waking condition. This is fairly important.</td><td>气味的经验变成记忆的一部分，可以透过催眠唤回。有时它会自动发生，就像任何记忆一样。这种气味对于物质有机体来说，与醒时状况里闻到的任何气味一样真实。这一点相当重要。</td></tr><tr><td>It makes no difference basically, underlined, whether or not the sense data is real in your terms or not. If it is recorded and registered by the physical organism it becomes a part of, and an equal part of, memory. In the case of the odor smelled in a dream, the mind experiences, and then the experience is interpreted precisely as if the senses had been used to perceive it. It is then incorporated with other experience by the physical organism.</td><td>无论按照你们的说法，这种感应资料是否真实，基本上都没有差别。如果它被物质有机体记录下来也留下印象，那么它就变成记忆的一部分，而且是同等的一部分。在梦中闻到气味的情况下，心智先经验，然后解读这个经验，仿佛感官过去早已习惯感知它似的。接着物质有机体再把它并入其他经验之中。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take your break.</td><td>你可以休息一下了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:56. Jane was dissociated as usual. Her eyes had remained closed, her pace had been better, her voice average.</td><td>(9:56休息。珍像往常一样出离。她的眼睛一直闭着, 速度更好，声音普通。</td></tr><tr><td>(Again toward the end of the delivery I had felt the pleasant lethargy, coupled with the sharp vision as I looked about the room. I noticed nothing unusual at break once more. I described my feelings to Jane once more, and she then surprised me by saying that she had a subjective feeling while speaking that her features had changed.</td><td>(再一次接近传述的尾声，我又感觉到愉快的昏昏欲睡，加上我环顾房间的清晰视觉。我再次注意到休息时没有任何异常。我又向珍描述了我的感觉，然后她让我感到惊讶的是，她说在讲到她的五官发生变化时，她有一种主观的感觉。</td></tr><tr><td>(We wondered if Jane's feeling was due to suggestion. During the week she had been referring to the 68th session as she did some work on the book on the Seth material; these sessions have to do with the construction of physical matter by each individual. This particular session was witnessed by Bill Macdonnel, and during it he made two pen and ink drawings of an apparition he claimed to see in a doorway of our apartment. The effect lasted for about an hour; during this session Bill and I together saw a distinct change in Janec features. This occurred at a break, without warning, and lasted for at least a minute, so that we had time for observation.</td><td>(我们想知道珍的感觉是不是因为暗示的关系。这一周，她在写那本谈赛斯资料的书时，参阅了第48节；这些课和每个个体建构实物有关。比尔·麦唐纳见证了这一节，而且在上课时，他为一个他声称在我们的公寓门口看到的显灵画了两张钢笔素描。这个效应持续了大约一个小时；比尔和我在这一节一起看到珍的五官发生了明显的变化。毫无预警之下，这发生在一次休息时间里，持续至少1分钟，以至于我们有时间观察。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth told us at the time that the apparition was of him, and that Bill could see it but that Jane and I could not because we were too "fussy" about what we allowed ourselves to see. He said that in the future—time unspecified— we should be able to see his apparition at times, but by no means regularly.</td><td>(赛斯当时告诉我们, 幽灵是他，也说比尔看得到，但珍和我看不到，因为我们对于我们容许自己看到的东西太“挑剔”了。他说在未来——没有指明时间——我们有时候应该能够看到他的幽灵，但绝对不是经常。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill’s drawings of Seth show an extremely high cranium—according to Seth Bill's graphic translation of Bill’s feeling of high intelligence on Seth's part—and a pointed chin. While pointed the chin is not long. Jane said, this evening, that her subjective feeling was one of elongation of the chin, to a point. She also felt her head was down onto her shoulders, and this is another attribute of Bill’s drawings.</td><td>(比尔画的赛斯有着极高的头盖骨——据赛斯说，是比尔把他对赛斯的高智商感觉转译成绘画——以及尖下巴。下巴虽尖，但不长。珍说，今晚，她的主观感觉是下巴伸长。她也感觉她的头垂落在肩膀上，这在比尔的素描上是另一个特点。</td></tr><tr><td>(Note above that the apparition and the feature change in Jane are two distinct and separated effects, both occurring in the same session. The one was visible to me, the other was not. Again, this evening I saw no change in Janes features.</td><td>(请注意上文说的幽灵和珍的五官变化是两个截然不同而且各自分开的效应，只是发生在同一节当中。一个是我看得见的，另一个我看不见。再一次，今晚我看到珍的五官没有任何变化。</td></tr><tr><td>(It was now time for the 46th Dr. Instream experiment. Jane had smoked only at break. Her eyes were now closed, her hands raised to her face, her pace broken by many short pauses and a few long ones. Resume at 10:05.)</td><td>(现在是进行第46次殷斯翠姆博士实验的时候了。珍只在休息时抽过烟。她的双眼此时已经闭上，双手高举到她的面前，很多次短暂地停顿和几次长时间的停顿打断她的步调。在10:05分继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Give us a moment for our Instream material.</td><td>现在。给我们一点时间处理我们的殷斯翠姆资料。</td></tr><tr><td>He has received today a parcel bound in string, with string.</td><td>他今天收到了一个用绳子捆绑的包裹。</td></tr><tr><td>The object is made of glass. A tumbler, partially filled with water. A transparent tumbler, with a stem, and chalice-shaped.</td><td>这个物品是玻璃做的。一个玻璃杯，装了一部分的水。一个透明的玻璃杯，有着一个握柄以及圣杯的形状。</td></tr><tr><td>The package has to do with the initials M. Minnesota, I do not know except for the initial. The number four is also connected with the package. It was addressed on both sides, and cost 43 cents, I believe, to mail.</td><td>这个包裹与明尼苏达州的缩写M有关，除了缩写，其他我不知道。数字4也和包裹有关。两面都有地址，而且我相信，邮资是美金43分钱。</td></tr><tr><td>The address was in ink, and printed. A W also connected with the sender of the package. Perhaps something like Winnip, but I am only sure of the W. The number 16 after the city in which the sender lives. Perhaps a connection with some kind of cards, and a scoop, using the word as a news scoop</td><td>地址是用墨水印上去的。W这个字母也和包裹寄件人有关。也许是像威尼普(Winnip)之类的，但我只确定有W而已。在寄件人居住的城市名称后面是数字16。也许和某种纸牌，以及一则独家新闻，用这个字当作独家新闻有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Also a letter or note having to do with mileage. Perhaps in connection with a trip.</td><td>还有和里程数有关的一封信或便条。也许和一趟旅行有关。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have an envelope for me, Joseph?</td><td>约瑟，你有没有信封要给我？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes."</td><td>(“有。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused at 10:15.  Her eyes still closed, she reached out to take the envelope for our 39th experiment from me. She held it to her forehead for a few sentences, then lowered it to her lap.)</td><td>(珍在10:15停顿。她的眼睛仍然闭着，伸手从我这里拿了第39次实验用的信封。然后，她把它放在额头上，说子几句之后，接着再拿下来摆在大腿上。)</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment, please. These are impressions.</td><td>请给我们一点时间。这些都是印象。</td></tr><tr><td>A connection with the letter M, and with an occasion in which something was not appreciated. A connection with four here also. A rectangular shape, and a rather large X-shape mark.</td><td>与字母M有关，与一个有什么事不受重视的场合有关。这里也和4有关。一个长方形，还有一个相当大的X形记号。</td></tr><tr><td>(With the hand holding the envelope, Jane reached out to make a large vigorous crossing-out gesture, or X-shape, with her full arm. Her eyes remained closed.)</td><td>(手握着信封，珍伸出手，比了一个交叉的手势或X形，动作有力，两只手臂全开。她的眼睛一直闭着。)</td></tr><tr><td>This sort of thing, you see, in dark color, the X-shape mark in dark color, as something canceled.</td><td>你看，这种东西是深色的，X形记号是深色的，就像有什么被取消了。</td></tr><tr><td>Connection with an error. Connection with music, and with an ace. With something not known, and with 4 people. With a pole. Ruburt thinks of telephone pole, this leading him to a connection with a telephone pole.</td><td>和一个错误有关。和音乐有关，和一张王牌有关联。与某件未知的事，以及4个人有关。和一根杆子有关。鲁柏想到了电线杆，这把他引导到一个与电线杆有关的联结上。</td></tr><tr><td>A sun shape, or yellow in the upper right hand corner. Perhaps like rays.</td><td>太阳的形状，或右上角的黄色。也许就像光线一样。</td></tr><tr><td>The number 12, and perhaps 3 with this. December, I do not know.</td><td>数字12，也许这个是3。12月，我不知道。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have any questions?</td><td>你有任何问题吗？</td></tr><tr><td>( I have been trying out different kinds of questions. 7his was my third opportunity. The first time I had asked Seth for data on a category not mentioned, namely color. The second time I asked him to start over the whole thing. This time I tried something else.</td><td>(我一直在尝试各种各样的问题。这是我的第三次机会。第一次我向赛斯询问的事没有提到类别的资料，也就是颜色。第二次要求他从头开始。这次我试了别的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“How about elaborating on your reference to something that was not appreciated? ")</td><td>(“要不要详细说明你提到的某件不受重视的事情？”)</td></tr><tr><td>All I have is the feeling that something was not appreciated, and that an error might have been somehow responsible.</td><td>我有的只是，感觉有什么事不受重视，以及可能有一个错误造成了这个状况。</td></tr><tr><td>A Saturday here. It seems the letters D and C, and something to do with grace, and an appointment.</td><td>这里有一个星期六，似乎是字母D和C，还有与恩典有关的什么东西，以及一个预约。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:25. Jane was dissociated as usual. Her eyes had remained closed, her pace had gradually speeded up somewhat.</td><td>(10:25休息。珍像往常一样出离。她的眼睛一直闭着，速度逐渐加快一些。</td></tr><tr><td>(It seems to be the rule now that Jane has some visual data, whether faint or stronger, during the envelope experiments. She said she may have had such data in the earlier experiments, also, but hadn’t been quick enough to catch it. It is tricky. The point is, Jane explained, that such data often needs interpretation. Seth gives her the information visually; it is then up to a part of Jane to correctly interpret this. Jane believes that in the early experiments her failure to appreciate this, to interpret correctly, led to many errors in the material; that actually, through Seth, she had received the correct data to begin with, but needed the practice in fine discrimination to even be aware that the problem existed. And of course needs more. A case in point here is the X-shape data explained later.</td><td>(现在的习惯似乎是，在信封实验期间，珍有一些视觉资料，无论是微弱还是更强。她说她在早期的实验可能也有这样的资料，但速度不够快而抓不住。这种资料很棘手。珍解释说，重点是这些资料通常需要解读。赛斯给了她视觉上的信息；然后就由珍的某一部分来正确解读这个。珍相信在早期的实验中，她没有意识到这一点，没有正确解读，导致资料出现很多错误；实际上，透过赛斯，她一开始就接收到正确的资料，但需要明察秋毫，才能注意到有这个问题存在。当然除此之外，还需要更多。这里有一个很好的例子，就是稍后会解释的X形资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(See the tracing of the envelope object on page 1. As stated it is a membership card in the AAA, purchased by me on August 14,1964, and good for one year. It is printed entirely in dark blue ink on glossy white heavy paper. The exception is the large AAA seal affixed by hand beneath my typed address; this is in black, embossed on foil. The back of the card is covered by fine print, giving detailed instructions ’re the procedure after an accident, etc., calling Western Union, bail bond procedure, etc.</td><td>(见上面的物件描图。如前所述，它是一张AAA会员卡，是我在1964年8月14日购买的，有效期一年。它完全是用深蓝色墨水印在亮面的白色重磅纸上。例外的是，AAA封件是用手压印在我的地址下面；这是黑色的，浮雕在银箔上。卡片背面布满小号字体，详细说明事故发生后的处理程序，如西联汇款、保释程序等等。</td></tr><tr><td>(Strangely enough, some of tonight’s envelope data is corroborated by earlier session material—something I did not anticipate when using the card as object. The notes in the 81st session for August 28,1964, explain some connections made this evening. I was about to throw the card away this week when I thought of using it for the envelope tonight, and consciously had forgotten many of the 1964 connections.</td><td>(奇怪的是，今更早的上课资料证实了今晚的一些信封资料——在使用这张卡作为实验物件的时候，我并没有料到会这样。在1964年8月28日的第81节当中，解释了今晚所做的一些连结。本来我这个星期就要把卡扔掉了，正好想到今晚的信封用得上它，在意识上我已经忘记1964年的很多关联。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth did not go over each connection with us, but does agree with the ones Jane and I were able to make.</td><td>(赛斯并没有与我们一一讨论每一个关联，但确实同意珍和我所能想出的连结。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with the letter M”, referred, I thought, to the initials, MCI, which are used to designate the modern new office building here in Elmira, at which I bought my membership in the AAA. Later note by RFB: Signed by Merrill. Note on the object that the address of this new building was added later to the card, beneath the old address which was blocked out. This building was barely in operation at the time I joined AAA, in August 1964; the top floors were not yet finished.</td><td>(“与字母M的关联”，我认为，涉及MCI这个缩写，它被用来称呼埃尔迈拉这里所盖的现代办公大楼，也就是我购的AAA会员资格。罗·柏兹稍后的说明：由“Merrill”签署。注意在这个物件上，这栋新大楼的地址是后来才加在卡片上，在涂销的旧地址下面。我在1964年8月加入AAA的时候，这栋大楼才刚刚开始启用；上面的楼层尚未完工。</td></tr><tr><td>(“and with an occasion in which something was not appreciated.” This at once reminded me of a most definite event, involving Jane and me, that was not appreciated. It took place at the same time I purchased membership in AAA, and the locale of this unappreciated event was a gasoline station directly across the street from the MC I building. Our car was the subject, and this material is well covered in the notes in the 81st session for August 26,1964. See Volume 2.</td><td>(“与一个有什么事不受重视的场合有关。”这马上让我想起一个事件，涉及了珍和我，确确实实是不被赏识的。它就发生在我去AAA购买会员资格的同时，这个不受重视的事件发生地点是MCI大楼正对面的一个加油站。我们的车是主角，这份资料在1964年8月26日第81节的注释有详尽地描述。见第二册。</td></tr><tr><td>( I bought the membership in AAA on Friday, August 14,1964, at about I PM. We were both on vacation beginning that day, and were due to leave for York Beach, Maine, the next day, Saturday, August 15. Jane and I drove downtown Friday. Jane had a couple of hours work to finish at the art gallery where she then worked. I dropped her off there, then left the car at the station in question for an oil filter change and a general checkup. I went across the street to the MC I building, joined AAA, then walked home. I was due to return to the station for the car at 5 PM that same day. I would pick up Jane and we would be free.</td><td>(1964年8月14日星期五，我在下午1点左右买了AAA会员卡。我们两人那天都开始放假，正准备隔天，8月15日星期六，出发前往缅因州的约克海滩。星期五，珍和我开车到市中心。珍在她当时上班的画廊有一两个小时的工作要完成。我在那里让她下车，然后把车停在上述的加油站，更换机油滤清器也做做一般检查。我过马路到MCI大楼，加入了AAA，然后走路回家。我原本预定当天下午5点回加油站取车。我会去接珍，然后我们就没事了。</td></tr><tr><td>(When I walked back downtown to the station at 5 PM to pick up the car, I was dismayed to be told that the mechanic there was having much trouble replacing the oil filter cap, that it persisted in leaking no matter how much force he used trying to tighten it. I was afraid the threads on the cap would be stripped; if the part in question had to be replaced, it meant dismantling the steering gear on our particular make of car, and thus a delay starting our vacation until next week.</td><td>(当我在下午5点从市中心回到加油站取车时，我很沮丧，因为他们告诉我，技术在更换机油滤清器盖时遇到了很多麻烦，无论他多用力要把它拴紧，它还是持续漏油。我担心盖子上的网线会剥落；如果是上述部分必须更换，这表示我们这台特定车款的方向盘就得拆下来，这样的话，我们的假期就得延后到下周才能开始。</td></tr><tr><td>(Watching the mechanic struggle with the car, I felt sure he was not familiar enough with the work to know what he was doing. I made my feelings known, then left for the gallery to tell Jane. This was at a time when Seth was beginning to Jill us in on the power of expectation; Jane insisted that the car would be ready when we went back for it. We ate in a diner, and Jane concentrated on the car being ready. When we went back for it an hour later it was indeed ready. The station mechanic told us he was surprised that he had been able to fix it. The incident had upset me considerably, in a way that would not bother me now.</td><td>(看着技师与车子搏斗，我感觉很确定他不够熟悉这件事，所以不知道自己在做什么。我表达了我的感觉之后就离开，前往画廊告诉珍。当时赛斯正开始给我们的资料谈的是预期的力量；珍坚持说我们回去取车时，车子就修好了。我们在一家小餐馆吃饭，珍全神贯注在车子修好的预期上。当我们1小时后回去时，它真的修好了。加油站的技师告诉我们，他很惊讶自己居然能够修好它。这个事件曾经让我相当沮丧，但那种沮丧现在并不会困扰我。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with four here also.” We could not see any such connection, other than the number four appearing several times on the object.</td><td>(“这里也和4有关联。”除了数字4在物品上出现过几次之外，我们看不到任何这样的关联。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A rectangular shape”, The membership card is rectangular in shape, whether opened up as shown on page 1, or folded as indicated. It was folded in the usual double sealed envelope this evening.</td><td>(“长方形”，会员卡是长方形的，无论是像第一页显示的那样展开，还是如图所示折叠。今晚它是折叠放在双边贴合的信封里。</td></tr><tr><td>(“and a rather large X-shape mark. This sort of thing, you see, in dark color, the X-shape mark in dark color, as something canceled.” As mentioned on page 7, this is an instance where Jane received internal visual data from Seth, and had the responsibility of interpreting it correctly. Note that she feels her way through this data, finally arriving at something more specific in the last three words. On the membership card it is plainly printed that the coverage expires in 1965.</td><td>(“还有一个相当大的X形记号。你看，这种东西是深色的，X形记号是深色的，就像有什么被取消了。”如前所述，这是珍接收到赛斯内在视觉资料的实例，也负起正确解读它的责任。请注意，她凭感觉摸索这份资料，终于在最后三个字里得到比较具体的概念。会员卡上面明确印着有效期限到1965年。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane said that wddhen giving this bit of data she plainly had the feeling that the visual X-shape was to show her that something was canceled. The card expired in 1965. Jane also saw the large X on a rectangular card shape, within, but saw no detail on this card shape that would have enabled her to identify< the envelope object specifically.</td><td>(珍说，在给出这个资料时，她明显感觉到X形是为了向她展示有什么被取消了。这张卡在1965年到期。珍也在一张长方形卡片上看到大X，但是看不到这个卡片形状有任何能够让她明确辨别信封物件的细节。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with an error. "An error is prominent here. When I filled out my application for the insurance policy that went with the AAA membership, I inadvertently made a mistake in my license number. I did not discover this until I returned home, so when I went back downtown to pick up the car at the station, I dropped in at the MC I building to the AAA office. I was told the mistake did not matter.</td><td>(“与一个错误有关联。”错误在这里很突出。当我在填写AAA会员资格所需的保险申请表时，无意间在我的驾照号码上犯了一个错误。直到我回家才发现这件事，所以当我回市中心，去加油站取车时，我顺便去MCI大楼的AAA办公室。它们跟我说这个错不要紧。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with music", reminds me that I heard  music while in the AAA office; the music was piped throughout the new building by a public address system. Jane and I are well aware of this because a friend of ours worked in another office in the MC I building, and remarked often on this piped music, which she disliked but was forced to listen to all day on the job. In addition, the AAA office was below ground level and without windows, and my personal opinion was that the music was some kind of compensation for not being able to see daylight.</td><td>(“与音乐有关联”，让我想起当我在AAA办公室时，我听到了音乐; 那音乐是经由公共广播系统在整栋新大楼放送。珍和我很清楚这一点，因为我们的一个朋友在MCI大楼的另一间办公室工作，并且经常批评这种罐头音乐，她不喜欢但被迫在工作中听一整天。此外，AAA办公室在地下室一楼，没有窗户，我个人认为音乐是因为不见天日而做的某种补偿。</td></tr><tr><td>(“and with an ace. "Jane said this is a personal derivation of hers from the prominent black seal of the AAA, affixed to the bottom of the card, below my name, as described. Another interpretation of this seal follows later.</td><td>(“和一张王牌有关联。”珍说，这是她个人从AAA突出黑色封印所做的引申，如上所述，封印附在卡片底部，在我的名字下面。稍后有这个封印的另一种解读。</td></tr><tr><td>(“With something not known, and with 4people.”Jane and I have an idea as to a connection here, but since we cannot support it we decided not to list it.</td><td>(“与某件未知的事，以及4个人有关。”对于这里的一个关联，珍和我有一个想法，但是我们拿不出实据，所以我们决定不把它列出来。</td></tr><tr><td>(“With a pole. Ruburt thinks of telephone pole, this leading him to a connection with a telephone pole.” On the back of the envelope object shown on page 1, there are many references to using the telephone, in the detailed instructions given by the AAA as to procedures after involvement in an auto accident. Many of the instructions have to do with using the telephone, Western Union, etc., as indicated on the card itself.</td><td>(“和一根杆子有关联。鲁柏想到电线杆，导致他联想到电线杆。”见前面显示的信封物件背面，在AAA对于遭遇车辆之后的程序提供的详细指示当中，有很多使用电话的参考资料。如卡片本身所示，很多指示与使用电话、西联汇款等等有关。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A sun shape, or yellow in the upper right hand corner. Perhaps like rays.” See the bottom of page 9. Jane said this is another reference to the heavy, glossy, or shiny black AAA seal affixed to the membership card below my name. To her, the design of the three A's can represent the conventional lines of radiation around a circle, or sun, shape. She often used this symbolism in her own oil painting, thus:</td><td>(“太阳形状，或右上角的黄色。也许像光线一样。”见下图。珍说这是再一次提到附在我的会员卡上，我的名字下方，那个厚重、亮光或发亮的黑色AAA封印。对她来说，三个A的设计可以代表环绕一个圆圈形状或太阳形状的常见辐射线条。她经常在自己的油画中使用这种象征符号，例如：</td></tr><tr><td>(The yellow or sun references may come from the design of the letters A, but perhaps also from the shiny surface foil texture of the seal itself. It can be seen that if the object was held upside down while sealed in the double envelope, it would appear to the percipient to be in the upper right hand corner.</td><td>(黄色或太阳的关联可能来自字母A的设计，但也可能来自封印本身的亮面银箔质感。可以看出，如果是密封在双层信封里，倒着拿起这个物件，那在感知者看来，它就好像在右上角似的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The number 12, and perhaps 3 with this. December, I do not know. “My membership in AAA was good for twelve months, which could have led Seth to the December, or twelfth month, data, but we are not sure here. Nor do we come up with anything for the number 3.</td><td>(“数字12，也许是3和这个有关联。12月，我不知道。”我的AAA会员资格有效期是12个月，这可能是赛斯提出上述12月或12个月的导因，但这里我们不确定，我们也想不出任何与数字3有关的连结。</td></tr><tr><td>(“All I have is the feeling that something was not appreciated", followed my request for Seth's elaboration on this data. See the original interpretation on page 7.</td><td>(“我有的只是感觉有什么事不受重视”，这句话出现在我要求赛斯详细阐述这份资料之后。最初的解读见前面。</td></tr><tr><td>(“and that an error might have been somehow responsible.” My own idea is that the error here mentioned refers to my error in my license number, as explained on page 9. Seth also says “might have.” I think an error can enter into the car adventure, possibly, in that at the time I felt the mechanic servicing the car did not go about the job properly, and nearly delayed our leaving on vacation by several days as a result.</td><td>(“以及可能有一个错误造成了这个状况。”我自己的想法是，这里提到的错误是指前面解释过的，我的驾照号码错了。赛斯也说“可能有”。我认为一个错误可能会出现在这场汽车冒险之中，是因为当时我觉得维修这辆车的技师没有把工作做好，结果我们的假期差一点就延迟了几天。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A Saturday here.” It can now be seen that my question for elaboration on Seth's part did lead to a little more data. Saturday is involved with the envelope object, through our car. I obtained the actual object on Friday, August 14,1964; while doing this the car was left at the station for servicing, and the events developing at the station very nearly prevented our leaving on vacation the following day, Saturday, August 15. (“It seems the letters D and C", offered no connections to us.</td><td>(“这里有一个星期六。”现在可以看出，我要求赛斯详细说明而提出问题，确实带出了更多资料。星期六与信封物件有关系。我在1964年8月14日星期五取得实际物件；在做此事的同时，车留在加油站进行维修，而且在加油站发生的事件几乎让我们隔天，8月15日星期六无法出发去度假。(“似乎是字母D和C”，和我们没有任何关联。</td></tr><tr><td>(“and something to do with grace”, Jane burst out laughing when she made a connection here. At first we thought her idea did not apply, but then she felt it did, and Seth agrees. Note that on the AAA membership card the old address was blocked out. This was done with thin ink and we could read the old address, 382 W Church Street. Jane at once made the connection between church and grace.</td><td>(“还有和恩典有关的什么东西”，当珍在这里说出关联时，她笑了起来。最初我们以为她的想法不适用，但后来她又觉得适用，而且赛斯也赞同。请注意，在AAA会员卡上的旧地址被涂销了。这是用稀淡的墨水涂销的，我们还看得到旧地址，教堂西街382号[382W. Church]。珍立刻把教堂和恩典连结在一起。</td></tr><tr><td>(More, the new MC I building is but a couple of blocks from the old AAA location; the new address is on the corner of College Avenue and Church Street. And the Grace Episcopal Church is two blocks up Church Street.</td><td>(此外，新的MCI大楼离AAA旧址只有一两个街区；新址位于学院大道[College Avenue]与教堂街的拐角处。圣公会恩典教堂位于教堂街往前两个街区。</td></tr><tr><td>(“and an appointment. “As noted in the car data on pages 8 and 9, I had an appointment to pick up the car at the service station at 5 PM Friday, August 14,1964, the same day I bought membership in AAA.

Also gone was the neck pain that I had experienced before the session began. Jane did not know about this.</td><td>(在珍继续之前，我告诉她，这节稍早时我本来希望赛斯谈谈我的身体感受。它们现在几乎已经消失了。我只感觉到轻微但挥之不去的一种震颤效应，主要在我脑后；昏沉感不见了。我在这节开始之前体验的头部疼痛也消失了。珍不知道这件事。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed with her head resting on her crossed arms as they lay upon the table.

I did not begin using it until fifteen minutes before the session, and then began by eliminating categories in Mondays session until I found the one I was reacting to physically. This proved to be Mondays envelope experiments, and my fear, or concern, that perhaps I was pushing Jane on such matters.</td><td>(赛斯切中要点的速度比我用摆钟还要快，只不过我是因为时间不够而有点屈居下风。我一直到这节开始前15分钟才开始使用它，然后先是排除星期一那节的各个类别，直到我找到我在身体上有反应的一个为止。这被证明是星期一的信封实验，以及我觉得也许是我在这些事情上逼迫珍而产生的恐惧或担忧。</td></tr><tr><td>(The pendulum told me Jane did not feel this way, and after the session she agreed. Nevertheless the pendulum told me I felt some anger at myself on this score, hence the stiff neck. I had not reached any such neat conception as “a pain in the neck” before Jane called me.

As stated on page 2, she was aware of the irritation before the session, but puzzled as to its source. She did not know of my pain in the neck, or that I was using the pendulum.)</td><td>(摆钟告诉我，珍没有这种感觉，而且课后她也赞同。然而，摆钟告诉我，我因为这个成绩而对自己有些愤怒，因此头部僵硬。在珍叫我之前，我还没有接收到像“锥劲之痛”这样一清二楚的概念。珍此时说她在这节开始之前有非常强烈的烦躁感，那是因为她感应到我对我自己的烦躁。像前面所说的，她在这节开始前就觉察到这股烦躁，却不知它从何而来。她不晓得我的头部在痛，也不知道我在使用摆钟。)</td></tr><tr><td>(Tracing of the holly leaf used as the object in the 40th envelope experiment, in the 241st session for March 14,1966.)</td><td>在1966年3月14日第241节的第40次信封实验用作标的物的冬青叶描摹图</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 241</td><td>第241节 心理桥梁与联想 信封40</td></tr><tr><td>MARCH 14, 1966 9 PM MONDAY AS SCHEDULED</td><td>1966年3月14日 星期一 晚上9点 定期课</td></tr><tr><td>(The 40th envelope experiment was held during the session. See the tracing above. The envelope object was a dried holly leaf. This gray-brown leaf had been taped to the shade on my lamp at work for well over a year; originally I had used it as a model in doing some artwork for a Christmas card. I saved it because of its interesting color and shape, and the fact that its points were as sharp as ever. It was sealed in the usual double envelope, between two pieces of Bristol. Jane had never seen it, nor did she know I had brought it home.</td><td>(第40次信封实验在课间进行。见上面的描摹图。信封标的物是一片干燥的冬青叶。这片灰褐色的叶子贴在我办公室的台灯灯罩上有一年多了；最初我用它当模型为一张圣诞卡画些插图。我之所以保存它，是因为它的颜色和形状很有趣，而且它的尖刺始终锐利。它被密封在常见的双开信封里，夹在两片纸板之间。珍从未见过它，也不知道我把它带回家。</td></tr><tr><td>(Last night Peggy Gallagher told us that she is following the suggestions given by Seth in the unscheduled 238th session, but hasn’t noticed any improvement yet in the “bursitis" in her neck and left shoulder and arm.

It must also be formed by portions of my own essence, and by portions of Ruburt's personality. It can be thought of almost as a psychological protrusion, though this is not precisely the word to explain it.</td><td>这种心理架构显然一定是善于接纳的。它也一定是由我自己的部分元素和鲁柏的部分人格组成的。可以把这想成是几近于一种心理的突出物，尽管这并不是解释它的精确用词。</td></tr><tr><td>Bridge perhaps is better. This psychological framework is in itself capable of growth, in terms of development. It represents on Ruburt's part a psychological expansion, and indeed on my own part also. It is formed partially by abilities inherent within all personalities, psychic abilities, and it is composed of energy. It is not a secondary personality, for it exists in quite a different dimension than secondary personalities.</td><td>桥也许更好。就发展而言，这种心理架构本身具有成长的能力。它代表鲁柏那边，其实也是我自己这边的心理扩展。它一部分是由所有人格之内固有的能力，即心灵能力所形成，并且它是由能量组成的。它不是次要人格，因为它存在于一个截然不同于次要人格的维度。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. This psychological framework is the medium through which we can communicate. It is purely a psychic organization that telepathically transmits concepts from me to Ruburt. We have always preferred the light trance state over a deeper trance for several reasons.</td><td>现在。这种心理框架是我们能够透过它来沟通的媒介。它纯粹是一个心灵组织，透过心灵感应把概念从我这里传到鲁柏那里。由于几个原因，我们向来偏好轻度出神状态，胜过于更深度的出神。</td></tr><tr><td>I am interested mainly in education, and with Ruburts training by me through our present methods, the processes themselves are more clearly seen and understood. Some information comes to Ruburt fairly automatically, in that he speaks for me without having to consciously translate for me.</td><td>我主要的兴趣是教育，而且透过我们现有的方法由我来训练鲁柏，可以更清楚看到和了解过程本身。有些资料会相当自动地传给鲁柏，因为他是在不必有意识地帮我翻译的情况下为我代言。</td></tr><tr><td>At the same time, because of the methods we use, some translation is often necessary. In many cases this translation is done by the intervening psychological framework, which is simply the psychological point closest to the meeting of Ruburts personality and my own, for he does not fade out as a personality. He extends himself in an expansion. The psychological expansion on his end, and the psychological expansion on my end, form the gestalt, the psychological bridge, of which I have spoken.</td><td>同时，由于我们使用的方法，一些转译通常是必要的。在很多情况下，这种转译是通过中介心理架构来完成，这个架构只不过是最接近鲁柏的人格和我自己的人格交集的心理点，因为他身为一个人格是不会逐渐隐没的。他会在扩展中延伸自己。他那一端的心理扩展，以及我这一端的心理扩展，形成了我说过的完形，心理桥梁。</td></tr><tr><td>As he is learning it is, however, often up to him to interpret the images that I send him. The psychological bridge can transmit, you see, and to some extent translate, but not interpret.</td><td>然而，正如他所知，怎么解读我传送给他的意象往往是由他来决定。你看，心理桥梁可以传输，也可以在某种程度上翻译，但不能解读。</td></tr><tr><td>This psychological gestalt is a connector. I am dependent in a large measure upon Ruburts own knowledge, and lack of it, in that I cannot force for example from him, from his speech mechanism, concepts with which he is entirely unfamiliar. I must introduce them step by step.</td><td>这种心理完形是一个连接器。我在很大程度上依赖鲁柏自己的知识以及无知，因为，比如说，我不能从他的言语机制，强迫他说出他完全不熟悉的概念。我必须一步一步地介绍它们。</td></tr><tr><td>I could not have explained moment points to you, for example, until I had clearly given the idea of the spacious present. It is not as simple a thing as it might seem, for there is no coercion involved, Ruburt always consenting to let me push concepts at him, which he interprets speech-wise with my assistance.</td><td>例如，直到我清楚说明广阔的现在这个观念之前，我无法向你解释片刻点。这并不像它表面看起来那么简单，因为其中不涉及任何强制，所以鲁柏向来都是同意让我把概念塞给他，而他在我的协助下以说话的方式解读。</td></tr><tr><td>Often I give him an internal image, or experience, of a whole concept, but unless it could be vocalized it would have no meaning except to him.</td><td>我常常给他一整个概念的一个内在意象或经验，但除非它能够被说出来，否则除了对他以外，没有任何意义。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I suggest your first break.</td><td>现在，我建议你第一次休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:30.

Therefore in our experiments, often, I will give him an impression, and he will automatically translate it into visual terms, although his eyes are closed. And then he is tempted to interpret it literally, as he would an ordinary visual image.</td><td>鲁柏对感官印象当然比对内在资料，或不是经由肉体感官传送给他的印象更熟悉。因此，在我们的实验中，我经常会给他一个印象，而尽管他的眼睛闭着，他也会自动把它翻译成视觉用语。然后他会很想从字面上来解读它，就像他解读平常的视觉意象一样。</td></tr><tr><td>A beautiful example of this occurred in our last session, with the X image.</td><td>在我们的上一节，发生了一个很好的例子，用的是X意象。</td></tr><tr><td>(See page 7 of the 240th session for the envelope data on the AAA card used as the object. The card bears the expiration date, and Jane got at the idea of this by gesturing boldly with her arm, finishing up the several lines of data with “as something canceled.” See also page 9, where Jane describes the internal visual data accompanying her vocal data.)</td><td>(关于当作信封物件的AAA卡片资料，见第240节。卡片上有到期日，珍用手臂大胆地比出手势，试图说明这个物件的概念，以“就像有什么被取消了”结束了资料的几句话。另外见前面，珍描述了伴随她的声音资料而来的内在视觉资料。)</td></tr><tr><td>For simplicity’s sake, I say that I gave him the image, but actually I gave him the impression, which he translated into an image, so that he could deal with it in a more familiar way.</td><td>为了简单起见，我说我给了他意象，但其实我给他的是印象，他把它翻译成一个意象，这样他就可以用更熟悉的方式处理它。</td></tr><tr><td>As a result in such instances, it is up to him to interpret the image correctly. The words that you hear are my words and not Ruburt’s. However, they are representations of my thought, as they are sifted through various layers, first of all of our composite psychological framework, and then through layers of Ruburts own personality.</td><td>因此，在这种情况下，由他负责正确解读意象。你听到的话是我的话，而不是鲁柏的话。然而，它们代表我的思想，因为它们经过层层过滤，首先是我们的复合心理架构，然后再经过鲁柏自己的层层人格。</td></tr><tr><td>There is often at his end a final tug and pull, so that the vocal mechanism will finally speak the correct interpretation. Of course Ruburt’s own associations are used by me, with his consent, up to a certain point, to enable me to lead him to the proper subject or image.</td><td>在他那一端经常有最后拉扯，如此一来口语机制最终会说出正确的解读。当然，鲁柏自己的联想在他的同意下为我所用，直到某一点，让我能够引导他到正确的主题或意象上。</td></tr><tr><td>Then when we are successful there is a divergence from his associations so that he says the correct word, even though the correct word, for him personally, would be the wrong word as far as his personal associations are concerned.</td><td>然后，当我们成功的时候，就会从他的联想生一个分歧，好让他说出正确的字，即使对他个人而言，就他个人的联想来说，这个正确的字是错字。</td></tr><tr><td>This point is fairly important, for it shows how the personal associations are utilized up to a certain point, and then sometimes quite suddenly dispensed with, for they have served our purposes.</td><td>这一点非常重要，因为它显示个人联想如何被利用到某一点，然后有时突然被免除，因为它们已经达到了我们的目的。</td></tr><tr><td>On Ruburts part this can sometimes be disconcerting. We must always work with psychological organizations however. The emotions always follow associative lines in this regard.</td><td>在鲁柏那边，这有时可能令人不安。但是，我们必须始终与心理组织合作。在这方面，情绪向来都是跟着联想走。</td></tr><tr><td>The trick is to allow Ruburt’s associations free reign to a certain point, and then expertly insert the correct data. This is sometimes difficult. Ruburts associations may go for example from C, D, E, and F, but precisely where he would say G, we must insert X or Y, and do it so smoothly that he is quite unaware.</td><td>诀窍是，允许鲁柏的联想自由发挥到某一点，然后巧妙地插入正确资料。这有时很困难。鲁柏的联想可能来自，例如，C、D、E和F，但恰恰在他说G的地方，我们必须插入X或Y，而且做得非常流畅，以至于他不知不觉。</td></tr><tr><td>He consents for me, he consents to let me use his associations in such a manner. Nevertheless there is a small sense of alienation when the associations do not follow through, but are diverted to the desired end.</td><td>他同意我，他同意让我以这种方式利用他的联想。然而，当联想没有进行到底，而是转向想要的结果时，就会有小小的疏离感。</td></tr><tr><td>Here is a very brief example. Suppose I am trying to give him the impression of a glass of water. It is fairly easy to insert the idea of water, but this may lead him personally to think of the Gulf of Mexico, or the ocean off of Marathon, or even of the Atlantic at York Beach. I will use his associations until I am certain that he has the concept of the word water, but precisely where he is about to say the ocean for example, and after having made use of his associations to get him to this point, I must suddenly make him say a glass of water.</td><td>这是一个非常简短的例子。假设我试图给他一杯水的印象。插入水的概念相当容易，但这可能导致他个人想到墨西哥湾(Culf of Mexico)或马拉松(Marathon)外海，甚至是约克海滩的大西洋。我会利用他的联想，直到我确定他有“水”这个字的概念为止，但是正好就在他将说出，例如海洋，而且就在利用他的联想让他来到这一点之后，我必须突然让他说出一杯水。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I suggest your break.</td><td>现在我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:59.

Ezra had worked at my place of employment, Artistic Card Co., for many years.)</td><td>(“和某个深层东西有关联。地下的一个洞，像是矿坑或坟墓。”赛斯在这节稍早时一直在讨论信封资料的相关联想，我认为这份资料就是一个很好的例子。我的想法是，借由利用一个朋友伊若·海文[Ezra Havens]在1964年的死亡，这份资料提到了我的工作地点，我从那里取得这个物件。伊若曾在我的工作地点艺术卡公司工作过很多年。</td></tr><tr><td>(In Volume 5, see the 232nd session for Feb. 9,1966. In that session Ezra is dealt with in the envelope data with the same type of data; Seth gave Jane the grave data, signifying Ezra's death, but at that time Jane, who did not like the idea of graves, did not use the word. This time, Jane now said, she came out with it when Seth gave her the data. We believe the grave data was to refer to Ezra, who worked at Artistic before he died, and that this in turn was to lead Jane to identify Artistic as the source of the envelope object.</td><td>(在第五册，见1966年2月9日第232节。那一节，在有着相同类型资料的信封资料当中，也讨论过伊若；赛斯给珍坟墓的资料，表明伊若的死是有关联的，但当时珍不喜欢坟墓的想法，所以没有使用这个词。珍现在说，这次，当赛斯给她资料时，她把它带出来了。我们相信坟墓的资料是指伊若，他去世之前在艺术卡公司工作，而这又引导珍把艺术卡公司当成是信封物件的出处。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The number 6.

I have a habit of sticking various objects on the shade for easy reference—small pictures, drawings, pieces of tape, stickers of various kinds, and other objects.

Due to the long narrow shape of the lamp shade, the objects fastened thereon end up arranged in a row.</td><td>(“各种各样混在一起的形状排成一列。”我认为这是一个很好的关联，指的是冬青叶于工作地点的所在位置。我有一个戴乐牌台灯，一个标准的设备，固定在我上班时的绘图桌上。它是一个长约18英寸的日光灯。我习惯在灯罩上粘贴各种物品，方便参照——小图片、素描、一截截胶带、各式各样的贴纸，以及其他物品。其中一个最近才贴上的冬青叶；将近一年前，在我用完之后，就把它用胶带贴在那里。由于灯罩形状既长又窄，所以固定其上的物品最终排成一列。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A note from a man in connection with an achievement.” Jane said she believed she meant to say woman here instead of man, and that this data is another oblique reference to the connection of my boss with the source of the envelope object.

As I have told you in the past, the individual does indeed survive physical death, but there is a reorganization of psychological elements that compose the personality. The personality, even as you know it, is never static, always changing, and even the ego is not the same from one day to the next.</td><td>现在。以前我就告诉过你，个体确实在肉体死亡之后存活下来，但是构成人格的心理元素则重新组织过。即使是你所知的人格也绝非停滞不变，而是一直不停变动，甚至这一天和隔一天的自我也不尽相同。</td></tr><tr><td>The child’s ego is not the adult’s ego. As a rule you perceive the similarity, and overlook the differences of psychological patterns of this sort. The ego is not the most powerful or the most knowledgeable portion of the self. It is simply a well-specialized portion of the personality, well equipped to operate under certain circumstances.</td><td>孩童的自我不是成人的自我。通常，你会感知到相似之处，而忽略这种心理模式的差异。自我并非自己当中最强大或最有见识的部分。它只是人格当中一个相当专门化的部分，装备精良，可以在某些状况下运作。</td></tr><tr><td>When these circumstances no longer exist, then other layers of the self take over the dominant position, and the personality realigns its psychological components. The ego does not disappear, however. It merely takes a back seat in some respects, as your own subconscious does during physical existence.</td><td>当这些状况不再存在时，自己的其他层面接管支配位置，而人格则重新调整它的心理成分，然而，自我并没有消失。它只是在某些方面退居后座而已，就像你自己的潜意识在物质存在期间所做的那样。</td></tr><tr><td>When you sleep the ego becomes unfocused, but still present, and its goals and attitudes to some extent do color dream experiences. The survival personality has somewhat the same relationship to the ego as the dreaming personality has to it now.</td><td>当你睡觉时，自我变得没有焦点，但仍然存在，它的目标和态度会影响梦经验到某种程度。死后犹存的人格与自我的关系，和做梦人格现在与它的关系有几分相同。</td></tr><tr><td>It is a great mistake to imagine that the human being has but one ego, however. The ego represents merely any given pattern of characteristics, psychological characteristics, that happen to be dominant at any given time. If any kind of a thorough investigation were to be carried on, it would become apparent that during one lifetime any given individual will display several, sometimes quite different, egos at various times, each one quite honestly seeing itself as the permanent I.</td><td>然而，想像人类只有一个自我，这是一个很大的错误。自我仅仅代表任何在既定时间恰好居于支配位置的任何既定的特性模式、心理特性模式。如果进行任何形式的彻底调查，显然在一生中任何一个人都会在不同的时间展现几个，有时完全不同的自我，每一个自我都颇为诚实地把自己看成是永久的我。</td></tr><tr><td>A survival personality in many respects is psychologically much different from the individual that he was. The ego is now under the control of what may be loosely called the inner self. When communications take place between a survival personality and a personality who exists within the physical system, then this involves a reshuffling, again, on the part of the survival personality, where the ego is momentarily given greater reign.</td><td>在很多方面，一个死后犹存的人格在心理上与他曾经所是的个体大不相同。自我现在处于可以姑且称为内我的部分控制之下。当死后犹存的人格与存在物质系统之内的人格之间进行交流时，那这就涉及到死后犹存的人格这部分的重新洗牌，此时自我暂时被赋予更大的统治权。</td></tr><tr><td>There is the same sort of disorientation that the ego experiences within physical reality when an individual dreams. The same sort of psychological reshuffling occurs. If it did not occur, then in most cases communication would not be possible, simply because the survival personality would have such difficulty in impressing the personality who was still ego-oriented within the physical system.</td><td>当个体做梦时，自我在物质实相之内体验到同样的定向障碍。发生了同样的心理重组。如果它没有发生，那么在大多数情况下，沟通是不可能的，只因为死后犹存的人格很难给那些在物质系统之内仍然以自我为导向的人格留下深刻印象。</td></tr><tr><td>The survival personality for example relies mainly upon telepathic communication. The survival personality does not think in terms of words, but experiences concepts in a much more direct manner. This sort of thing simply could not be understood by the physically-oriented individual.</td><td>例如，死后犹存的人格主要依赖心电感应沟通。死后犹存的人格不是用语言来思考，而是以更为直接得多的方式体验概念。以身体为导向的个体根本无法了解这种事情。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth began talking about these points in the very early sessions. By the 15th session he was explaining Janes role as a translator for him, putting concepts into words, etc. See Volume 1.)</td><td>(赛斯在非常早期的课里就开始讨论这些问题。到了第15节，他解释珍身为他的翻译者这个角色、把概念形诸于文字等等。见第一册。)</td></tr><tr><td>The survival personality therefore momentarily inserts his ego in its old position. It can then interpret this data in terms that can be received and understood. This reassembly however does cause some disorientation on the part of the survival personality. The ego, back in its dominant position, finds the circumstances difficult to deal with. It is being asked to manipulate in a manner unfamiliar to it. The survival personality’s inner self gives this reassembled ego concepts in the same way that, often, the subconscious gives the ego concepts in physical existence.</td><td>因此，死后犹存的人格暂时把他的自我安插在它旧有的位置上。然后，它可以用能够被接收和了解的说法来解释这些资料。然而，这种重新组装确实会导致死后犹存的人格有些迷失方向。自我取回支配地位，发现状况难以应付。它被要求以一种它不熟悉的方式操纵。死后犹存人格的内我给这个重新组合的自我种种概念，就像潜意识在物质存在期间经常给自我种种概念一样。</td></tr><tr><td>This reassembled ego then attempts to perceive these concepts in terms of sense perceptions, which are sent as communications to the physical individual at the other end. Sometimes the communications are made directly, though they must be sifted through the subconscious of the physical individual. When the physical individual is trained along these lines however, he helps in this process, and a psychological framework, like a bridge, is erected that serves to connect the two personalities.</td><td>这个重新组合的自我接着试图根据感官知觉这些概念，把它们当成是通讯发送给另一端的物质个体。有时候通讯是直接进行的，尽管它们必须经过物质个体的潜意识筛选过。然而，当物质个体按照这些方式进行训练时，他就会帮助这个过程，并且建立像桥梁一样，用于连结两个人格的心理架构。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:31.

In sleep other areas of the self are being trained through their own kind of experience, and psychic organizations are built up, dispensed with, and built up again in a sort of practice maneuver.</td><td>在睡觉时，它不需要占主导地位，在死后犹存的状况下也不需要。在睡觉时，自己的其他部分正接受它们自身经验的训练，而且心灵组织也以一种练习操作的方式被建立、被摒弃、再建立。</td></tr><tr><td>These levels of the self have known self-consciousness in other existences, before the present one.

After this existence the ego will not remain dormant either. It simply will not be the dominant psychological entity that it is during physical existence.</td><td>因此，它们会与你分享物质生命，无论自我对此有无意识。在这一次的存在之后，自我也不会保持休眠。它完全不会是在物质存在期间居于支配地位的心理存有。</td></tr><tr><td>I am aware of the various egotistical selves that I have been.

If I had known either of you as contemporaries within your physical time in your present existence, then after death I would have assumed, once again, the dominant ego by which you had known me. I am not tied to physical existence by any strong emotional bonds however, and my personality structure is more advanced than is usual for communicators from other systems.</td><td>在我与你的通讯中，我是以全我的身分讲话，而不是在其他存在中居于主导地位的任何一个自我。如果我在你们现在这一世的物质时间之内认识同时代的你们其中一人，那么在死后我会再一次采用你们已经认识的这个主导自我。然而，我并没有被任何强烈的情感连结束缚在物质存在上，而且我的人格结构也比其他系统的传播者更为先进。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not need therefore to adopt a past ego. Perhaps because this is not necessary, the psychological bridge of which I have spoken is necessary in order to make my communications comprehensible to Ruburt.</td><td>因此，我不需要接受过去的自我。也许因为这不是必要的，我说过的心理桥梁是必要的，为的是让鲁柏能够理解我要传达的意思。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's pace had now slowed considerably.

On my end this framework projects imagery, and with my direction it uses Ruburt’s own personal associations to direct his impressions toward the correct point.

Peggy was given the out-of-town assignment one day earlier, Tuesday, March 15.</td><td>(这个周末我们与蓓核对过。正如赛斯说的，她没有出现；她计划在她工作的报社进行的活动出乎意料改变了；在第242节举行的周三晚上，她被带出城了。蓓说，下午接到任务，可能是下午3点左右；她不知道确切的时间。但是，赛斯或珍说的日子不正确。蓓是在前一天，3月15日星期二接到出差的任务。</td></tr><tr><td>(There was no disturbance at the newspaper through Wednesday of last week, Peggy said, but there was a most definite one, involving the manager and the city editor, on Thursday, March 17. This shook up the whole staff and resulted in a suspension. Since Seth was a day late regarding the change of plan, we wondered if he was a day early regarding the disturbance.</td><td>(蓓说，上周三一整天，报纸上没有任何骚动，但3月17日星期四很肯定有一个，牵涉到经理和财经版主编。这震惊了全体员工并且导致暂时停职。(由于就改变计划一事，赛斯说的日子晚了一天，所以我们怀疑他说的骚动时间是不是早了一天。</td></tr><tr><td>(At supper time this evening we were notified that once again Peggy could not appear tonight. Since we do not have a phone, she called a neighbor who relayed the information that Peggy could not come because "something urgent” had developed.</td><td>(今晚在晚餐时间，我们接到通知，今晚蓓又不会出现了。由于我们没有电话，她打电话给一个邻居转达讯息，因为发生了“某件急事”，蓓无法前来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Last Friday Jane received word that her article on the envelope experiments was rejected by Fate Magazine. In the 233rd session Seth said the article would sell, without naming the buyer, “providing Ruburt follows the way which has been set out for him. " See Volume 5, page 287.</td><td>(上周五，珍听到消息说，她谈信封实验的文章遭到《命运杂志》退稿。在第233节，赛斯说那篇文章将会卖出，但没有指明买方，“假如鲁柏照着已经为他铺好的路走”。见第五册。</td></tr><tr><td>(Since we wanted Seth to discuss this prediction, this gave us the idea of checking up on some other recent session material. I wrote up the notes on these and read them to Jane just before session time, thinking that if Seth didn’t cover all the points this evening, at least a beginning could be made.</td><td>(因为我们想要赛斯讨论这个预测，这让我们想到要查询最近一些课的资料。我为那几节写了详细的注解，并在上课前念给珍听，心想如果赛斯没有讲到今晚所有的要点，至少可以起个头。</td></tr><tr><td>(See the notes on page 269, Volume 5, of the 232nd session, dealing with Jane's recent poetry book and the request by Janes publisher, F. Fell, that she send it to him along with a tape of some of the poems, also by Jane. In the 277th session Seth said this book would be published. F. Fell returned the book a couple of weeks ago, and it is now in the hands of another publisher. Jane did not seriously expect Fell to accept this book, but still wants to hear from Seth about it. Playboy Press has also rejected the poetry book. See the notes on page 312, Volume 5. Seth hasn’t named any specific publishers in his predictions, nor have we asked.</td><td>(见第五册第232节的注释，提到珍最近的诗集以及珍的出版商费尔要求她把诗集连同一些诗的录音带一起寄给他。在第227节，赛斯说这本书会出版。一两周前，费尔归还了这本书，它此时在另一家出版商手里。珍并没有认真预期费尔会接受这本书，但仍然想听听看赛斯怎么说。花花公子出版社也拒绝了这本书。见第五册的注释。赛斯在预测中没有具体指明任何一家出版社，我们也没有问。</td></tr><tr><td>(In the 210th session for November 22,1965, Seth stated that he had picked up an “incipient malignancy” in Helen Dyer, who is a friend of our landlady, Marian Spaziani. See Volume 5, page 81. This data was given after the two women had visited us. We have heard nothing more on this, either from Seth or the two women. Last weekend Marians husband Jimmy told us that Marian herself must have an operation to remove a tumor on an ovary. Since Seth mentioned the abdominal region in connection with Helen, we wonder about possible distortion on Jane's part here. The material in the 210th session was focused strongly on Helen however.</td><td>(见1965年11月22日的第210节，赛斯说他在海伦•戴尔身上看到一个“早期恶性肿瘤”，她是我们房东太太玛丽安•史帕日尼的朋友，见第五册。这个资料是在这两个女人拜访过我们之后给的。无论是从赛斯或这两个女人那里，我们都没有听到更多这件事的消息。上周末玛丽安的丈夫吉米告诉我们，玛丽安本人必须动手术，除去卵巢上的一颗肿瘤。由于赛斯提到与海伦有关的腹部区域，所以我们怀疑这里珍的部分可能有扭曲。不管怎样，第210节的主要聚焦在海伦身上。</td></tr><tr><td>(In the 229th session Seth went into some detail concerning the tax problems of our landlord, Jimmy Spaziani. If Jimmy is having tax troubles we know nothing about it, and have heard no rumors. Since we have seen Jimmy a few times recently we wonder if Jane has picked up any telepathic information. Seth mentioned legal difficulties for Jimmy in connection with a March 15 date. Seth also saw a possible future illness for Jimmy.</td><td>(在第229节，赛斯详谈了我们的房东吉米•史帕日尼的税务问题。如果吉米遇到税务问题，我们对此一无所知，也没有听到任何会议。因为我们最近见过吉米几次，我们怀疑珍是不是接收到任何心灵感应的讯息。赛斯提到吉米在法律上的难题与3月15日那一天有关。赛斯也看到吉米未来可能罹患的一个疾病。</td></tr><tr><td>(In the 234th session, Seth dealt with predictions and free will. On page 293, Volume 5, he stated that he is hardly omnipotent—“Nor, strictly speaking, is such omnipotence possible.” See other recent sessions, on probabilities also. Jane and I wondered what part probabilities might have played in any of the above dates.</td><td>(在第234节，赛斯讨论了预测和自由意志。见第五册，他表示他算不上全能——“严格来说，这样的全能也是不可能的。”——其他谈可能性的部分，见最近的几节。珍和我想知道可能率在上述任何一个日期可能会扮演了什么角色。</td></tr><tr><td>( The session was held in our front room. Jane began speaking while sitting down and with her eyes closed. She was not smoking; her voice was average, her pace again slow, with many pauses.)</td><td>(这一节在我们前面的房间举行。珍坐下来，同时闭着眼睛开始说话。她没有抽烟；她的声音不急不徐，速度再次缓慢，停顿很多次。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. A few general remarks following our last discussion, concerning our sessions.</td><td>现在，在我们上次讨论之后，关于我们的课，有几个概略的看法。</td></tr><tr><td>A fine tuning of focus takes place here, where Ruburts abilities are focused in new directions, directions that are unfamiliar to the ego. A focusing is involved on my part also, and a kind of synthesis formed that allows us to bridge the gap that separates our fields of action.</td><td>这里发生了一个焦点的微调，鲁柏的能力聚焦在新的方向。自我不熟悉的方向。我的部门也有聚焦，形成了一种综合体，使我们能够衔接那个让我们的行动场域分开的差距。</td></tr><tr><td>The training involved on Ruburts part does result in a utilization of abilities, and for his conscious use. That is, the abilities are not being developed haphazardly, despite his own inclinations, but in answer to his inclinations. The personality therefore is being highly developed.</td><td>鲁柏那边所受的训练确实造成能力有其用的结果，而且是他有意识地使用它们。也就是说，尽管他有自己的倾向，但这些能力的发展并没有杂乱无章，而是响应了他的倾向。因此，人格正在高度发展中。</td></tr><tr><td>Now this development helps me, for I need his development in order that my communications be more clearly presented and received. Basically however all of this takes place in deeply unconscious layers. Abilities and energies are released. These cannot be willed however, on a conscious level.</td><td>现在这个发展对我有帮助，因为我需要他的发展才能更清楚呈现和接收我的讯息。然而，这一切基本上都发生在深层的无意识层面。能力和能量被释放了。不过在意识层面，这些是不可能由意志操控的。</td></tr><tr><td>Consciously Ruburt can learn to note various circumstances that seem to facilitate or inhibit his abilities, and our communications, but the abilities themselves develop in accordance with unconscious principles. I can take advantage of these principles, and to some extent use them, but I cannot ignore them.</td><td>意识上，鲁柏可以学会注意各种状况，那些状况似乎促进或抵制他的能力和我们的沟通，但能力本身是按照无意识的原则发展的。我可以利用这些原则，并且在某种程度上使用它们，但我不能忽视它们。</td></tr><tr><td>I am obviously also directed by my own unconscious, for there is always a principle that does not become conscious. This is a reserve, represents an overabundance, it is eternally inexpressible.</td><td>我显然也是受我自己的无意识指挥，因为总是会有一个原则不会变得有意识。这是一种储备，代表着一种过剩，永远无法表达。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. I am not going to discuss many of your points this evening. However, the poetry book will indeed sell.</td><td>现在。我今晚不打算讨论你的很多观点。不管怎样，诗集确实会卖出。</td></tr><tr><td>The material concerning your landlady’s friend was legitimate. The material concerning your landlord was legitimate. Probabilities are involved in this case, however.</td><td>和你房东太太的朋友有关的资料是合理的。和房东有关的资料是合理的。然而，这个案例涉及到可能率。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane now paused. Her eyes were still closed. She leaned forward in her rocker, elbows on knees, head down. The pause was rather long, and her voice was quieter when she resumed at 9:14.)</td><td>(珍此时停顿。她的眼睛仍然闭着。她在摇椅上往前倾，手肘放在膝盖上，头垂下来。停顿时间相当长，她在9:14分继续，更加轻声细语。)</td></tr><tr><td>(Give us a moment, please.</td><td>请给我们一点时间。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, let us go at our own pace here. These are impressions.</td><td>现在，让我们按照自己的步调前进，这些都是印象。</td></tr><tr><td>Four. The word Marguerite, I believe. A crisis involving health. A doctor. Initials R G. The words monosodium, and a long word that begins with a G or has the sound of a G.</td><td>4。我相信这个词是雏菊(Marguerite，译注：音译接近玛格丽特)这个词。一个涉及健康的危机。一名医生。缩写RG。“谷氨酸钠(monosodium味精)”这个词，还有G开头或有GR发音的一个长字。</td></tr><tr><td>Fight, perhaps eight o’clock, but I am not certain here.</td><td>8，也许是8点钟，但这里我不确定。</td></tr><tr><td>The second letter of the long word, or the third, is I believe an L. Perhaps there is a connection with eyes, e-y-e-s.</td><td>那个长字的第二个字母，或第三个字母，我相信是L。也许和眼睛e-y-e-s有关。</td></tr><tr><td>A connection with a man who can be considered an outsider to a group. He is connected with the crisis.</td><td>和一个男人有关联，那个人可以被视为一个群体的局外人。他与那个危机有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:21. Jane was well dissociated for a first break, she said. Her eyes had remained closed. Her pace had been slow at the end of the delivery. She was surprised at the early break, but more so at the impressions given, since she hadn’t expected them.</td><td>(9:21休息，珍说，在第一次休息时，她完全出离。她的眼睛一直闭着。在传述的尾声，她的速度缓慢。早早就休息让她感到惊奇，但更惊奇的是给出的印象，因为出乎她的意料。</td></tr><tr><td>(We did not know who they referred to particularly, but thought of the Gallaghers, since Peggy had canceled her date for tonight's session because of “something urgent.” Peggy's first name is Margaret, incidentally, rather than Marguerite.</td><td>(我们不知道它们特别指谁，但想到了加拉格一家，因为蓓由于“某件急事”取消了她参加今晚这一节的约定。顺便说一下，蓓的名字是“Margaret”，而不是“Marguerite”</td></tr><tr><td>( I thought the second of the two long words Seth had been groping toward might be glutamate, after the common food preservative monosodium glutamate. I thought that once I had read the chemical also had a medical use, but could not recall much here.</td><td>(我认为在赛斯一直搜寻的两个长字当中，第二个可能是在常见的食品防腐剂谷氨酸钠[味精]后面的这个词，谷氨酸盐[glutamate]。我想到曾经读过这种化学物质也有医学用途，但这里大部分都记不得了。</td></tr><tr><td>(As Jane sat resting during break, staring absently at the floor, she received the word “mine.” She doesn't know if this was from Seth or is a production of her own. In two recent envelope experiments Jane has used the word mine, or the underground image thus conjured up, to refer to a grave, meaning death.</td><td>(休息期间，当珍坐着歇会儿，心不在焉盯着地板时，她接收到“矿坑”这个词。她不知道这是来自赛斯，还是她自己的产物。在最近两次信封实验中，珍使用“矿坑”这个词，或因此浮现脑海的地下意象，指涉一个坟墓，意思是死亡。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane began speaking at a much faster pace. Her eyes opened as soon as she began, widely, and remained so for some little time. The rapid delivery was interspersed with short pauses. Resume at 9:30.)</td><td>(珍开始以加快很多的速度说话。从一开始她的眼睛睁大着，而且持续了一小段时间。快速的传述穿插着短暂地停顿。9:30继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. The physical body often and consistently acts upon subconscious knowledge, but in order to impress consciousness, such information must be carried by some kind of sense impression, whether this be a pseudo sense impression, or a more normal one.</td><td>现在。肉体经常始终如一地按照潜意识的知识行动，但是为了给意识留下深刻印象，这样的讯息必须经由某种感官印象传达，无论是假印象，还是比较正常的印象。</td></tr><tr><td>Some sense impressions fall beneath the threshold of consciousness, these impressions coming from the outside environment. Some impressions however have their origin within inner reality, and the personality is receiving information not available to the egotistical self. If such inner data is to become at all conscious, it must be translated into terms that the ego can recognize. In other words, into sense data.</td><td>有些感官印象没有通过意识的门槛，这些印象来自外在环境。然而，有些印象源于内在实相之内，而人格正在接收以自我中心的自己无法触及的讯息。如果这样的内在资料真的变得有意识，那它就必须被翻译成自我能够识别的用语。换句话说，翻译成感官资料。</td></tr><tr><td>Sense data therefore may be the result of perception of outer and inner environment. It is simpler to translate information from the outer environment into sense data. It is more difficult to translate inner data in this manner. There are frequent distortions but there are also frequent distortions in more ordinary sense perceptions. Inner data so translated must be built up from scratch, so to speak. There is in the physical world an illusion of continuity, against which sense data can be checked. There is no like sense of continuity, as a rule, against which to check sense perceptions which are translations of inner data.</td><td>因此，感官资料可能是外在与内在环境的感知结果。将讯息从外在环境转换为感官资料比较简单。以这种方式翻译内在资料比较困难。经常会有扭曲，但是在更平常的感官知觉里也经常出现扭曲。可以说，如此翻译而来的内部资料必须从头开始建立。在物质世界中，存在着连续的幻相，可以依据它来核对感官资料。通常，没有任何相似的连续感可以用来核对从内在翻译而来的感官知觉。</td></tr><tr><td>There is a significant similarity between sense perceptions that are translations of inner data, and the sense perceptions that take place in dreams, in that both are relatively fleeting. Both are highly symbolic. Both are methods of bringing deep knowledge closer to the realms of the egotistical self.</td><td>从内在资料翻译而来的感官知觉与梦中发生的感官知觉之间存在显著的相似性，因为两者相对来说都是瞬间即逝。两者都具有高度象征意义。两者都是使深层知识更接近以自我为中心的自己所属的界域。</td></tr><tr><td>Both involve culminations formed by various levels of the self, and yet are impressed into the physical organism. They must be registered by the physical self in one way or another, if the information is to become at all conscious.</td><td>两都涉及不同层次的自己所形成的结晶，但却被印刻在物质有机体之中。如果讯息真的变得有意识，那么肉体的自己就必须以某种方式留下它们的印象。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. In the earlier impressions that I gave you this evening, I was trying something new, and we will give you what further information we can, when we can. We were throwing our net of awareness in a large circle, so to speak, to see what we could catch, and the results should prove rather interesting.</td><td>现在。在我今晚稍早给你的印象当中，我在尝试新的东西，我们会尽可能在做得到的时候给你进一步的讯息。可以说，我们抛出一个形成大圆圈的觉知之网，看看我们能够捕捉到什么，事实应该会证明结果相当有趣。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a very brief break, and we shall continue.</td><td>我建议非常短暂地休息一下，我们再继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:48 Jane had again been well dissociated. She felt Seth rather strongly tonight, she said, and did not remember much of the material. Her eyes, after being open wide after break, closed and remained so for the rest of the delivery.</td><td>(9:48休息。珍再度完全出离。她说，今晚她强烈感觉到赛斯，而且大部分资料都不记得。她的眼睛在休息后睁得大大的，之后又闭上，传述过程的其余时间也都一直闭着。</td></tr><tr><td>(It was now time for the 49th Dr. Instream experiment, although as it developed this came a bit later than usual. Once again Jane spoke slowly, with her eyes closed and her voice rather quiet. Resume at 9:59.)</td><td>(现在是进行第49次殷斯翠姆博士实验的时候了，虽然实际上比平常晚了一点。再一次，珍闭着眼睛，慢慢说话，声音相当安静。9:59继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. The material that I gave you earlier, concerning your finances, was quite approximately correct.</td><td>现在。我之前给你的资料，关于你的财务状况，是相当接近正确的。</td></tr><tr><td>(We had asked Seth to comment on some of his material this evening but this question hadn't been included. See the 217th session in Volume 5.)</td><td>(我们要求赛斯今晚对他的一些资料发表评论，但这个问题并没有包括在内。见第五册第217节。)</td></tr><tr><td>The trip to New York should be made, and if made will be important to you. I advise you strongly to make the journey.</td><td>应该去纽约旅行，如果去成的话，对你会非常重要。我强烈建议你去旅行。</td></tr><tr><td>I believe there will be further changes at your own place of employment.</td><td>我相信你自己的工作地点会有进一步的变化。</td></tr><tr><td>(“What kind?")</td><td>(“什么样的变化？”)</td></tr><tr><td>Changes that may allow you to insist upon bettering your own position there. Now do not rush me.</td><td>那些变化可能容许你坚持改善自己在那里的位置。现在不要催我。</td></tr><tr><td>(Once again Jane bowed her head. She paused, her eyes closed. There have been changes at my place of employment, due to the retirement of management, the consolidation of some departments and the elimination of others, etc.)</td><td>(珍再次低下头。她停顿一下，闭着眼睛。由于管理阶层的退休、一些部门的合并以及其他部门的撤除等等原因，我的工作地点发生了变化。)</td></tr><tr><td>Changes that would involve, on your part, if you see the opportunity, not more time, but payment and recognition of responsibility that you already assume in the main. Some sort of a change involving your boss, I believe. Not one that will take him from the firm, but one which might take him further, in some way, from his immediate department, while he still remains connected with it.</td><td>如果你看到机会，在你的部分，变化会涉及到的不是更多时间，而是薪资以及对你基本上已经承担的责任予以认可。我相信，某种变化和你的老板有关。不是从公司把他带走，而是可能会以某种方式从他的直属部门把他带向前一步，同时他和该部门依然保持连结。</td></tr><tr><td>The situation can be used to your advantage if you recognize it. The initiation might be up to you. I am not clear on this.</td><td>如果你认识到这个情况，就可以利用它取得优势。会不会开始可能取决于你。这一点我不清楚。</td></tr><tr><td>(As far as I know, no such change is contemplated at Artistic Card Co. I have heard no talk or even rumors to this effect. Our department was recently moved but there has been no change in personnel. But as stated there have been many changes lately, and there could be more. My boss has held his present position for about fifteen years. Offhand I cannot think of how he could advance within the firm, unless he moved into the selling end of it. He is presently art director, and a member of the board.</td><td>(据我所知，艺术卡公司并没有考虑这样过这样的改变。我没有听到任何这方面的访谈甚至谣言。我们的部门最近搬动过，但人事方面没有变化。但是如上所述，最近有很多变化，可能会有更多。我的老板担任现职已经15年左右了。一时我也想不出他在公司内部要怎样晋塔尖，除非他转到销售部门。他目前是艺术总监，也是董事会成员。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane now took another pause, at 10:06.)</td><td>(10:06，珍此时再次停顿。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, give us a moment for our Instream material.</td><td>现在，给我们一点时间处理我们的殷斯翠姆资料。</td></tr><tr><td>I will give an object shortly-First, an impression of several small packages—many, I believe, all of the same size, coming to him or being sent from him through the mails. Perhaps they involve cards for scoring. Or a survey.</td><td>我很快就会给出一个物件。首先是几个小包裹的印象——我相信是很多个，全部都是相同大小，透过邮递寄来给他或是他寄出去的。也许他们和得分卡有关。或是一个调查。</td></tr><tr><td>I also have the impression of an object that looks like a toothbrush, but is used for cleaning something else. I do not know to what this refers.</td><td>我也有个印象是，一个看起来像牙刷的物品，但它是用来清洁别的东西。我不知道这是指什么。</td></tr><tr><td>Another separate connection, or separate impression, with a celebration of some kind.</td><td>另一个单独的连结，或单独的印象，与某种庆祝活动有关。</td></tr><tr><td>Now for the object. A book, or an object resembling one. It could be a box of book shape. The space between either the covers of the book or the covers of the box being colored, and patterned. (Long pause.) The patterns resembling imperfect circles—shapes—perhaps red, orange or yellow, but more than one color.</td><td>现在来讲物件。书，或类似书的一个物件。它可能是一个形状像书的盒子。书的封面或盒盖之间的空间上了色，也印了图案。(长时间停顿)图案类似不完整的圆形——可能是红色、橘色或黄色，但不只一个颜色。</td></tr><tr><td>The top of the book or box a shade of brown. Brown, yellow, or deeper—that is, darker. Perhaps a clasp on the side, to keep it shut. (Pause at 10:12.)</td><td>书或盒子的上面有褐色的阴影。褐色、黄色或更深——也就是说，更暗的颜色。也许是侧面的纽扣，用来关上它。(停顿10:12)</td></tr><tr><td>These are impressions. He writes in the margin. A purple fabric, nubby, with a resemblance to upholstery fabric.</td><td>这些都是印象。他在边缘写字。一块紫色布料、表面有桔子花，类似家饰布。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have an envelope for me?</td><td>你有信封给我吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes. "</td><td>(“有。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused at 10:14. Without opening her eyes she took the envelope for the 42nd experiment from me. She pressed the envelope to her forehead briefly, then lowered it to her lap.)</td><td>(10:14停顿。她没有睁开眼睛，从我这里拿了第42次实验的信封。她用信封在她的额头按压了一下，然后把它放到大腿上。)</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment, please. These are impressions.</td><td>请给我们一点时间。这些都是印象。</td></tr><tr><td>Nine. A miscellany of shapes. A connection with a light or a round bright object that suggests light.</td><td>9。各种各样混在一起的形状。与一道光或一个暗示光的圆形发亮物体有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>A motor. A forgotten item. Something spilled. Copy in the center of the bottom of a paper item. Elmira, NY, connected with this copy.</td><td>马达。一个被遗忘的物品。有东西溢出来。在纸质物品底部正中央的副本。纽约州埃尔迈拉与这个副本有关。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt for his own reasons connects this with the announcement of your nieces marriage. I mention this for your edification. His connection also here—keep this separately from mine—is of the old house used by the Christian Science church.</td><td>出于他自己的原因，鲁柏把它和你侄女的婚礼宣告连在一起。我提到这个是为了启发你。这里他的连结还有——把这个跟我的分开——基督科学教会(Christian Science church)使用的老房子。</td></tr><tr><td>A door which is dark, or opens into darkness. Twelve. A river or water connection. Perhaps this is no more than Water Street. I do not know here, so check it.</td><td>一扇黑暗或通向黑暗的门。12。一条河流或水的关联。也许这只不过就是沃特街(Water Street)(译注：珍和罗的依据就在西沃特街)。这里我不知道，所以去核对一下。</td></tr><tr><td>Circular shapes. Perhaps four heads.</td><td>圆形。也许是4颗头。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have any questions?</td><td>你有什么问题吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(This is my sixth opportunity to question Seth concerning envelope data.</td><td>(这是我第6次问赛斯信封资料的机会。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Will you elaborate on the four heads data?)</td><td>(“你能不能详细说明4颗头的资料？)</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment. Four heads came from the impression of circle shapes. Here interpreted as being connected with four people. Perhaps at a table.</td><td>给我们一点时间。4颗头来自于圆形的印象。这里被解释成，和4个人有关联。也许在一张桌子旁边。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused once more, and seemed to wait expectantly. This was my first shot at a second question during an experiment. We hadn’t discussed the possibility of more than one question yet, but evidently Seth—or Jane— is getting used to the idea of envelope questions so rapidly that soon questions may be asked at leisure.</td><td>(珍再次停顿，似乎带着预期等着。这是我在实验中第一次提出第二个问题。我们还没有讨论过多问几个问题的可能性，但显然赛斯——或珍——很快就习惯信封相关问题，因此没多久可能有空就可以慢慢发问了。</td></tr><tr><td>(To date I have picked general questions. I do not believe they are leading ones, and usually they bring forth more data.</td><td>(到目前为止，我挑的都是一般性的问题。我不相信它们是主要的问题，通常它们会带来更多资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Do you want to say something about the color of the object, if any”.)</td><td>("你想不想要谈谈物件的颜色，如果有的话？"。)</td></tr><tr><td>White, it seems, with a large oval darker shape. A date connected with it. Black, rather clear lines, one on the top, bottom, and two sides. Vertical. That is, vertical lines, on the top and bottom, and horizontal on the sides.</td><td>看起来是白色，有一个颜色比较大的椭圆形。一个与它有关的日期。黑色，相当清晰的线条，上方、底部和两侧各一条。垂直。也就是说，垂直线在上方和底部，水平线在两侧。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane gestured rather strongly with the envelope while giving this data. Her eyes remained closed.)</td><td>(珍一边给出这些资料，一边拿着信封相当有力地比着手势。她的眼睛一直闭着。)</td></tr><tr><td>A white border, with uneven edges, or slightly scrolled edges.</td><td>白色镶边，有着不平整的边缘，或微捲的边缘。</td></tr><tr><td>(Once more Jane paused, sitting quietly with her eyes closed. I waited a moment to see if she would resume.)</td><td>(珍再次停顿，闭着眼睛静静地坐着。我等了一会儿，看看她会不会继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>If you have a question you may ask it. Otherwise we may take a break.</td><td>如果你有问题, 可以发问。不然我们可能要休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(“How about more on the motor reference?")</td><td>(“可以谈谈马达的关联吗？”)</td></tr><tr><td>Something beats like a motor. I suggest your break.</td><td>像马达一样振动的东西。我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:25. Once again Jane said she was well dissociated; she didn't recall much of what she had said. Her eyes had remained closed since last break, and her pace had been fair.</td><td>(10:25休息。珍再次说她完全出离；她不大记得她说过的话。自从上次休息以来，她的眼睛一直闭着，她的速度尚可。</td></tr><tr><td>(See the tracing of the envelope object on page 29. As stated, it is the insurance receipt for the tape of the 170th session, made on July 19,1965 at the home of the Gallaghers, with them as witnesses.

It was rectangular and of the approximate proportion of the object. She was aware of black lines upon it. She saw it standing on a narrow end. This is quite possible, since I noticed during the experiment that she held the sealed envelope at various angles. Remember also that she gave white in connection with the object's color, in answer to my second question. The receipt is green.</td><td>(收据是长方形的；关于这个形状，珍说，她有一个内在的形象，白色的颜色。它是长方形的，而且是物体的近似比例。她知道上面有黑线。她看见它立在狭窄的一端。这是很有可能的，因为我在实验中注意到，她用不同的角度拿着密封的信封。请记住，在回答我的第二个问题时，她给出了与物体颜色有关的白色。收据是绿色的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane and I made quite a few connections ourselves, and did not ask Seth for more since he went into other material.</td><td>(珍和我自己做了很多连结，因为赛斯讨论起其他资料，所以我没有再向他多问。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Nine.

Vertical, that is, vertical lines, on the top and bottom, and horizontal on the sides.” The insurance receipt contains clear black printed lines, both horizontal and vertical on the front, and horizontal only on the back. As stated, Jane changed the position of the envelope frequently while she was giving the data. Thus lines that were vertical at one time would become horizontal, and it seems this would apply whether in relation to her as the clairvoyant observer, or the floor or whatever.

He agreed with my suggestion that we try the first session after the first of each month. We haven’t been this faithful but have decided to make stronger efforts here. There will thus be more deletions in the future. None of this evenings material is cut. I regard it as illuminating and a good example of the way Seth presents such material. On but two or three occasions in the past we have eliminated personal material from these records. This material is on file and available to anyone studying these sessions.</td><td>(在1966年2月9日的第232节，赛斯建议每个月利用一节课的一部分时间，来谈我们的心灵和身体状况。他同意我的建议，我们会在每个月第一天之后的第一节试试看。这里我们并没有那么一丝不苟，但是决定要付出更大的努力。因此，未来会有更多删除的资料。今晚的资料全部都没有剪辑。我认为它具有启发性，也是赛斯如何呈现这种资料的一个好例子。以前我们只从记录中删除过两三次私人资料。这种资料有存档，可供研究这些课程的任何人使用。</td></tr><tr><td>(The personal material we have received in the sessions has been psychologically sound. Jane and I feel this way because whenever we have put Seth’s suggestions to the test through practice, the results have been excellent.)</td><td>(我们在课间接收到的私人资料在心理方面是确实可靠的。珍和我都有这种感觉，因为每当我们透过实践测试赛斯的建议时，结果都非常好。)</td></tr><tr><td>You are now out of the woods, physically speaking. You have passed the period where in the past illness was most probable.

The results have been very good.)</td><td>(上周日，1966年3月20日，珍和我去宾州塞尔市我父母的家中探望他们。我们相处愉快。按照赛斯最近的建议——他通常是在临时课给出这类建议——我一直有意识地努力改进我对我父母的反应。结果非常好。)</td></tr><tr><td>I did not tell you this earlier since I did not want negative suggestion to operate. If you maintained good health up to and including March 20 of this year, you were in the clear, and so you are.

The subconscious bargain was this: For relative freedom the rest of the year, you settled for a virus that would hit you any time between January and March 20. March 21st, you see, meant spring to you, and because of your peculiar makeup the illness would only be permitted to attack during winter, or your conception of winter.</td><td>由于我过去已经告诉过你的所有原因，你心烦意乱。潜意识的讨价还价是这样的：为了在一年中剩下的时间里拥有相对的自由，你勉强接受一种会在1月到3月20日之前任何时间点攻击你的病毒。3月21日，你看，对你来说意味着春天，而且由于你的特殊体质，这种疾病只获准在冬天或你认为的冬天发动攻击。</td></tr><tr><td>(Last year I fell ill on March 24,1965.

Now there was a connection here with a vaccine, I believe taken by you and Ruburt, that should not have affected you at all.</td><td>现在有一些曾经服用过的药丸，我相信曾经在既定的时段内再次被活化。你的病毒就是这样的行为方式，你自己触发了它。现在这里有一个与疫苗相关的连结，我相信你和鲁柏施打了，但它应该对你根本没有影响。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Do you mean the polio vaccine?”)</td><td>(“你是说小儿麻痹疫苗吗？)</td></tr><tr><td>I do.</td><td>对。</td></tr><tr><td>(Cards given to Jane and me at the time show that we received Type I Sabin oral polio vaccine in October 1962, and Type I I in November 1962.

In any event Jane and I never did receive Type III.)</td><td>(当时给了珍和我的记录卡显示，我们在1962年10月服用了第一型沙宝口服小儿麻痹疫苗，并且在1963年11月服用了第二型。记录卡包含一条通知，内容大意是1963年春天就可服用第三型，但如果没记错的话，第三型在这个地区从来不曾免费开放给公众服用。无论如何，珍和我从未服用过第三型。)</td></tr><tr><td>You activated it yourself and I would not tell you this until you had completely conquered it. Ordinarily it would not have been dangerous at all, and it was not dangerous to Ruburt.</td><td>你自己活化它的，要不是你已经完全征服它了，否则我不会告诉你。通常它根本不会有危险，对鲁柏来说也不危险。</td></tr><tr><td>(While speaking, Jane opened her eyes and then got up briefly to get a cigarette from a nearby stand. She had been quite restless in her chair.)</td><td>(说话的时候，珍张开眼睛，然后短暂起身，从附近的一个架子上拿了一支烟。她在椅子上相当坐立难安。)</td></tr><tr><td>A negative suggestion given you by your mother allowed you to activate it. However, you would have found ways of your own in any case. And even though you activated it, you fought it.</td><td>你母亲给你的负面暗示允许你活化它。但是，你无论如何都会找到你自己的方法。即使你活化了它，还是会跟它搏斗。</td></tr><tr><td>(Strange as it may seem—or perhaps not so strangely after all—I remember my mother giving me this negative suggestion quite clearly. There had been a good deal of radio and newspaper publicity concerning the oral vaccines at that time. When we happened to mention to my parents that we had taken it, my mother was rather emphatic in emphasizing the dangers in taking “such things; you might get polio” etc.</td><td>(看起来可能很奇怪——又或许并不是那么奇怪——我母亲给我这个负面暗示的情形，我记得相当清楚。当时有很多关于口服疫苗的广播和报纸宣传。当时我们刚好向我的父母提到我们已经服用了，我的母亲用相当着重的口吻强调说，服用“这样的东西”很危险：“你可能得小儿麻痹”等等。</td></tr><tr><td>(Remember that this episode took place just before, or just as, these sessions began. At the time Jane and I knew little about the power of suggestion. We received Type I I in November 1963, the month in which we began experimenting with matters psychic. We did not get to work, really, with the Ouija board until later in the month; Seth made his appearance in December 1963.</td><td>(别忘了，这件事就发生在这些课开始之前或刚开始的时候。当时珍和我对暗示的力量知之甚少。我们在1963年11月服用第二型疫苗，那个月我们开始做通灵实验。直到那个月晚些时候，我们才真正开始使用灵应盘；赛斯则在1963年12月登场。</td></tr><tr><td>(As stated I fell ill with the virus in March 1965. I was also troubled by a virus in 1964, sometime between January and March; I was not in the habit of noting such things in the sessions then, so have no accurate record. I remember that I was sick three times that winter, each time to a lesser degree. The first two episodes cost me work time of several days each. I do not remember having any thoughts, at any time, connecting my illnesses to the polio vaccines.)</td><td>(如前所述，我于1965年3月感染病毒而病倒。在1964年1月到3月之间的某个时间，我也因为病毒感染而有状况；我不习惯在课间注记这些事情，所以没有准确的记录。我记得那个冬天我病了3次，病情一次比一次轻微。前两次生病都让我有几天无法工作。我不记得在任何时候有过把我的病和小儿麻痹疫苗连结在一起的想法。)</td></tr><tr><td>It represented, the illness, the last of a rather long-term and somewhat exaggerated distaste for your position in the world financially, that began when you left the field of comics.</td><td>这个病它代表的是，对于你在世界上就财务而言的地位，你最后一丝历时颇长而且略为夸大的厌恶，这种感觉始于你离开漫画领域那时候。</td></tr><tr><td>You struck out at yourself because in the past you found pleasure in doing something, and you were well paid to do it. Then you turned to something, painting, for which you were not well paid. You were caught between two reactions. One, resentment against the world in general, hence you listened to the news and picked out purposely the most blatant of your fellow mans’ transgressions, deriving from them perverse pleasure.</td><td>你猛烈攻击你自己，因为在过去你从做某个事当中找到乐趣，而且你做这件事得到的报酬也很高。然后你改做别的事，画画，得到的报酬并不高。你卡在两个反应之间。一个是对整个世界的怨恨，因此你收听新闻，故意挑选出你们人类同胞最露骨的违法犯罪行为，从中获得有悖常理的乐趣。</td></tr><tr><td>(This I well remember doing. Seth goes into the situation in some detail in the 143rd session.)</td><td>(我很清楚记得有做这件事。赛斯在第143节颇为详细地讨论了这个情况。)</td></tr><tr><td>The other was to hurt yourself. Now, it has taken you this much time to recover completely, and without our sessions recovery would have been slower. Now, your energy can indeed bubble up freely in your work.</td><td>另一个是伤害你自己。现在，它已经花了你这么多时间才完全复元，而且要是没有我们的课，复元速度会更慢。你的能量确实可以在你的工作中自由自在涌现。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take a break, or end the session.</td><td>你可以休息一下，或结束这一节。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 11:04. Jane was well dissociated, she said. Her pace had become fairly good, her eyes opening often. I left the well-paying field of comics just about at the time I met Jane, in the spring of 1954. Jane now resumed in the same manner at 11:06.)</td><td>(11:04休息。珍完全出离，她说。她的速度变得相当好，她的眼睛经常睁开。我差不多是在1954年春天认识珍的时候，离开了那个收入很高的漫画领域。11:06分，珍现在以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will end our session.</td><td>我们将结束我们的课。</td></tr><tr><td>I wanted to congratulate you however, you personally, Joseph.

Sometimes she has seen them but a few days before, sometimes months or years before. Whatever the case may be, it apparently makes no difference in the results as far as time goes, or previous visual contact. Seth does respond to emotional charges; these charges we have learned need not stem from Jane or myself or a fiend; they can be related to a total stranger and still be detected. Someday perhaps these envelope experiments can be correlated with various factors, sensual and otherwise. For some time now we have kept a weather record, taken just before session time, and there are probably correlations here. This record includes time, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall to date, wind velocity and wind direction. Soon I will make a copy of the chart to include with these sessions.</td><td>(有时候珍看过信封物件，有时候她没看过。有时候她看到它们，不过是在几天前，有时候是在几个月或几年前。无论情况如何，就时间或之前的视觉接触而言，结果显然没有任何影响。赛斯确实回应了情感电荷；我们学到，这些电荷不一定来自于珍、我或我的朋友；它们可能与一个完全陌生的人有关，但仍然会被侦测到。有一天，也许可以把这些信封实验和各种感官或其他因素连结在一起。我们在上课前记录天气状况已经有一段时间了，这里可能存在相关性。这份记录包括时间、温度、湿度、气压、迄今为止的降雨量、风速和风向。不久我就会复制一张图表，把这些课纳入其中。</td></tr><tr><td>(There may also be correlations via dreams but we haven't made any effort to study this, nor has Seth been asked.</td><td>(经由梦也可能发现关联，但我们没有下功夫研究这一点，也没有问过赛斯。</td></tr><tr><td>(The approach was a little different this evening, in that Jane had seen the envelope object perhaps two hours before the session. She helped me compile it for future checking against page 43. At this time I had no idea of using it for the experiment; the idea occurred later, some time after Jane had left the studio. I sealed it up in the usual double envelope, between two pieces of Bristol.</td><td>(今晚的方法有点不同，因为珍在这一节开始之前两个小时看到了信封物件。她帮我编纂它，以便未来依据上面的资料进行核对。这时我完全不知道会用它来做实验；这个想法是后来才有的，也就是珍离开工作室一段时间之后。我把它密封在双开信封里，夹在两块纸板之间。</td></tr><tr><td>(Bill and Peggy Gallagher were due to witness the session. Peggy was going to take flash pictures of Jane while she was in trance; Jane's publisher had asked to see some material of this kind.

He said that I might speak about dream locations, since he has been working on this subject for his own book.</td><td>事实上，鲁柏在我们的课之前说的没错。他说我可能会谈到梦地点，因为他一直在为他自己的书研究这个主题。</td></tr><tr><td>He wants to know in what dimension dream locations have their reality, and indeed he has considered all of the possibilities save the correct one. The correct one is the most simple one.</td><td>他想知道梦地点在什么维度有它们的实相，事实上除了正确的那一个之外，他已经考虑过所有的可能性。正确的那一个就是最简单的那一个。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. He has taken it for granted that dream locations do not exist within physical space.</td><td>现在。他理所当然地认为梦地点不存在于物质空间之内。</td></tr><tr><td>(Peggy now took her first picture. The flash startled me more than it did Jane, for she continued on, unperturbed.)</td><td>(蓓这时拍了她的第一张照片。闪光灯吓到我，却没有惊动珍，因为她继续传述，不受干扰。)</td></tr><tr><td>Dream locations exist in so-called physical space as truly, or as falsely, as physical objects exist in physical space. As you should know by now, physical objects are only the results of your own perception, and this perception is based upon your psychological makeup, your physical structure, certain combinations of nerves and chemical reactions. As any physicist will tell you, you perceive objects, and you perceive solid objects—</td><td>梦地点存在于所谓的物质空间，就像实质物体真实地或虚假地存在于物质空间一样。你现在应该知道，实质物体只是你自己的感知结果，而这种感知是奠基在你的心理构造、你的身体结构、某些神经和化学反应的组合之上。就像任何物理学家会告诉你的那样，你感知物体，你也感觉到物体——</td></tr><tr><td>(Peggy took her next picture, and once again Jane did not pause. Her eyes remained closed as before.)</td><td>(蓓拍了下一张照片，再一次珍并没有停顿。她的眼睛和以前一样闭着。)</td></tr><tr><td>—in a dimension where neither solidity nor objects exist. You perceive certain patterns of energy as solid objects, and that energy which you do not perceive as solid, you call space.</td><td>——在个体和物体都不存在的维度。你感知化为固态物体的某些能量模式，而你认为不是固态的那股能量，你称之为空间。</td></tr><tr><td>Because of other procedures which I have explained, including hiding the existence of constant telepathy, there is some agreement as to the placement of these objects, or if Ruburt prefers, locations, in space. Now this gives rise to what you may call mass-perception, with a hyphen between the two words.</td><td>因为我已经解释过的其他程序，包括持续心电感应的存在，所以关于这些物体在空间中的定位，或者如果鲁柏更喜欢的话，就说地点，是存在某种协议的。现在这引发了你可以称之为质量－感知(mass-perception)的东西，两个词之间使用连字符。</td></tr><tr><td>When you are dealing with dream locations you are not dealing with mass-perceptions, but with personal perceptions. There is no need therefore for any complicated arrangements calculated to insure agreement between persons as to location in space.</td><td>当你和梦地点打交道的时候，你并不是和质量－感知，而是和个人感知打交道。因此，就空间中的地点而言，并不需要什么复杂的安排来确保人与人之间达成协议。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth has dealt with the problem of mass-perception in the sessions on the creation of matter: 60. 73, among others. See Volume 2.)</td><td>(在谈物质创造的那几节，赛斯讨论过质量－感知的问题：第60至73节就是其中几节。见第二册。)</td></tr><tr><td>Each dream location is created by the individual precisely in the same way that I have explained to you; that is, they do not differ basically from physical locations, but in one degree. The difference is mainly that they need not be perceived by others.</td><td>每个梦地点都是个体完全按照我向你解释过的方式创造出来的；也就是说，它们与物质地点大同小异，基本上没有差别。差别主要在于它们不需要被其他人感知到。</td></tr><tr><td>The question however, in what dimensions do dream locations exist, was simply based. Nevertheless it is one that has many implications, for which you need more background. I will attempt a simplified explanation then. Do you remember some of the material that I gave concerning the expanding universe?</td><td>然而，梦地点存在于什么维度，这个问题的根据很简单。虽然如此，它却是一个隐含很多意义的问题，你需要更多的背景。我会试着用简化的方式加以解释。有关扩展的宇宙，我给过资料，你还记得其中一些吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes."</td><td>(“记得。”</td></tr><tr><td>(See sessions 42. 45.  But as early as the 15th session Seth was discussing these problems as related to dreams. All in Volume 1.)</td><td>(见42至45节，但是早在第15节，赛斯就在讨论这些与梦有关的问题了。这些全都在第一册。)</td></tr><tr><td>I said then that the universe expands in a way that has nothing to do with space. Now. A dream location exists, contracts or expands also in a way that has nothing to do with space as you understand it.</td><td>当时我说，宇宙是以一种和空间无关方式扩展。现在。梦地点存在、收缩或扩展的方式也和你们了解的空间无关。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break, and we shall continue.</td><td>我建议短暂休息一下，我们再继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:22. Jane had been dissociated as usual for a first delivery. Her pace had been good, her voice a bit stronger than usual, her eyes had remained closed. Jane said she had noticed the flash but had not been bothered by it when Peggy took the pictures.</td><td>(9:22休息。在第一段传述中，珍像往常一样出离。她的节奏一直很好，声音比平时有力一点，眼睛一直闭着。珍说在蓓拍照时，她注意到闪光灯但没有受到干扰。</td></tr><tr><td>(Peggy was having trouble composing a picture, she said, so for the next delivery she had Jane and me seat ourselves in another part of the room. We also moved about later in the session, but Jane kept using her favorite session chair, our Kennedy rocker.</td><td>(蓓说，她在寻找照片构图时遇到了麻烦，所以在接下来的传述中，她让珍和我自己坐在房间的另一边。我们在这一节稍后也四处移动，但珍继续坐在她最喜欢的椅子，我们的肯尼迪摇椅上。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth, or Jane had been engrossed in the material. Janes manner remained most emphatic when she resumed, again with her eyes closed, at 9:32.)</td><td>(赛斯或珍一直全神贯注在资料上。她在9:32分继续时，态度还是非常明确果决，眼睛再次闭上。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. I wish to congratulate Ruburt.</td><td>现在。我要恭喜鲁柏。</td></tr><tr><td>There is a rather important section in the work he did today. He hit upon something, and if he had continued working, then he would not have needed to ask me in what dimension dream locations exist. He was close to the answer. In this particular section he told the reader that he suspected that Freud’s terms, the ego, or the conscious and the subconscious, had in themselves led you seriously astray. Such is indeed the case.</td><td>在他今天所做的工作当中，有一个相当重要的章节。他无意间发现了什么东西，如果他继续努力，就不需要问我梦地点在什么维度了。他离答案很近了。在这个特定的章节，他告诉读者，他怀疑弗洛伊德的用语，自我或意识和潜意识，本身就严重误导你。事实确实如此。</td></tr><tr><td>For you see, you think that you are only conscious when you are focused in physical reality. You assume yourselves unconscious while you are sleeping. In Freud’s terminology, the dice are indeed loaded, on the side of the conscious mind.</td><td>因为你看，你们认为只有聚焦在物质实相的时候，你们才会有意识。你们以为在睡觉时，自己是无意识的。在弗洛伊德的用语中，在意识心那一边，骰子的确是灌了铅。</td></tr><tr><td>Pretend, all of you for a moment, that you are looking at this situation from the other side. Pretend that while you are in the dream state, you are concerned with the problem of consciousness and existence. From that viewpoint the picture is entirely different, for you are indeed conscious while you sleep.</td><td>你们全部都暂时假装一下，你们从另一边看着这个情况。假装你处于梦状态时，你关注意识和存在的问题。从这个角度来看，情况完全不同，因为你在睡觉时确实是有意识的。</td></tr><tr><td>The locations that you visit while dreaming are as real to you then as physical locations are to you in your waking state.</td><td>你在做梦时拜访的地点对你来说是真实的，就像在醒时状态中，实际地点对你而言一样真实。</td></tr><tr><td>What you have is this. Let us speak no more of a conscious self and a subconscious or unconscious self. There is one self, and it focuses its consciousness in various dimensions, and that is all.</td><td>你拥有的就是这个。我们不要再说有意识的自己和潜意识或无意识的自己了。只有一个自己，它把意识聚焦在各个不同的维度里，就是这样而已。</td></tr><tr><td>In the waking state the whole self is focused toward physical reality. In the dreaming state the whole self is focused within a different dimension. It is every bit as conscious and aware.</td><td>在醒时状态中，整个自己专注在物质实相。在梦中，整个自己聚焦在一个不同的维度。每一部分都一样有意识也有觉知。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. If you have little memory of your dream locations while you are in the waking state, then remember you have as little memory of waking locations when you are in the dream state. Both are legitimate, and both are realities.</td><td>现在。如果你在清醒状态中对梦地点没什么记忆，那就记住，当你处于梦状态时，你对醒时地点也一样没什么记忆。两者都是合理的，也都是实相。</td></tr><tr><td>For Ruburt then: When the physical body lies in bed, that physical body is separated by a vast distance from the dream location in which the dreaming self may dwell. But this distance, dear friends, has nothing to do with space. For the dream location exists simultaneously with the room in which the body dwells.</td><td>那么给鲁柏的是：当肉体躺在床上时，那个肉体与做梦的自己所在的梦地点相距无比遥远。但亲爱的朋友们，这个距离与空间一点关系都没有。因为梦地点与肉体所在的房间同时存在。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was most emphatic in giving this material, speaking in a good voice and with many gestures. Her pace was also good. Once in a while her eyes opened briefly. Peggy had been taking pictures, and as far as I could tell Jane was not bothered.)</td><td>(珍在给出这个资料时，非常用力强调，讲话的声音很好，手势也很多。她的节奏也很好。她的眼睛一度睁开了一会儿。蓓一直在拍照，而据我所知，珍没有受到干扰。)</td></tr><tr><td>The dream locations are not superimposed upon the chest and bed and chair. They exist composed of the very atoms and molecules that in the waking state you perceive as bed and chest and chair.</td><td>梦地点不是叠加在胸部以及床和椅子上。它们的存在正是由你在醒时状态感知为床和胸部以及椅子的原子和分子组成。</td></tr><tr><td>In the first place, the chest and bed and chair are only the results of your perception, and of your physical perception. From energy you form patterns which you recognize, and give names to and use, but the utility of these objects is useless to you unless you are focused within the dimension for which they were specifically formed.</td><td>首先，胸部以及床和椅子只是你的感知以及你的肉体知觉造成的结果。借着能量，你形成你认得的模式，并且为它命名和使用它，但这些物体的功用对你来说是无用的，除非你聚焦在专门形成它们的维度之内。</td></tr><tr><td>When, in the dream stare, you are focused in a different dimension, then you see you form from these same atoms and molecules the environment in which you will operate. Yet while you dream you cannot find the bed nor chest nor chair, and when you wake you cannot find the room or city or location which was there moments before.</td><td>在梦状态，当你聚焦在不同的维度时，那么你就会看到你借着这些相同的原子和分子形成你将在其中运作的环境。可是，当你做梦时，你找不到床、胸部和椅子，而当你醒来时，你找不到片刻之前在那里的房间、城市或地点。</td></tr><tr><td>It cannot be too strongly stressed that these dream locations are actualities. But as a rule they are personal actualities, without a general (underline general) mass framework. However mass dreams do occur (underlined). There are dreams that you share with others. There are dream environments that you share, as you share your physical environment. These are not as limiting however as that framework that holds together your physical reality. Nevertheless it does exist.</td><td>再怎么强调这些梦地点是确有其实都不为过。但是通常，它们是个人的事实，不具备一般的集体架构。然而，集体梦确实会发生。你和他人共享的梦是有的。你共享的梦环境是有的，就像你共享物质环境一样。不过，这些都不像那个把你的物质实相连结在一起的架构那么有限。但它确实存在。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take a break, and then we shall turn to our Dr. Instream material.</td><td>你可以休息一下，然后我们就开始来谈我们的殷斯翠姆博士资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:52. Jane was dissociated as usual, she said. Her eyes had been closed for the most part, her manner and gestures very emphatic. Peggy’s flashgun hadn't bothered her. A total of seven pictures had been taken by now.</td><td>(9:52休息。珍说，她一如往常出离了。大部分时间她的眼睛都是闭着的，她的举止和手势都充满着强调的意味。蓓的闪光灯并没有打扰她。到目前为止，总共拍了7张照片。</td></tr><tr><td>(It was time for the 50th Dr. Instream experiment. Janes pace and voice now changed to a slower tempo. Once more she sat with a hand raised to her closed eyes.

Now I believe that this refers to four photographs. One taken many years ago, in a location near a body of water. Four people in this photograph, parents and two children.</td><td>我有4的印象。现在，我相信这是指4张照片。一张是很多年前拍的，在一个靠近水边的地方。在这张照片上有4个人，父母和两个孩子。</td></tr><tr><td>An old-type photograph, and a connection with the year 1901. A connection with this photograph, and a two-or-three-story house, a frame house with brick or stone stairs at the front.</td><td>一张旧式照片，还有一个与1901年的关联。一个和这张照片相关的连结，以及一栋两层或三层的房子，一间前面有砖造成或石头楼梯的木屋。</td></tr><tr><td>Another photograph of a nephew who was in college, or of college age, when the photograph was taken.</td><td>另外的照片是一个在照片拍摄时上大学或大学生年纪的侄子。</td></tr><tr><td>Another single photograph of a child; also a photograph of a woman who is now the wife of the man to whom these photographs and the object belong.</td><td>另外一张是一个小孩；还有一张是一个女人的照片，她现在是这些照片和物品所有人的妻子。</td></tr><tr><td>I believe Dr. Instream chose this object precisely because it did not belong to him. A university connection is very strong here. The object belongs to another professor.</td><td>我相信殷斯翠姆博士之所以选择这个物件，正是因为它不属于他。这里和大学有一个很强的关联。该物件属于另一位教授。</td></tr><tr><td>Now for some general notes, still concerning Dr. Instream. He is working on, now, the next symposium. There is still some disagreement even as to rather general plans. This makes more specific details difficult to work out.</td><td>现在是一些一般地说明，仍然和殷斯翠姆博士有关。他现在正忙着一次的研究会。即使是相当笼统的计划，还是存在一些意见上的分歧。这使得更具体的细节难以解决。</td></tr><tr><td>There is some connection here also with a young girl, a child connected with Dr. Instream, but not with the symposium.</td><td>这里也和一个年轻女孩，一个与殷斯翠姆博士有关的孩子有些连结，但和研讨会没有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have an envelope for me, Joseph?</td><td>约瑟，你有信封要给我吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes.”</td><td>(“有。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused at 10:15. She took the usual sealed double envelope from me without opening her eyes. This was our 43rd experiment. Peggy was ready for more pictures.

I placed them between two pieces of Bristol and sealed them in the usual double envelope.</td><td>(第44次信封实验在课间举行。见上图的物件副本，并注意上图其中一张的背面副本。在第243节提到过这些卡片；这让我想到要用它们来做实验。珍最近读了第243节，但没看过卡片。事实上，打从1962年11月以来，她就没有见过它们了，因为已经存放在我的档案里。我将它们放在两块纸板之间，并密封在普通的双开信封内。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane had an unusual experience late last week, and I had one earlier today; we hoped Seth would discuss them this evening Here follows the material from our notebooks:</td><td>(珍上星期接近周末时有过一个不同寻常的经验，而我今天稍早也有过一次；我们希望赛斯今晚会讨论它们。以下是我们的笔记资料：</td></tr><tr><td>(lane: Thursday night, March 2a. I woke up sometime in the middle of the night and saw the form of a woman standing by Rob's side of the bed, not mine. The room was dark but I saw that her dress was blue. She was rather thin and fairly tall.</td><td>(珍：星期四晚上，3月24日。我在半夜的某个时候醒来，看到一个女人的形体站在罗的床边，而不是我的床边。房间很黑，但我看见她的连衣裙是蓝色的。她很瘦也相当高。</td></tr><tr><td>Her face was not clear at all but her dress was clearly visible—at least the color. It was one-piece, of moderate length. I do not remember her face at all. I do recall that our bookcase, behind her, showed up well; its cream color was clear although the rest of the room was dark. I believe her head was covered. As soon as I saw the figure it disappeared. I had the feeling that something was trying to make me forget what I saw, so I quickly woke Rob and told him what I had seen. The woman did not remind me of anyone I know, or had known.</td><td>她的脸一点都不清楚。我的确记得我们的书柜，在她身后，完整呈现；虽然房间的其他部分都很暗，但是，某个东西试图让我忘记我看见的景象，所以我很快叫醒罗，告诉他我看到什么。这个女人并没有让我想起任何我现在认识或以前知道的人。</td></tr><tr><td>(Rob: Monday, March 28, 5:45 PM. After doing my daily yoga exercises for about half an hour, I lay relaxed and in a drowsy state. I then became aware that I was hearing voices. They were speaking at a normal rate; I was aware of two men, not old, seated at desks. I think the desks were old and battered, a brown color. I heard  their words with exceptional clarity, sentence by sentence, including the timbre of their voices, etc., and retained them briefly. I soon forgot them however. One of the men laughed, in a deep and pleasant, friendly way.</td><td>(罗：星期一，3月28日，下午5:45分。做了大约半个小时的每日瑜珈练习之后，我躺着放松，进入一种昏昏欲睡的状态。然后我觉察到我听到声音。他们以正常的速度说话；我注意到有两个男人，不老，坐在桌前。我想桌子又破又旧，褐色的。他们的话语，我听得异常清晰，一句接一句，包括他们的音色等等，而且听过还能记得一会儿。但我很快就忘了。其中一个男人笑出声来，音调低沉、愉快。</td></tr><tr><td>( I then realized I was also “seeing" one of the men, the one who had laughed. I did not see his companion as the voice exchange continued. The one in my vision was a thin man in shirt sleeves, perhaps in his late thirties, with thick straight brown hair combed straight back, a thin very friendly face with a generous mouth. His voice was deep and gentle. I thought the other voice belonged to an older man with glasses and white hair, though I did not see this person. I saw no details of their surroundings, not even walls. End.</td><td>(然后我发觉我也“看到”其中一个男人，那个发出过笑声的人。声音的交谈继续下去的同时，我并没有看见他的同伴。在我视象里的那个男人是一个只穿衬衫的瘦削男人，年纪也许30多岁，浓密的棕色直发往后梳，非常友善的瘦脸有一张宽厚的嘴。他的声音低沉又轻柔。我认为另一个声音属于一个戴眼镜、白头发的年长男人，虽然我没有看到这个人。我没有看到他们周围的任何细节，甚至连墙壁都没有。结束。</td></tr><tr><td>(This is the first time Jane has had such an experience in the waking state, although she has seen many things in psychological time experiments. She is positive she was awake when she saw the woman.</td><td>(这是珍在醒时状态第一次有这样的经验，虽然她在心理时间实验里看过很多东西。她很肯定她看见那个女人的时候是醒着的。</td></tr><tr><td>(l have long been aware that the yoga exercises have a powerful effect on me personally, and that I evidently end up in a dissociated state at times after doing them. I have neither encouraged or discouraged this effect. I have had the experience of hearing voices before but have not asked Seth to comment. He did mention my hearing music recently. The last time I heard  voices they chattered away at a great rate, like a tape played too fast.</td><td>(我早就觉察到练习对我个人的影响很大，而且有时候在做完之后，我最后显然进入一种出离状态。我既不助长也不阻止这种效应。我之前也有过听见声音的经验，但没有要求赛斯评论过。他确实提到过，我最近听见音乐。我最后一次听声音是，它们以极快的速度喋喋不休，就像录音带播放得太快了。</td></tr><tr><td>(See page 280 for a description of my first experience involving strong visual and bodily data while in the waking state. Seth dealt with this in the 24th session and subsequent ones. See Volume 1.</td><td>(见第一册，其中描述了我在醒时状态第一次涉及到强烈视觉和身体资料的经验。赛斯在第24节以及其后的课中讨论过这件事。</td></tr><tr><td>( The session was held in the front room. Jane began speaking at a slow rate, and with her eyes closed. She was smoking however and her eyes soon began to open for brief periods. Her voice was average.)</td><td>(这一节在前面的房间举行。珍一开始讲话速度缓慢，闭着眼睛。然而，她在抽烟，她的眼睛不久就开始不时张开一下。她的声音不高不低。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth. ")</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯”)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. We shall have a quiet session. I shall deal with matters that are connected with you both.</td><td>现在。我们这一节应该会很安静。我会讨论那些与你们两个都有关联的事情。</td></tr><tr><td>We shall start with your experience, Joseph, of this afternoon. You were in a very passive state. This passivity comes rather easily to you under such conditions, as those that existed at the time.</td><td>我们从你，约瑟，今天下午的经验谈起。你处于非常被动的状态。在这样的状况下，就像当时存在的那些状况一样，这种被动很容易发生在你身上。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was speaking leisurely. She took time out to put out her cigarette and sip some wine, her eyes blinking.)</td><td>(珍说话的样子一派悠哉。她抽出时间熄灭香烟，喝了一些酒，眨了眨眼睛。)</td></tr><tr><td>I want to make myself clear here, so I am speaking slowly. Conditions that come about during your exercises bring forth this passive state, with you personally. Now this passivity is good, and you use it well. It also comes more easily to you however, because you have always been given to solitude and introspection.</td><td>这里我想要把话说清楚，所以我慢慢讲。在你练习期间出现的状况，对你个人造成了这种被动状态。现在这种被动是好的，你也用得好。然而，它也比较容易发生在你身上，因为你一向偏好孤独和内省。</td></tr><tr><td>This is not to be overdone however. The daily exercise period is fine. The tendencies are used and developed for the good of the overall personality. It is important that they continue to be so disciplined. I do not suggest that you give more time to this daily period however, now.</td><td>但是，这不要做过头。每天练习的时段很好。为了整体人格的利益，要使用和发展种种倾向。重要的是，继续这样维持它们的纪律。我不建议你现在把更多时间留给每天的这个时段。</td></tr><tr><td>The period should result in a feeling of refreshment. Your energies afterwards however should be directed outward. You are doing very well indeed, and not overdoing it. There is a good balance here. I simply want to point out that here certain characteristics are being well used. They could also be ill-used, and so the energy should then be directed outward, as indeed it is since the supper hour so shortly follows.</td><td>这个时段应该会带来一种神清气爽的感觉。然而，之后就应该要往外引导你的能量。你确实做得很好，而且没有做过头。这里有一个很好地平衡。我只是想指出，这里某些特性正被充分利用。它们也可能被不常使用，所以接着应该要往外引导能量，而在晚餐后不久，状况也的确是如此。</td></tr><tr><td>Now for today’s experience. You tuned in telepathically to a group of people, I believe in the Midwest. Their own abilities are well developed.</td><td>现在来谈今天的经验。你透过心电感应与一群人接上线，我相信地点是中西部。他们自己的能力发展得很充分。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane now took a long pause at 9:15. (Geography is not one of her strong points, as the next sentence shows, but she has an unerring sense of direction.)</td><td>(9:13，此时珍停顿良久。地理不是她的强项之一，从下一句话就可看出，但她的方向感万无一失。)</td></tr><tr><td>I believe the state was Wyoming. In your passive state you were a receiver. The room in which they sat was simple, and unadorned. No rug upon the floor. The young man whose face you saw is someone much like yourself as far as personal characteristics and temperament are concerned.</td><td>我相信这个州是怀俄明州。在你的被动状态中，你是接收者。他们坐的房间很简单，朴实无华。地板上没有地毯。就个人的特征和气质而言，你打过照面的那个年轻人和你自己很像。</td></tr><tr><td>(Our cat Willy had been eating in the kitchen. Ordinarily he pays no attention to the sessions, after his early displays when the sessions first began; at that time, according to Seth, he sensed Seth's presence and reacted strongly. He has since grown used to this.</td><td>(我们的猫威立一直在厨房吃东西。在我们的课刚开始的时候，它有一些早期的表现，但之后通常它对我们的课完全置之不理；那时，根据赛斯的说法，它感觉到赛斯的临在而且反应强烈。从那时起，它已经习惯了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Tonight Willy merely wanted to play. I would have preferred that Jane not be interrupted at this point, but Willy lost a toy in back of a bookcase. He made so much noise I had to lay my notes aside to take care of him. Jane waited, her eyes closed.)</td><td>(今晚威立纯粹只是想玩。我本来希望珍在这个节骨眼上不要被打断，但威立掉了一个玩具在书柜后面，发出了很大的声响，我不得不把笔记放在一边，去料理它一下。珍等着，双眼闭上。)</td></tr><tr><td>Are you ready?</td><td>你准备好了吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes.")</td><td>(“好了。”)</td></tr><tr><td>There was an attraction for this reason. The group sat in a large cabin-type room, in mountainous country, I believe in the northwest portion of the state. The location begins with an’s or’s sound, but we will try to be more specific shortly.</td><td>由于这个原因，所以有一种吸引力。这群人坐在一个小木屋类型的大房间里，在山区，我相信是在该州的西北部。地点名称的首字母是S，或发S音，但我们会尽快提供更具体的讯息。</td></tr><tr><td>(This was the question I wanted answered more than any other.)</td><td>(这是我最想要听到答案的问题。)</td></tr><tr><td>Because of your state of mind, the people in that room subconsciously felt your presence. Had conditions been better it is possible that they would have sensed you more directly, or even formed a telepathic image of you, as you formed one of them.</td><td>由于你的心智状态，那个房间里的人在潜意识上感受到你的临在。要是状况更好的话，他们可能会更直接感应到你，甚至形成你的一个心电感应形象，就像你形成他们其中一人的形象那样。</td></tr><tr><td>It should be remembered here that all physical images of other individuals are basically telepathic images, formed subconsciously by the perceiver.</td><td>这里应该记住，其他个体的物质形像基本上都是感知者在潜意识上形成的心电感应形象。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:21. Jane was pretty well dissociated, she said. Her eyes remained closed as the session progressed; they looked heavy and bleary at break. She had taken many short pauses.</td><td>(9:21休息。珍说，她出离得颇为彻底。随着课的进行，她的眼睛一直是闭着的；休息时，两眼看起来沉重又朦胧。她有过很多次短暂地停顿。</td></tr><tr><td>( I could think of several Wyoming places beginning with the appropriate sound, but did not mention them to Jane. We had driven through the state several years ago, but Jane did not remember doing so. Nor did she recall any city or town names in the state. She said she had the idea of Cisco for a place name in the state, but thought she had chosen this because it has a western sound. It can qualify however under the’s sound mentioned by Seth.</td><td>(我可以想到怀俄明州几个发音符合的地方，但没有对珍提起它们。几年前我们曾经开车经过该州，但珍不记得我们这么做过。她也想不起任何市镇的名字。她说她想到西斯柯[Cisco]是该州的一个地名，但她以为她之所以选这个，是因为它有种西部的音调。不过，它算得上符合赛斯提到的开头发S的音。</td></tr><tr><td>(We were interested in a specific location especially in view of Seths mentioning people with well-developed abilities. If this referred to psychic abilities I thought we could write them. We know of no such organizations in Wyoming. Perhaps I could include a drawing of the face I saw so clearly. We have an outdated state atlas on a closet shelf and Jane agreed not to look at it in case we did not get a place name this evening.</td><td>(我们对一个特定的地点感兴趣，尤其是因为赛斯提到能力发展良好的人。如果这指的是心灵能力，我认为我们可以写出来。我们知道在怀俄明州没有这样的组织，也许我可以把我看得很清楚的那张脸画成素描。我们在衣柜层板上有一本过时的全国地图集，珍同意不去看它，以防万一我们今晚没有接收到地名。</td></tr><tr><td>(She said she did not think it would help if she did look at a map of the state.</td><td>(她说，如果她确实看了该州的地图，她认为不会有帮助。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same manner, with pauses and with her eyes closed, a 9:31.)</td><td>(9:31，珍以同样的方式继续，偶有停顿，眼睛闭上。)</td></tr><tr><td>We are going to confine ourselves this evening to the kind of discussion we have begun.</td><td>我们今晚的讨论要限定在我们已经开始的主题上。</td></tr><tr><td>You, Joseph, are now learning to use your inner intuitions and inner abilities, and to focus them also outward creatively in your work, and also in your own physical activities and environment.</td><td>你，约瑟，现在正在学习利用你的内在直觉和内在能力，也学着将它们充满创造力地往外聚焦在你的工作，以及你自己的肉体活动和环境上。</td></tr><tr><td>In the past years you had a tendency to use them haphazardly and with no idea as to how they should be directed. They can and will transform your psychic and physical environment. The one main test to be applied to these sessions, to my advice and to the material is this: The sessions, the material and your new knowledge must transform your psychic and physical environment, your health and all aspects of your inner and outer life for the better. And I believe that we are doing this.</td><td>在过去几年里，你有随意使用它们的倾向，而且不知道应该如何引导它们。它们能够也将会转化你的心灵和物质环境。会应用在这些课、在我的建议、在资料上的一个主要考验就是这个：课、资料和你的新知识，必须转化你的心灵和物质环境、你的健康以及你内在和外在生命的所有面向，让它们变得更好。而且我相信我们正在这样做。</td></tr><tr><td>The overall state of your health at this time is a direct result of the knowledge that you have gained and used. You are in a good state of health, and as we continue you will be in a state of exuberant health.</td><td>此时你的整体健康状态是你所获得和使用的知识造成的直接结果。你的健康状态良好，而且在我们继续下去的同时，你的健康也会处于生气勃勃的状态。</td></tr><tr><td>Now since this session is a rather personal one I have some comments to Ruburt before I discuss his experience. At least a year ago I suggested that a room divider be kept up to divide his working area. I specifically mentioned the benefits that could be expected from such an arrangement, and I now most strongly repeat my remarks, suggesting that the present arrangement be kept, or another divider substituted.</td><td>现在，由于这一节是相当私人的课，所以在讨论他的经验之前，我对鲁柏有些评论。至少在一年前，我建议用房间隔板划分他的工作区域。我特别提到这样一个安排可以带来的好处，我现在要非常用力地重复我的看法，建议保留目前的安排，或是用另一种隔板代替。</td></tr><tr><td>Either one should be permanent. Your home situation will be much more stable for one thing, and such an arrangement is really necessary for Ruburts efficiency. It enables him to direct his energy where he wants it, when he wants it. The divider may only be a symbol but it is a necessary one. It is the symbol for a discipline on his part that will enable him to override the vicissitudes of mood, and temporary inclinations.</td><td>两者都应该是永久的。一方面你的居家情况会稳定很多，而且这样的安排对于鲁柏的效率来说确实是必要的。这使他能够在他想要的时候把能量引导到他想要的地方。隔板可能只是一个象征，但它是必需的。对他来说，这是纪律的象征，将使他能够克服心情的变换和暂时的倾向。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. What he saw was not an hallucination.</td><td>现在，他看到的不是幻觉。</td></tr><tr><td>I have told you that many other systems coexist with your own, simultaneously. Other fields exist that you do not perceive with your physical senses. Ruburt was not perceiving with his own physical senses, nor was he asleep.</td><td>我告诉过你, 很多其他系统与你们自己的系统同时共存。其他你用你的肉体感官感知不到的场域是存在的。当时鲁柏不是用他自己的肉体感官在感知，他也不是睡着。</td></tr><tr><td>The image had no specific personal meaning for him at all. He simply perceived a woman, a survival personality if you prefer. She was standing motionless within her own system, and momentarily the two systems coincided, which is not at all unusual.</td><td>这个意象对他来说根本没有特定的个人意义。他只是感知到一个女人，如果你比较喜欢，也可以说是一个死后犹存的人格。她一动不动站在她自己的系统之内，而这两个系统暂时重叠，这根本一点都不稀奇。</td></tr><tr><td>What is unusual is that Ruburt was able to use his perceptions fully to see within the patterns of the physical system, or to see through them to the patterns formed by another system.</td><td>稀奇的是，鲁柏能够充分利用他的感知，进入物质系统模式之内，或穿过它们，看到另一个系统形成的模式。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, both systems exist in actuality. Usually you only perceive your own. Ruburt turned off his usual focus of perception. He focused it differently, and so saw an image of which he would normally not be aware.</td><td>现在, 两个系统都存在于现实之中。通常你只感知到你自己的系统。鲁柏关掉了他平常的感知焦点。他以不同的方式聚焦他的感知，因此看到了他平常没有知觉的意象。</td></tr><tr><td>The woman left your own physical system not long ago, according to your terms. She had a connection with this house, though not with you. She was a friend of the woman above you. This is the first time that Ruburt has allowed himself such freedom of perception, and he shall have other such experiences.</td><td>按照你们的说法，这个女人不久前离开了你们的物质系统。她和这间房子有连结，但是和你们没有连结。她是你们楼上那个女人的一个朋友。这是鲁柏第一次容许他自己有这样的感知自由，他应该还会有其他这样的经验。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I suggest a break.</td><td>现在我建议休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:56. Jane was again well dissociated, she said. Her eyes had remained closed. She had spoken with many pauses and gestures.</td><td>(9:56休息。珍说，她再次完全出离。她的眼睛一直闭着。她说话时有很多停顿和手势。</td></tr><tr><td>(A single woman named Lucy lives in a small apartment above our own. A woman friend of hers died a few months ago. Neither Jane or I had ever met Lucy's friend but we recall hearing about her death through Lucy. We remember in particular because the dead woman 's relatives gave Lucy her television set.</td><td>(一个名叫露西[Lucy]的单身女人，住在我们家上面的小公寓里。几个月前，她的一位女性朋友去世了。珍和我都没有见过露西的朋友，但我们记得听过露西说到她的死亡。我们之所以特别记得，是因为这位女性死者的亲戚把她的电视机送给露西。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane has always wanted to see an apparition, or survival personality, and now has had her wish. She said the experience was not frightening at all.</td><td>(珍一直想看见幽灵或是死后犹存的人格，现在她如愿以偿了。她说这种经验一点都不可怕。</td></tr><tr><td>( I asked Jane to keep these questions in mind, perhaps to be answered by Seth later in the session: Was the survival personality aware of Jane? Can Seth be more specific about the location in Wyoming, and the group 's abilities?</td><td>(我要求珍记住这些问题，也许赛斯会在这一节后面回答：死后犹存的人格有没有觉察到珍？赛斯能不能更具体说明怀俄明州的地点以及那群人的能力？</td></tr><tr><td>(It was now time for the 51st Dr. Instream experiment. As usual Jane sat with a hand to her closed eyes, speaking slowly. Resume at 10:05.)</td><td>(现在是进行第51次殷斯翠姆博士实验的时候了。和往常一样，珍坐着，一只手放在闭着的眼睛上，慢慢说话。10:05继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Give us a moment please for our Instream material.</td><td>现在。请给我们一点时间取得我们的殷斯翠姆博士资料。</td></tr><tr><td>A shell. A man’s hat on a table next to a shell, such as a seashell. A cluttered desk. I believe Dr. Instream is in his own office at the college, now. (Pause at 10:07.) He has had a male visitor within the hour.</td><td>一个贝壳。桌子上有一顶男用帽在一个贝壳旁边，比如海贝。一张杂乱的桌子。我相信殷斯翠姆博士此时在大学里他自己的办公室。(停顿10:07)不到一小时前，他见过一个男性访客。</td></tr><tr><td>Earlier this evening there was a meeting which both men attended. The visitor was tall and thin, dark, with glasses. Perhaps the frames were also dark. At least they were thick frames, rather than thin ones. His face narrow.</td><td>今晚早些时候，两人参加了一个会议。来访者又高又瘦、肤色深、戴眼镜。也许镜框也是深色的。至少是厚框，而不是薄框。他的脸是窄的。</td></tr><tr><td>Either he is dark-completed also, or slightly in need of a shave. The sides of his face appear not smooth, as if stubble, very slight, or poor complexion here. English ears. Perhaps the man is Jewish. Quite tall.</td><td>他要不是肤色深，就是需要刮胡子了。他的脸颊看起来不光滑，好像有胡茬，非常少，或是气色很差。耳朵偏长。也许这个人是犹太人。颇高。</td></tr><tr><td>They discussed a location in another state, rather distant. Perhaps another college or foundation. I believe to the west rather than to the east however.</td><td>他们讨论了另一个州的一个地点，很远。也许是另一所大学或基金会。不管怎样，我相信是在西部而不是东部。</td></tr><tr><td>The other man is interested also in music. He has an unusual cigarette holder or lighter, which I believe Dr. Instream has noticed. There is a connection with this item and a dog’s head, or dog-shaped head. That is, an animal head either symbolized on the item, or in the shape of it. The man also has a dog.</td><td>另一个男人也对音乐有兴趣。他有一个不寻常的烟嘴或打火机，我相信殷斯翠姆博士注意到了。这个物品和一颗狗头或狗造型的头有关联。也就是说，在这个物品或它的形状上有一个动物头的象征图案。那个男人也有一只狗。</td></tr><tr><td>There is a connection with the man and a foreign country. Not a northern one. Some distant connection with the man and Milan, and a paten with an unusual occupation.</td><td>男人和一个异邦有关联。不是北方的国家。男人和米兰有某种遥远的关联，父亲或母亲有着不寻常的职业。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have an envelope for me, Joseph?</td><td>约瑟，你有信封要给我吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes.”</td><td>(“有。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused at 10:16. Without opening her eyes she took the envelope for our 44th experiment from me, and pressed it to her forehead.)</td><td>(珍在10:16停顿。没有睁开眼睛，她就从我手上拿了我们第44次实验的信封，并把它压在她的额头上。)</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment, please. These are impressions.</td><td>请给我们一点时间。这些都是印象。</td></tr><tr><td>A connection with a merger, and something spontaneous. A meeting. A connection with a trip. Ornamentation connected with the object. Squares. A date on it. I think of July or April.</td><td>与一次合并以及某个自发的东西有关联。一场集会，与一场旅行有关联。与这个物品有连结的装饰。正方形。它上面的一个日期。我想到7月或4月。</td></tr><tr><td>A connection with your place of employment. A large circular shape on a rectangular pattern, and movement. The object, the round object, seems to have something to do with motion.</td><td>和你的工作地点有关联。在一个长方形图案上的一个大圆形以及动作。这个物件，这个圆形物体，似乎和动作有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>A connection with a family group, of one, five, three and two. A specific address.

But the question confused her; this is the first time this has happened. Jane said she had an image of a "round object", that had to do with motion, but had no idea as to what it represented.</td><td>(珍说，当我询问家族团体时，她知道她传述的资料离题了，不过信封物件确实提到了家庭团体。但这个问题让她感到困惑；这是第一次发生这种情况。珍说她有一个意象是一个“圆形物体”，与动作有关，但不知道它代表什么。</td></tr><tr><td>(We made some connections ourselves, and Seth elaborated on others. At times during the data I wasn't sure who was speaking--Jane or Seth. Sometimes when Ruburt was mentioned, I thought it was Jane saying so, rather than Seth. After the session Jane said she had no awareness along these hues, but one of confusion concerning the data. Knowing it was wrong somehow, she tried to be objective, to get back on the right track without knowing how to go about it. There was a confusion of levels, she said, that left her groping.</td><td>(我们自己找出了一些关联，赛斯则详细说明其他的关联。有时在传述资料期间，我不确定是谁在说话——珍或赛斯。有时候当鲁柏被提及时，我以为是珍这么说的，而不是赛斯。珍说，她对这方面毫无知觉，只对资料有一点疑惑。不知为何晓得它是错的，她试图客观以待、回到正轨，却不知道怎么做才好。她说，有一种对程度的困惑，让她一直在摸索。</td></tr><tr><td>(See the tracings on page 51. 52.

In the phone book the school at which we received the vaccine on each occasion is listed by avenue, but no number is given.</td><td>(“与一个家族团体有关联，其中有1、5、3和2。”两个信封物件都和家族团体有关联。我们不确定这些数字是指什么。卡片上提到了第一型、第二型和第三型小儿麻痹疫苗，但是5却找不到解释。这些数字也不完全符合我们的家族团体。在电话簿中，我们每次接种疫苗的学校都是按照道路列出，但是没有号码。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A specific address.

Ruburt noticed a large orange sun, drawn by a child, in the hallway of the school. Something else here: He equated the cube with a large pill, which would be round and difficult to swallow.</td><td>和大圆形有模糊的关联。鲁柏注意到一个橘色的大太阳，小孩子画的，在学校的走廊里。这里还有别的东西：他把方块和一颗大药丸画上等号，那颗药丸是圆的、很难吞下。</td></tr><tr><td>(A note: Jane doesn't like to take pills. She will often put off taking them.

In two recent envelope experiments involving my place of employment, this word had cropped up in connection with the death of an older fellow worker; mine referring to grave, or underground, because Jane instinctively disliked the idea of graves. The older worker had been named hzra Havens.

Death does not automatically bring enlightenment or development. Those that are muddled continue to be muddled. Individual differences always operate.</td><td>她的能力现在没有比过去增长多少。死亡并不会自动带来启蒙或发展。那些糊里糊涂的，还是继续糊里糊涂。个体差异永远有作用。</td></tr><tr><td>Death brings a certain knowledge that things have changed, as on earth you know when you have walked from one room to another, but nothing can automatically make the survival personality understand or perceive clearly the new conditions.</td><td>死亡带来一定程度的知识，晓得事情发生了变化，就像在地球上你知道你从一个房间走到另一个房间一样，但是没有任何东西能够自动让死后犹存的人格清楚了解或感知新的状况。</td></tr><tr><td>A developed personality will perceive them as he would perceive new conditions in the physical environment. An undeveloped personality will keep his characteristic attitude and capabilities. There is some difference, naturally, but the degree of perception is determined by the personality itself.</td><td>一个发展成熟的人格会感知到新的状况，就像他们在物质环境感知到新的状况一样。一个发展不成熟的人格会维持他特有的态度和才能。当然，是有一些差异，但是感知程度取决于人格本身。</td></tr><tr><td>Some understanding is almost automatic, simply because some elements are unmistakably different. You must understand however that basic characteristics of the personality as a whole operate more fully after death. Subconscious drives for good are liberated from egotistical fears. Do you have any other questions?</td><td>某些理解几乎是自动的，仅仅因为某些元素的不同是毫无疑问的。然而，你必须明白，整个人格的基本特性在死后会更加充分地运作。潜意识的驱力永远摆脱了种种以自我为中心的恐惧？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Was the woman Jane saw aware that she had died?”)</td><td>(“珍看见的那个女人，意识到自己已经死了吗？)</td></tr><tr><td>In this case yes, but this is not always the case.

With their young friend Ann Diebler, they have witnessed a very few unscheduled sessions.

Don plans to bring a camera and flash also. Jane is 37, I'm 46.</td><td>(我们的年轻友人玛丽莲和唐·韦伯今晚在课前来探望我们，但没有留下来上课。和他们的年轻友人安·黛伯乐一起，他们3人见证了少数几节临时课。他们一直在读一些早期的资料，现在想参加一堂定期课，所以就安排他们来见证第247节。唐也计划带上相机和闪光灯。珍现在37岁，我46岁。</td></tr><tr><td>( I became acquainted with Marilyn and Ann at my place of employment. Marilyn no longer works there because she has a son, but Ann still does. As stated before, these young people have asked Jane and me many interesting questions about the material, and other related subjects. Some of the questions have been surprisingly acute, and their general reactions have not been what we might have expected. They have become genuinely interested in the ESP field, and this in spite of a rather deliberate lack of pushing on our part. In turn, they have sparked an interest in some of their friends of their own age.</td><td>(我在我的工作地点认识了玛丽莲和安。玛丽莲不再在那里工作了，因为她有一个儿子，但安还在职。以前说过，这些年轻人向珍和我提出很多关于这份资料，以及其他相关主题的有趣问题。有些问题敏锐得令人惊讶，而且他们的整体反应也出乎我们的预期。尽管我们颇为刻意不勉强，他们却对ESP领域以及这个真的产生了兴趣。反过来，他们还引发了一些同龄朋友的兴趣。</td></tr><tr><td>(We wondered whether Seth would be able to come through with the Wyoming location also, in respect to the data given in the last session. This concerned my tuning in telepathically on a small group in that state. According to Seth they have well-developed abilities. My experience took place Monday, March 28 at supper time.</td><td>(我们也想知道赛斯能不能就上一节给出的资料，把怀俄明州的地点传过来。这和我经由心灵感应与那一州的一个小团体接上线有关联。据赛斯说，他们具有充分发展的能力。我的经验发生在3月28日星期一的晚餐时间。</td></tr><tr><td>(The session was held in our font room.

I would like to make a few remarks concerning your friends.</td><td>现在。我想针对你的朋友们发表一些看法。</td></tr><tr><td>You have no idea, Joseph, of your effect upon the young people with whom you come in contact, at your place of employment in particular. You have met them at a crucial period in their lives. Indeed, you are teaching them to think.</td><td>约瑟，你不知道，你对你有接触的年轻人是有影响力的，尤其是在你的工作地点。你在他们生命中的关键时期遇到他们。确切地说，你正在教他们思考。</td></tr><tr><td>Your influence upon them is much stronger than you believe, and you have already changed their lives in rather important and beneficial ways. In the not too distant past you were not able to help others to this degree.</td><td>你对他们的影响远大过于你相信的程度，而你已经以相当重要和有益的方式改变了他们的生命。在不是那么遥远的过去，你没有能力帮助别人到这种程度。</td></tr><tr><td>The two who were here this evening, and their friend called Ann, these three are capable of developing in ways that were denied them in their earlier years, mainly because of their environments. Every effort should be made, within reason or course, to stimulate their intellectual curiosity and develop their inner capabilities.</td><td>这两个今晚在这里的人，以及他们那位名字叫作安的朋友，这3个人有能力以他们早年被剥夺的方式发展，那主要是因为他们的环境所致。应该尽一切努力激发他们的求知欲，开发他们的内在能力，但当然是在合情合理的范围内。</td></tr><tr><td>A meeting together once a month for the purpose of answering their questions, explaining our material, would be most beneficial. This would not be a social affair however, per se, and that should be clearly understood. Through these people you have also influenced their circle of relatives and friends, though to a lesser degree.</td><td>每个月聚会一次，以便回答他们的问题、解释我们的资料，会非常有帮助。然而，这件事本身不是社交活动，这点应该要了解清楚。透过这些人，你也影响了他们的亲友圈，虽然程度比较轻。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane and I have met none of the relatives and friends.)</td><td>(珍和我没有见过任何一个亲友。)</td></tr><tr><td>Generally, for the first time, you and Ruburt are bringing the world of books to these people, the young people, for the first time. Your own artistic endeavors have influenced the young woman who was here this evening. You have completely changed and broadened their conception of what adults are like, at a time when they found no mutual correspondence with the adults that they had known.</td><td>一般来说，第一次，你和鲁柏第一次正在把书的世界带给这些人、年轻人。你自己在艺术上的努力影响了今晚在这里的年轻女子。正当他们从他们认识的成年人身上找不到共同点的时候，你彻底改变和拓宽了他们对成年人的看法。</td></tr><tr><td>Both of you also benefit by the encounters, and it is of course up to you to direct the relationships along the lines that are most fruitful. This after all presents no difficulties, since they will follow your lead. The gift given you this evening was given in a wordless attempt to express appreciation.</td><td>你们两个也受益于这些邂逅，要把关系引导到最有成效的方向，当然是由你来决定。毕竟这没有任何困难，因为他们会跟随你的带领。今晚送给你的礼物是以远方的行动表达赞赏。</td></tr><tr><td>(This evening Marilyn gave Jane and me a flowerpot that she had made in ceramics class.)</td><td>(今晚玛丽莲送给珍和我一个她在陶瓷课制作的花盆。)</td></tr><tr><td>If your Friday get-togethers have become boring, it is to a large extent because you have both allowed them to do so, and not taken the lead in directing the conversations along more responsible lines. For these young people can offer much. They look at things with fresh minds, and their questions can lead both of you along new lines of thought.</td><td>如果你的周五聚会变得无聊，那在很大程度上是因为你们两人都允许他们这样做，而不是带头把对话引导到更负责任的方向。因为这些年轻人能够提供很多贡献。他们用清晰的心智看待事物，他们的问题可以带领你们两人走上新的思考方向。</td></tr><tr><td>(“ They already have in some respects.”)</td><td>(“在某些方面，他们已经是如此。”)</td></tr><tr><td>I do not want to take any more time with this discussion. But I did want to impress you with these facts. The relationship between you and Ruburt also gives the young couple the basis upon which to build their own life together, and such a basis was quite necessary for them.</td><td>我不想再花时间讨论这个问题。但我确实想用这些事实给你留下深刻的印象。你和鲁柏之间的关系也给了这对年轻夫妇一个基础，他们可以在这个基础上一起建立自己的生活，而且这样一个基础对他们来说是非常必要的。</td></tr><tr><td>One more note. These are the people, you see, we want to reach, for they are young and they can learn, and they are not hampered by old theories. Through watching them, you see, you can observe the effect that our material has on their daily lives. This is the material in its functional working dimensions, and that is very important.</td><td>再说一件事。这些人，你知道，就是我们想要触及的人，因为他们年轻，他们可以学习，他们不受旧理论束缚。透过留意他们，你看，我们可以观察到我们的资料对他们的日常生活有何影响。这就是这份资料的实用面向，而且这非常重要。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take a brief break and we shall continue along other lines.</td><td>你可以稍微休息一下，我们将继续谈其他方面的主题。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:22. Jane was dissociated as usual for a first delivery. Her pace had begun to pick up finally.

I have some remarks to make. You are taking the first steps toward a much more enjoyable, flexible, and fulfilling existence.</td><td>现在。我有一些话要说。你正朝着更加愉快、灵活又充实的存在迈出最初的步伐。</td></tr><tr><td>I mean this, in the fullest context of those words. You are acting incidentally not as parents in those terms at all, but more as teachers. To some extent you are a teacher in your painting, Joseph. What you want is a more flexible arrangement. If possible get away from the idea of weeknights and weekends, for this is hampering to some degree.</td><td>我是就这些字词最完整的背景来说这句话的。在那些方面，你一点都没有在不经意间表现得像父母，而是比较像老师。在某种程度上，约瑟，你在你的绘画中是一个老师。你想要的是一个更灵活的安排。如果可能的话，远离周末夜和周末的想法，因为这会造成某种程度的阻碍。</td></tr><tr><td>Make no mistake. You gain also in your relationships with these young people when you direct the relationship along desired lines. If it were allowed to continue as it is, it would have disintegrated on both sides, and to some good extent you would have failed, in that you would not have helped them as much as you could have had you been wiser. And you would have deprived yourselves of what they had to give.</td><td>别误会了。当你把你和这些年轻人的关系引导到想要的方向时，你也是有收获的。要是容许它照这样继续下去，两边都会解体，并且在很大程度上你会失败，因为你给他们的帮助不会像你更有智慧的时候那么多。你自己也会丧失他们必得给予的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>You are simply beginning something new. Make your own arrangements along the lines I have suggested. You will find your daily lives more fulfilling, and will notice it at once. These young people also feel quite legitimately, though subconsciously, that you are beginning to let them down. For the relationship begins to disintegrate into the social discourse they could get anywhere else.</td><td>你就只是开始体验新事物。按照我建议的方向，自行安排。你将会发现你的日常生活更加充实，而且立刻就会注意到。虽然是在潜意识上，但这些年轻人也相当合情合理地感觉你开始让他们失望。因为这个关系开始瓦解，变成他们在其他任何地方都能够得到的社交应酬。</td></tr><tr><td>They think very much of you both, and are easily hurt when you are not being honest, for they realize this instinctively. They are not hurt by honesty.</td><td>他们对你们两人的评价很高，当你们不诚实的时候，他们很容易受到伤害，因为他们凭着本能了解这一点。诚实不会伤害他们。</td></tr><tr><td>Now let us change the subject. I am pleased with the outline that Ruburt prepared for another book. And that book, when it is written, will be an excellent one, and a major contribution.</td><td>现在让我们来换个主题。鲁柏为另一本书准备的大纲，我很满意。而那本书，在写完以后，将会是一本非常出色的书，也会是一个重大的贡献。</td></tr><tr><td>(The other morning in a burst of inspiration Jane wrote out a fill outline, including chapter breakdown, of the book she intends to write after she finishes the first book on the Seth Material, and the book on dreams that she now has well under way.</td><td>(前几天早上，在一次灵感的爆发中，珍写出一份完整的大纲，包括章节的细分在内，这是她打算在完成第一本谈赛斯资料的书，以及她此时已经顺利进行中的一本谈梦的书之后要写的书。</td></tr><tr><td>(The new book is titled The Expansion of Human Consciousness. Jane wrote the outline for it in less than an hour, and says the process of intuition responsible for it was much like that which led to her production of the book of poetry discussed in the 227th and 228th sessions in Volume 5.</td><td>(这本新书的标题是《人类意识的扩展》[The Expansion of Human Consciousness]。不到一个小时，珍就写完它的大纲了，她还说成就此事的直觉过程与她的诗集之所以产生的那个过程很像，这在第五册第227和228节讨论过。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth now begins to elaborate on the Wyoming data given in the last session, in connection with my telepathic perception. See pages 53. 55.)</td><td>(赛斯现在开始详细阐述在上节课上给出的怀俄明州的资讯，以及我的心灵感应感知。见上节课相应页面。)</td></tr><tr><td>I told you that the group of people you saw were well developed psychically. They are not members of a nationally organized group however, but of a small group of five to seven. They were gathered informally when you perceived them.</td><td>我告诉过你，你看到的那群年轻人在心灵上发展得很好。然而，他们并不是一个全国性组织团体的成员，而是一个5到7人的小团体。当你感知他们时，他们是非正式的聚会。</td></tr><tr><td>They were not trying any experiments at the time, but their energies were free, and reaching outward. Often you are trying your psychic wings, so to speak, when you do not realize it. This is rather important.</td><td>当时他们并没有尝试做任何实验，但是他们的能量是自由的，并向外伸展。往往，在你没有发觉的时候，可以说你正在试用你的心灵翅膀。这相当重要。</td></tr><tr><td>What you call the astral body does much of its traveling when you are not consciously trying to experiment. Telepathically you receive thoughts when you are not trying to receive them. This does not mean that conscious experimentation will not work however. It simply means that what you are trying to do. consciously. you have been doing without knowing it all the while.</td><td>你所谓的灵体多半都是在你不是有意识地做实验时去旅行。透过心电感应，你在没有试图接收它们的时候，接收到想法。然而，这并不是说有意识的实验没有用。而只是说，你有意识地设法在做的事情，你在一无所知的情况下一直都在做。</td></tr><tr><td>I am still waiting for the day when you become aware of your own dreams while you are awake, and conscious at the same time, fully, of your physical environment, and able to operate normally at the same time in the physical universe.</td><td>我还在等那一天的到来，你们觉知你们自己的梦，但同时又是清醒的，充分意识到你们自己的物质环境，同时能够在物质宇宙中正常运作的那一天。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I suggest a brief break and we shall continue.</td><td>现在我建议短暂休息一下，我们再继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:55.  Jane said she was well dissociated.

At the time we did not have enough background material to see how this would be possible. We now believe it possible, and the closing paragraph above struck a chord within me; I think the very passive state I achieve at times after doing hatha yoga might signal a beginning here.</td><td>(很多节以前，我相信是在最早的50节之内，赛斯告诉我们，有一天我们应该会在对我们的梦有觉知的同时又完全是有意识的。当时我们没有足够的背景资料，所以不明白这怎么有可能。我们现在相信它是可能的，而且上文结尾那一段在我的内在里引起了共鸣；有时候我在做了哈他瑜珈[Hatha Yoga]之后会进入非常被动的状态，这里我认为那可能表示是一个开始。</td></tr><tr><td>(For while approaching the end of the exercise routine I am quite aware that I will be in an extremely relaxed mood, and that as I lay resting I can count on drifting into a state where dreams reveal themselves. This would include other related material like hypnagogic images, hearing voices, etc. My point is that I am usually aware that such passages are transpiring as I lay quietly; I am not asleep yet some of the material seems to be dreams. This is a long way from being fully and consciously active while such internal data is manifesting itself, but perhaps it is a beginning.</td><td>(在做完哈他瑜珈之后，我有时会达到这个状态，这可能标志着一个开始。因为就在即将做完练习的固定步骤时，我很清楚我会处于一种极度放松的心境，也觉察到躺着休息时，我肯定会进入梦自行显露的一种状态。这包括其他相关资料，像是入睡前的意象、听见声音等等在内。我的重点是说，对于这些在我静静地躺着时正在发生的经过，我通常是有知觉的；我没有睡着，但有些资料似乎是梦。这距离全然又有意识的主动，同时这种内在资料本身正自行显现的状态，还有很长的路要走，但也许是一个开始。</td></tr><tr><td>(The images, voices, dreams, etc., disappear when I deliberately bring myself back to the full waking state, but it might be interesting to see what I can do to prolong them through the use of suggestion. Perhaps I can carry them with me briefly as I get to my feet, etc.</td><td>(当我故意让自己回到完全清醒的状态时，意象、声音、梦等等就消失了，但是透过暗示的运用来看看我能做些什么来延长它们，可能会很有趣。也许当我站起来的时候，可以维持它们一阵子之类的。</td></tr><tr><td>(It was now time for the 52nd Dr. Instream experiment.

However this information, such as tonights will be most beneficial.</td><td>在下一节，我们会回来讨论我们的基本资料。不过像今晚这样的讯息会非常有帮助。</td></tr><tr><td>You have both been so consciously concerned with your Ouija board pointer that it is difficult for me now to get much information through. The conscious demands inhibit inner information. However give us a moment and we shall see what we can do, despite the difficulty.</td><td>你们两人在意识上都太过于关注灵应盘了，所以我现在不容易传太多资料过来。有意识的要求抵制内在讯息。但是，给我们一点时间，尽管有困难，我们还是会看我们能做些什么。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused and closed her eyes. Both of us had almost forgotten that we wanted Seth to help us locate the little three-legged pointer that goes with the Ouija board. Last weekend we had discovered the pointer was missing, and had been trying to find it ever since.</td><td>(珍暂停下来，闭上眼睛。我们俩几乎都忘记了，我们希望赛斯帮忙找到与灵应盘搭配的指针。上周末我们发现指针不见了，从那时起就一直设法找到它。</td></tr><tr><td>(We haven’t used the Ouija board for perhaps two years. It will be recalled that the board helped these sessions get under way, in December 1963, but it was soon dispensed with when Jane began to speak the material. The pointer's loss however was quite embarrassing because the board did not belong to us, but to our landlord, James Spaziani. We never did get around to buying our own.</td><td>(我们大概两年没有使用灵应盘了。还记得1963年12月在灵应盘的协助下，这些课于焉展开，但是当珍开始口述这些时，很快就不用灵应盘了。但是指针的遗失令人非常尴尬，因为灵应盘不是我们的，而是我们的房东詹姆斯·史帕日尼的。我们从来不曾抽出时间去购买我们自己的灵应盘。</td></tr><tr><td>(When we discovered the pointer was lost, I remarked to Jane that now Jimmy would probably want the board back. Two days later, Jimmy visited us and asked us if he could take the board back; he and his wife wanted to experiment with it. they had never used it after Jimmy bought it. Jimmy now told us it had been on his mind in recent days. Jane and I looked for the pointer again while Jimmy waited. We didn't find it and all three of us ended up embarrassed. Jane and I decided it was time to ask Seth for help.)</td><td>(当我们发现指针不见了，我跟珍说，现在吉米可能会想要回灵应盘。两天后，吉米拜访了我们，问我们可不可以把灵应盘还给他；他和他的妻子想要用它做实验。吉米买了灵应盘之后，他们从未使用过它。吉米此时告诉我们，最近几天他心里一直想着这件事。在吉米等待的时候，珍和我再次寻找指针。我们没有找到它，最后我们3个人都觉得很尴尬。珍和我决定是向赛斯求助的时候了。)</td></tr><tr><td>Low. A connection with magazines or papers. An earlier connection with the top of your filing cabinet, Joseph. I believe that it is in a dark rather than bright place. I suggest that you try your back porch.

We used to keep it on a low bookcase shelf; we used to keep newspapers on the same shelf also. We tie the papers in bundles and put them on an outside back porch for collection. Jane searched the papers there but didn’t find the pointer. But collections have been made recently and the pointer, if there, could be gone easily enough by now.)</td><td>(截至4月2日星期六，我在为这一节打字时，我们还没有找到指针。我们曾经把它放在一个低的书架上；我们过去也常常把报纸放在同一个架子上。我们将报纸成捆绑好，放在外面的后门廊以便回收。珍搜寻了那里的报纸，但没有找到指针。不过，最近报纸已经被收走了，指针[如果有的话]现在很可能也消失了。)</td></tr><tr><td>I will answer any questions that you have, personal or otherwise, or you may end the session as you prefer.</td><td>我会回答你的任何问题，无论是个人还是其他问题都可以，或者你比较想要的话，也可以结束这一节。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Sometime soon we’d like you to discuss the quasars, but we haven’t got the time now.”</td><td>(“我们希望你在不久之后讨论一下类星体，但我们现在没有时间。”)</td></tr><tr><td>(Recently several magazines and newspapers have printed articles on the newly-discovered quasars, or quasi-stellar radio sources.

It was attended only by Jane, myself and Marian Spaziani, the wife of our landlord, although others were present in the house.</td><td>(这一节是自发的，完全不在计划中。一个不同寻常的特点是，一整节下来，珍都用很小的声音或耳语讲话。课在凌晨1:30结束。这一节发生在我们3人花了一些时间讨论玛丽安最近一个生动的梦，以及第234节描述过的心电感应经历。见第五册。</td></tr><tr><td>(The session was entirely unplanned and spontaneous. An unusual feature was that Jane spoke in either a very low voice or a whisper for the whole session. It ended at 1:30 AM. The session came about after the three of us had spent some time discussing a recent vivid dream of Marians, and her telepathic adventure described in the 234th session. See Volume 5.</td><td>(玛丽安和吉米从这些课一开始就已经知道；事实上我们就是用他们的灵应盘开始做实验的。他们读过一些早期的资料，但从未上过课。玛丽安坦率地说，这个想法让她“惊慌”，所以我们没有坚持，也很少提到这份资料，除非她自己谈起这个主题。赛斯说过，玛丽安和吉米两人都拥有尚未开发的强大能力。</td></tr><tr><td>(Marian and Jimmy have known about the sessions since they began; indeed it was with their Ouija board that we began to experiment. They have read some of the early material but never attended a session. Marian said frankly that the idea made her “scary” so we did not insist, and rarely mentioned this material unless she brought up the subject herself Seth has said both Marian and Jimmy possess strong undeveloped abilities.</td><td>(星期六晚上，我们3个人坐在起居室里讨论玛丽安最近的梦，她认为这可能预示她自己的死亡。玛丽安现年50岁，在6月必须接受手术，切除被诊断为良性的卵巢肿瘤。她一直担心手术，后来珍和我得知，这让她比以前更乐于接受一节课。</td></tr><tr><td>(Saturday evening the three of us sat in the living room discussing Marians recent dream, which she thought might presage her own death. Marian is 50, and in June must undergo an operation to remove an ovarian tumor which has been diagnosed as benign. She has been worrying about the operation, and later Jane and I learned that this made her more receptive to a session than she had been previously.</td><td>(在我们谈了一段时间之后，珍告诉我，她觉得赛斯“飞过来又飞过去”，还说如果玛丽安愿意听的话，他可以向她解释她的梦。我们向她解释没有什么好惊慌的，之后玛丽安就同意了，这让我们感到惊讶。珍说，否则她宁愿离开；不让赛斯说话对她来说不是问题，但她觉得如果不上课的话，改变一下她的环境会比较好。</td></tr><tr><td>(After we had talked for some time Jane told me that she felt Seth “buzzing around,” and that he could explain Marians dream to her should she be willing to listen. Marian surprised us by agreeing, after we had explained to her that there was nothing to be alarmed about. Otherwise, Jane said, she would prefer to leave; she had no trouble keeping Seth from speaking, yet felt it would be better to change her surroundings should no session be held. (Marian has five children and they were all home. Her husband was at work and did not get home until after the session. The living room can be closed off by old-fashioned glass doors, so we closed those and had relative privacy even though the children passed back and forth on the other side. We could also hear the TV set faintly. The children did not know the session was taking place; from their viewpoints we must have appeared like three adults who sat talking, and closed the doors because they didn’t want to be bothered.</td><td>(玛丽安有5个孩子，他们都在家。她的丈夫在工作，一直到课结束后才回家。起居室可以用老式的玻璃门隔离起来，所以我们就把玻璃门都关上，即使孩子们在另一边来回走动，也有相对的隐私。我们也隐约听得到电视机的声音。孩子们不知道课正在进行；从他们的观点看来，我们看起来一定像是3个坐着说话的成年人，因为他们不想被打扰而关上了门。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth reassured Marian that should a child enter the room unexpectedly Ruburt would instantly “be himself," and nothing would be noticed by the child. No interruptions took place however. Seth began to speak in a loud whisper or a very soft voice, however one chooses to define it, and maintained this aspect throughout the evening, with frequent breaks. I have not heard him speak in this manner before. Jane's eyes opened at times, and she smoked an occasional cigarette. We had had a couple of drinks apiece before the session began and the atmosphere was warm and easy. I suppose that the session being held in her own home added to Marian's confidence, and at first break she said she was “fascinated.”</td><td>(赛斯向玛丽安保证，如果一个孩子意外地进入房间，鲁柏会立刻“是他自己”，孩子不会注意到任何事情。不过，没有发生任何中断。赛斯开始响亮的耳语，或非常柔和的声音说话，看你选择怎样定义它，而且他今晚从头到尾都是这个样子，期间经常休息。我以前没有听过他这样说话。珍的眼睛有时睁开，而且她偶尔抽烟。在这一节开始之前，我们每人都喝了几杯，气氛温暖又舒适。我想这一节在玛丽安自己的家里举行，让玛丽安比较有信心，所以在第一次休息时，她说她“为之神迷”。</td></tr><tr><td>(The session was a long one and will not be described in detail here, except for a couple of points I would note for possible future reference. It dealt only with personal material regarding Marian and her family, with some reincarnational data added.</td><td>(这一节的时间很长，所以这里就不详述了，除了有一两个重点我会记下来，以备将来参考以外。它只处理了玛丽安及其家人的私人资料，加上一些转世的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth reassured Marian about the dream involving her dead mother, explaining how it was a case of Marian projecting her own subconscious fears, among other things. Marians concern over her approaching operation entered in here, and Seth used this concern to make his main points of the evening. Marian loves children deeply. Seth explained that the ovarian tumor represented her subconscious attempt to grow something, since she has now almost gone through menopause and cannot grow children. Seth stressed that if Marian could learn to channel her energies outward, perhaps in helping underprivileged children, the subconscious need to be wanted would be satisfied and the tumor would shrink by itself.</td><td>(赛斯安慰玛丽安不用担心她这个涉及她亡母的梦，她解释这是玛丽安投射了自己在潜意识里的恐惧等等。玛丽安对于即将动手术的担忧进入了这里，赛斯用这个担忧来表达他今晚的要点。玛丽安深爱孩子们。赛斯解释说，卵巢肿瘤代表她在潜意识里试图培育某个东西，因为她现在几乎接近停经，不能生儿育女了。赛斯强调，如果玛丽安能够学会把她的能量导向外在，也许投注在帮助贫困儿童上，那么，这个被人需要的潜意识需求就会得到满足，肿瘤就会自行缩小。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth said he did not know whether Marian could learn rapidly enough how to do this; but if she could get herself on the right track soon, he said, she would not need the operation in June; a medical examination then would show that the tumor was shrinking, and would continue to shrink. Since Marian is a deeply religious person also, Seth tied his ideas on positive thinking and suggestion in with the religious theme, stressing the positive use of faith. He went to considerable length in all of this, repeating himself often in an effort to teach Marian as much as possible.</td><td>(赛斯说，他不知道玛丽安能不能快速学会做到这一点；但她说，如果她能够尽快走上正轨，那她就不需要在6月动手术；然后医学检查就会证明肿瘤正在缩小，并且会继续缩小。因为玛丽安是一个宗教信仰非常虔诚的人，所以赛斯也把他对正面思考和暗示的想法，与宗教主题结合在一起，强调信仰的正面用法。他在以上每方面都花了相当长的时间，经常重复自己说过的话，努力尽可能教会玛丽安。</td></tr><tr><td>(Should she not be able to master the use of suggestion and positive religious faith quickly enough, Seth reassured Marian that the operation would then take care of the tumor, and that Marian had no worries here. Seth also included suggestions for Marian regarding therapeutic dreams; at breaks Jane and I explained what we could, but left feeling there was much we didn't have time to include. The last part of the session involved reincarnational data. According to Seth two of the Spaziani children are psychically older than their parents. There has been much complicated switching of roles and sex among the family members. Marian herself has been twice a male and twice a female. The last time she was a female she was childless; Seth stressed quite often that this subconscious memory had much to do with her strong desire for children in this life.)</td><td>(赛斯向玛丽安保证，如果她不能快速熟练暗示和下面宗教信仰的用法，那么手术将会照顾肿瘤，这方面玛丽安不用担心。赛斯也提到给玛丽安的疗愈梦暗示；在休息时，珍和我可能详加解释，但是离开时感觉有很多我们没有时间讲到。这一节的最后一部分和转世资料有关。据赛斯说，史帕日尼家的两个孩子在心灵上比他们的父母年长。在家庭成员间，有很多复杂的角色和性别转换。玛丽安本人曾经有两世是男性，两世是女性。在她是女性的上一世，她没有孩子；赛斯经常强调这辈子强烈渴望生儿育女，和这种潜意识的记忆有很大的关系。)</td></tr><tr><td>(Tracing of the envelope flap used as the object in the 45th envelope experiment, in the 248th session for April 4,1966.)</td><td>在1966年4月4日第248节的第45节信封实验用作标的物的信封盖口描摹图</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 248</td><td>第248节 行动 信封45</td></tr><tr><td>APRIL 4, 1966 9 PM MONDAY AS SCHEDULED</td><td>1966年4月4日 星期一 晚上9点 定期课</td></tr><tr><td>(The 45th envelope experiment was held during the session.

The tracing is drawn with the same blue pen, my own, that was used to write on the object. The object came into being when Doug, who is 14 years old, was showing me how he writes left-handed. We sat on the couch and used a folded newspaper for a support; this was not steady. I did not intend to use this object for the envelope experiment, but decided to on the spur of the moment after it was made. Jane never saw the object in its finished form before the experiment.</td><td>(第45次信封实验在课间举行。见上面的描摹图。物件是我的侄子道格拉斯·柏兹[Douglas Butts)]和我自己在4月3日上个礼拜天于宾州塞尔市我父母家中写的一封信的盖口。描摹图是用写在这个物件上的同一蓝笔来描摹的，笔是我自己的。当14岁的道格让我看他如何用左手书写时，这个物件就产生了。我们坐在那里沙发上，用一张折叠的报纸支撑着；这不稳定。我当时并没有打算要用这个物件进行信封实验，而是在它制作完成之后一时心血来潮决定的。珍后来没有看过这个物件完成后的样子。</td></tr><tr><td>(She had seen the envelope from which the flap was torn however, in a casual way. The envelope enclosed a letter from Doug’s recently married sister Linda, who now lives in Brooklyn, NY. Both Jane and I read the letter yesterday; it was written to my parents. I wondered whether Seth would pick up any impressions connected with Linda, but he confined himself to impressions that originated yesterday as far as Jane and I were concerned. The N and Norcross indicated in pencil on the tracing signifies a blind embossed trademark on the envelope flap, but Seth said nothing about this either.</td><td>(不过，她碰巧看过盖口被撕开的信封。这个信封附有道格最近新婚的姐姐琳达写来的一封信，她现在住在纽约布鲁克林。珍和我昨天都读了这封信；信是写给我父母的。我想知道赛斯会不会接收到任何与琳达有关的印象，但在珍和我看来，他把自己局限在昨天产生的印象。在描摹图上用铅笔写出的“N”和“Norcross”[诺克罗斯]是指信封盖口上的一个盲浮雕商标，但赛斯对此也没有说什么。</td></tr><tr><td>( I sealed the object as usual in the regular double envelopes after enclosing it between two pieces of Bristol.</td><td>(我把物件放在两块纸板之间，然后照惯例把它密封在普通双开信封里。</td></tr><tr><td>(After supper this evening young Don Wilbur informed us that he and his wife would not be able to witness the session as scheduled. The Wilburs are discussed in the 246th session. Don left a sealed envelope, prepared to my instructions, with me, but I did not plan to use it for this evenings experiment. Jane knows of the envelope but did not see it. She requested that we not talk about it very much so that she wouldn't focus upon it to any degree.</td><td>(今晚吃完晚饭后，年轻的唐·韦伯告诉我们，他和他的太太无法按照计划来见证这一节。在第246节讨论过韦伯夫妇。唐留下一个密封的信封，那是按照我的指示和我一起准备的，但是我不打算在今晚的实验使用它。珍知道这个信封，但没有看到它。她要求我们少谈论它，以免她在任何程度上聚焦于这个信封。</td></tr><tr><td>(After several sessions involving various kinds of personal material we hoped to get back to the theoretical kind. The session was held in our living room as usual. Jane began speaking with her eyes closed and at a rather slow pace. She was not smoking.)</td><td>(在举行几节和私人资料有关的课之后，我们希望回到理论。这一节一如往常在我们的客厅举行。珍闭着眼睛开始讲话，速度相当缓慢。她没有抽烟。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>By now it should be obvious to you that you perceive only a small portion of reality; indeed, that your idea of reality is formed and limited by your perceptions.</td><td>到此时为止，你应该明白，你只能感知一小部分实相；事实上，你的观感形成并且限制了你的实相观念。</td></tr><tr><td>As you dig deeper into yourself you will find hints of other realities. Yours is not the only system that exists within what you would call the same space as the physical universe. You simply do not perceive these other systems. It is not space or time that divides one system from another. Habits of perception divide them however.</td><td>在你深入挖掘自己之际，你会发现其他实相的蛛丝马迹。在你们称之为物质宇宙的同一个空间内，你们的系统并不是唯一存在的系统。你们根本没有感知到这些其他的系统。区隔一个系统与另一个系统时，并不是空间或时间。然而，感知习惯却将它们一分为二。</td></tr><tr><td>The same atoms and molecules that are perceived in your system as physical objects are perceived in other systems as entirely different realities. Basically the same energy that composes a system projects into other systems, and it is perceived differently. Space, time, size, density, all of these are the results of your own perception.</td><td>在你们的系统中被感知为实物的相同原子和分子，在其他系统中被感知为完全不同的实相。基本上，构成一个系统的能量投射到其他系统内，而且被感知的样貌也不同。空间、时间、大小、密度，所有这些都是你自己的感知结果。</td></tr><tr><td>They have little to do with the nature of basic reality. Distance has nothing to do with space. Realities that you can only perceive in terms of light can, for example, exist as sound, as motion, as color, and can have dimensions with which you are completely unfamiliar. We will end up talking about your quasars, but first we need introductory material.</td><td>它们和基本实相的本质关系不大。距离和空间一点关联都没有。例如，就光线而言，你唯一可以感知的实相能够以声音、动态、颜色的形式存在，也能够具有你完全不熟悉的维度。我们最后会讨论你们的类星体，但首先我们需要讲讲介绍性质的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(In the 246th session I remarked that we’d like Seth to discuss the remarkable quasars, or quasi-stellar radio sources, that have caused so much discussion in astronomical circles lately. They violate the known laws of physics; although at the limits of our observable universe they are much too bright, and their energy is much too fantastic.)</td><td>(在第246节，我评论说，我们希望赛斯讨论值得注意的类星体或准恒星无线电源，它们最近在天文界引起诸多讨论。它们违反了已知的物理定律；然而在我们可观察到的宇宙极限下，它们太明亮了，而且能量强大到惊人。)</td></tr><tr><td>It is natural of course that you interpret projections from other realities into your own, according to the laws and limitations that seem to apply to your own system. You cannot however understand much concerning even the basic structure of your own universe unless you make some attempt, at least in imagination, to project yourselves beyond it.</td><td>当然，根据似乎适用于你们自身系统的法则和限制，来解释其他实相的投射，是一件自然的事。但是，除非你们至少在想像中做出一些尝试，不然的话，就算是你们自己宇宙的基本结构，你们都没办法了解到什么。</td></tr><tr><td>You cannot now do this physically, but you can do this through the use of the inner senses, trance states, hypnosis experiences, and intelligent use of the intuitions and imaginative powers. The universe is transparent to the inner senses. It is transparent functionally. It exists electromagnetically. All realities within it exist in their own band of intensity.</td><td>你们此时在物质上做不到这一点，但你们可以运用内在感官、出神状态、催眠经验，以及明智地利用直觉和想像力来做到这一点。宇宙对内在感官来说是透明的。在功能上，它是透明的。在电磁学上，它是存在的。在它之内的所有实相都存在于它们自己的强度范围内。</td></tr><tr><td>Past, present, and future, as you know, exist at once in the spacious present. We have been speaking in terms of the personal past, present and future, as it exists for the individual. Let us now consider the spacious present in different terms. What does it mean as applied to the question of the origins of your universe, and those events which you consider historical?</td><td>如你所知，过去、现在和未来同时存在于广阔的现在。我们一直在谈的是，对个体来说存在的个人过去、现在和未来。现在让我们以不同的角度思考广阔的现在。把它套用在你们的宇宙起源这个问题，以及那些你们认为具有历史意义的事件上，它是什么意思?</td></tr><tr><td>What about the cycles of history? You spoke of these I believe a few days ago. What about the spacious present and your quasars? What about your spacious present and the predictions, for example, of Nostradamus? What about the spacious present and its connection with evolution? All of these questions follow naturally, and should be here answered.</td><td>历史周期怎么样？我相信你几天前说过这些。广阔的现在和你们的类星体怎么样？你们那广阔的现在和比方说，诺斯特拉达姆士(Nostradamus)的预言怎么样？广阔的现在以及它与进化的关联怎么样？所有这些问题都是自然而然出现的，应该在这里得到解答。(编注：诺斯特拉达姆士，法国占星家，1503－1566年，诺斯特拉达姆士是21世纪最令人难忘的名字，实际上诺斯特拉达姆士是一位职业药剂师，相当于现代药剂师，同时，他还研究占星术并书写了大量的预言。1555年他出版了第一本书《预言》，现今仍大量印刷发布。当他30多岁时，他开始对巫术感兴趣，旅行至意大利、希腊和土尔其进行学习，所研究的巫术最终指引他的预言的诞生。1550年，他出版发行了第一本书，这是一本预言年鉴，其中包含了最早期的预言先知。)</td></tr><tr><td>We must therefore apply the principles of which I have spoken outward from the individual to the environment and the historical sequence which he has himself formed. This will involve us in a large task, and yet a necessary one.</td><td>因此，我们必须把我所说的原则从个人向外应用在环境和他自己形成的历史顺序上。这会赋予我们一个大任务，而且是一个必要的任务。</td></tr><tr><td>Those principles which I gave you as applying to the individual must obviously apply to nations and to peoples. Therefore if the individual can change his own past, then it must follow that a people can change its past, that a nation can change past events, that the future can influence the past historically, and even you see that a death can alter a birth.</td><td>我给你的那些应用于个人的原则显然必定适用于国家和民族。因此，如果个人可以改变他自己的过去，那么以此类推，一个民族能够改变它的过去，一个国家能够改变过去的事件，未来能够在历史上影响过去，甚至你知道死亡也能够改变一次出生。</td></tr><tr><td>Actions, even historic actions, within your system, have their reality you see in other systems also, though they will be perceived in quite a different manner. Remember some of the main points I gave you on probabilities. You see, in some dimension Napoleon conquered Europe completely, and the actions resulting from that probability continue in that dimension.</td><td>行动，甚至是历史上的行动，在你们的系统之内，都有你知道在其他系统中的实相，尽管它们会以完全不同的方式被感知。记得我给过你一些关于可能性的要点，你看，在某个维度里，拿破仑完全征服了欧洲，并且由这种可能性产生的行动在那个维度里继续存在。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a brief break and we shall continue.</td><td>我建议短暂休息一下，我们再继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:30. Jane was dissociated as usual. Her pace had continued to be broken by pauses, some of them long. Her eyes had begun to open occasionally toward the end of the delivery and she had sipped wine.</td><td>(9:30休息。珍像往常一样出离。她的步调继续被停顿打断，其中一些时间很长，在传述接近尾声之前，她开始偶尔睁开眼睛，她也喝了酒。</td></tr><tr><td>(She resumed in a somewhat more active manner at 9:43.)</td><td>(9:43分，她以更活泼的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Psychic energy is the one reality from which all others spring. The outer environment is a reflection of the inner environment.</td><td>现在。心灵能量是所有其他实相从中涌现的那一个实相。外在环境是内在环境的倒影。</td></tr><tr><td>When it is realized that man actually constructs his own physical universe, and that individual man constructs his own physical image, then you see considerable progress can be made. It goes without saying that the inhabitants of these other probable systems are every much as real as the inhabitants of your own system.</td><td>一旦意识到人其实建构了他自己的物质宇宙，而且那个人建构了他自己的物质形象时，你就会看到相当大的进步是可以取得的。不用说，这些其他可能系统的居民与你们自己的系统居民一样真实。</td></tr><tr><td>They would consider your own system as a probable universe. They dream as you dream. They utilize atoms and molecules as you do. The systems are divided, but not separated by space or time. They coexist but they cannot meet naturally, as the negative universe coexists with your own but is divided from it.</td><td>他们会认为你们自己的系统是一个可能的宇宙。你们会做梦，他们也会做梦。你们利用原子和分子，他们也是。系统是分开的，但不是被空间或时间分开。它们共存但却不能自然相遇，正如负宇宙与你们自己的宇宙共存，但却与它分开。</td></tr><tr><td>Now the spacious present obviously contains all of these systems, and these systems are all open systems, for the energy that composes them is the same. They appear to be closed systems, and we shall go more deeply into this particular matter upon another occasion.</td><td>现在，广阔的现在显然也包含所有这些系统，这些系统全部都是开放的系统，因为组成它们的能量是相同的。它们看起来是封闭的系统，我们改天会深入讨论这一个问题。</td></tr><tr><td>You must remember the material I gave you concerning moment points, and the nature of action. All of that material you see applies here. Again, you merely perceive a small portion of any given action, and when you cease to perceive it then it seems to you that the action itself ceases, and so an artificial boundary is erected.</td><td>你一定记得我给你的那份有关片刻点和行动本质的资料。你知道那一份资料在这里全部都适用。再一次，你只是感知任何既定行动的一小部分，当你不再感知它的时候，对你来说行动本身似乎就停止了，所以人为的界限于焉树立。</td></tr><tr><td>It has not occurred to you, you see, to attempt to look over this boundary, so to speak, because you have taken it for granted that nothing exists on the other side. I am not here speaking necessarily of death, though this is the obvious instance of course. I am speaking of something much more subtle. I am speaking of any small, seemingly insignificant action that you perform during an ordinary day, and here we are coming close.</td><td>你看，你没有想到要试着去查看这个界限的另一边，可以这么说，因为你已经理所当然地认为另一边没有任何东西存在。我在这里说的不一定是死亡，虽然这当然是明显的例子。我说的是某个更微妙的东西。我说的是你在平常的一天当中采取的任何小小的、看似微不足道的行动，而在这里我们近似于此。</td></tr><tr><td>You perceive only the most initial elements of such an action. It is as if you threw a ball, and could only follow the ball three inches away in space—then the ball would seem to vanish to you. The action would therefore seem completed. You would think it idiotic to image what happened to the ball when you could see it no longer, for habit would work in such a way that the disappearance of the ball would seem natural and normal, and a part of the nature of things.</td><td>你只能感知这样一个行动最初的元素。就好像你扔出一颗球，只能在空间里跟着这颗球三英寸远一样——然后这颗球对你来说似乎就消失了。因此，这个行动似乎已经完成。当你再也看不到它时，你会认为想像球会发生什么事似乎很愚蠢，因为习惯会以这样的方式运作，而让球的消失看似自然又正常，而且是事物本质的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>So, comparing the ball to an action, you perceive but the smallest portion of any given action, even one performed by yourself. It does not occur to you that there is more to perceive. When the ball goes out of sight, so to speak, you could say for our analogy that it goes into the future.</td><td>因此，把球比作是一个动作，你感知的只是任何既定动作最小的部分，即使是由你自己执行的行动也一样。你不会想到还有更多的东西可以感知。这么说吧，当球离开视线时，你可以说我们的比喻是，它进入未来。</td></tr><tr><td>This would be true as an analogy if time were no more than a series of moments, or if the future were a definite but momentarily unperceived reality. When you throw this ball however it does not only go outward in one straight line thusly—</td><td>如果时间只不过是一连串的时刻，或者如果未来是一个明确但暂时未被感知的实相，那么这个比喻就是适用的。然而，当你扔出这颗球时，它不仅会这样向外直线移动——</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was speaking rapidly now and her eyes were opening at times. Now she thrust an arm straight out toward me.)</td><td>(珍现在说话速度很快，她的眼睛有时会睁开。现在她朝着我伸出一只手臂。)</td></tr><tr><td>—into this future. Although you see it as doing so, it goes out you see in all directions, thusly—</td><td>——进入这个未来。虽然你看到它这样做，但你知道它是向外延伸，进入所有的方向之内，因此——</td></tr><tr><td>(Again the gesture; this time Jane threw her arms wide.)</td><td>(再一次比出手势；这次，珍张开两只手臂。)</td></tr><tr><td>—in all probabilities, in all possible directions.</td><td>——也进入所有的可能性当中，进入所有可能的方向之内。</td></tr><tr><td>Not only are you blind beyond a certain arbitrary point, so that the straight line seems cut off and the action completed, but you are blind to all the other directions, you see, that our ball could and does take.</td><td>你不仅在某个任意的一点之外就看不见，以至于看起来直线被切断了，行动完成了，并且你对我们的球，你知道，可能确实采取的其他方向也全部都视而不见。</td></tr><tr><td>This is difficult to explain to you. As an exercise, occasionally catch yourself in some insignificant action—speaking, touching. If you speak for example be conscious of speaking and hearing yourself speak. Try to think of the words, or to experience them in terms of color. In terms of bulk, of density, of distance. Think of the beginnings of the simple act of which you are normally almost completely unaware, the muscular motions that must be made before one word can be uttered.</td><td>这很难向你解释。把它当作一个练习，偶尔当场觉察你自己正在某个微不足道的行动中——说话、触摸。例如，如果你说话，那就觉察你在说话，并且听着自己说话。试着想一下这些字词，或从颜色的角度来体验它们。从体积、密度、距离的角度。想想你通常几乎完全没有意识到的简单行为一开始是什么样子，那些在说出一个字之前必须做出的肌肉动作。</td></tr><tr><td>Catch yourself in a simple thought and try to experience the beginnings of that action. You will be led into action indeed in a completely new way. Then try to experience this simple action as it affects others, not only emotionally and physically in terms of the changes it elicits from their complicated structures, but also the new actions it requires of them.</td><td>当场觉察到你自己的一个简单念头，试着体验那个行动的开头。你就会以一种全新的方式开始行动。然后在这个简单的行动影响他人时试着体验它，不仅是它从它们的复杂结构中引出的变化，还包括它要求它们采取的新行动。</td></tr><tr><td>You will see what a mysterious, complicated and almost unbelievable ballet results from one simple thought or word from any seemingly uncomplicated action.</td><td>你会看到，从任何看似的行动产生的一个简单的念头或字词，其结果是一场神秘、复杂而且几乎令人难以置信的芭蕾舞。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take your break. But if it seems that we are far afield from the spacious present and quasars, then you are mistaken.</td><td>你可以休息一下。但是，如果看起来我们好像远离了广阔的现在和类星体，那你就错了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:09. Jane was more dissociated than she had been for her first delivery. Her pace had become much faster. Her eyes opened often toward the end of the delivery for whole sentences at a time. She spoke with many gestures and her voice was a bit stronger.</td><td>(10:09休息。比起她的第一段传述，珍更加出离。她的步调变得更快。她的眼睛经常在传述结束前睁开，一次持续到整句讲完为止。她比了很多手势而且她的声音也比较有力一点。</td></tr><tr><td>(It was now time for the 53rd Dr. Instream experiment. As usual Jane's pace now slowed down somewhat. She sat with her hands raised to her closed eyes. Resume at 10:15.)</td><td>(现在是进行第53次殷斯翠姆博士实验的时候了。像往常一样，珍的速度此时有点慢了下来。她坐着，举起双手，放在闭着的眼睛上。10:15继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, give us a moment.</td><td>现在，等我们一下。</td></tr><tr><td>Another formal affair. By this I do not refer to a ball, necessarily, but to a formally-scheduled event where formality rather than informality rules. We will give an object shortly.</td><td>另一场正式的活动。我这样讲不一定是指舞会，而是指一个正式安排的事件，讲究礼节而非不拘礼节。我们很快会讲出一个物件。</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps a connection with a charity and this affair. In any case funds from it do not go for profit. The affair is one that is held yearly, I believe—at least in the minds of those who attend there is the memory of previous such affairs, held for the same purpose, and approximately at the same time of the year.</td><td>也许是和慈善机构以及这件事有关联。无论如何，从它而来的资金不是被当作盈利。这个活动每年举行一次，我相信——至少在那些出席者的心智里，都有着以前为了同一个目的，大约在每年的同一个时间举行这种活动的记忆。</td></tr><tr><td>A luncheon for our friend today, of an established kind. Some distant connection here with a museum.</td><td>今天有一场为我们的朋友举办的午餐会。这里和一间博物馆有着相隔遥远的关联。</td></tr><tr><td>The object seems to be some kind of scarf. A connection with a four and six and with this scarf. It may belong to a woman. It has been on the back seat of a car. It is brown, with tinges of orange or red.</td><td>这个物件似乎是某种围巾。和一个4和一个6以及这条围巾有关联。它可能属于一个女人。它一直放在一辆车的后座上。它是咖啡色的，带有橙色或红色的色调。</td></tr><tr><td>An interlude that was not pleasant at approximately 3 PM this afternoon for our friend, and a letter or package that was difficult to open. This being separate and not connected with the unpleasant episode.</td><td>今天下午大约3点有一个对我们的朋友来说并不愉快的插曲，以及不容易打开的一封信或一个包裹。这是分开的，和不愉快的插曲无关。</td></tr><tr><td>It also seems as if he has recently been in a strange kitchen, speaking with a man. Tables and chairs here of modest wood. Perhaps the man works for Dr. Instream in some capacity. A handyman or janitor.</td><td>此外，看起来好像他最近在一个陌生的厨房待过，和一个男人说话。这里有中等木料做成的桌椅。也许这个男人以某种身分为殷斯翠姆博士工作。一个杂务或管理员。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have an envelope for me, Joseph?</td><td>约瑟，你有信封要给我吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes."</td><td>(“有。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused at 10:25 and I handed her the 45th sealed envelope.

The item belongs to, or did belong to, someone with musical interests. An instrument connected here I believe, perhaps indirectly.” Doug’s parents, Loren and Betts, have strong musical interests. As far as we know however Doug does not. Nor does his sister Linda, who wrote the letter and enclosed it in the envelope from which the flap used as object was taken. Neither Loren or Betts own any instruments except for a piano, which they both major in. Betts is choir director for her church. Would a piano or organ be the indirect connection! I did not think to ask.</td><td>(“和强烈的音乐兴趣有关联。这个物件属于或确实属于某个对音乐有兴趣的人。我相信这里和一种乐器有关联，也许是间接的关联。”道格的父母洛伦和贝兹对音乐的兴趣浓烈。但我们知道道格没有，他的妹妹琳达也没有，她写了这封信，把它装进信封，信封的盖口被用来当作实验物件。洛伦或贝兹都没有任何乐器，除了钢琴以外，他们都主修钢琴。贝兹在她的教会里当合唱团指挥。钢琴或风琴会不会是间接关联？我没想到要问。</td></tr><tr><td>(My second question concerned the child data.</td><td>(我的第二个问题和孩子资料有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>(“ I believe a male.” Doug, coauthor of the object, is male.</td><td>(“我相信是男性。”该物件的共同创作者道格是男性。</td></tr><tr><td>(My third question concerned the double exposure.</td><td>(我的第三个问题和双重曝光有关。</td></tr><tr><td>(“I am not clear here.

While in trance, she said, she had strong thoughts of Loren and Betts and the pictures, although she had no images. She also had no thoughts that she is aware of, of the viewer. When I asked her to explain the object, she explained, the inhibiting idea of the transparencies got in the way. Since Seth didn't want her to say transparencies, a compromise emerges in which a connection with the actual envelope object is given.</td><td>(珍此刻在休息时突然解释说，当我要求她说出这个物件的名称时，赛斯不想要她说透明底片。她说，在出神的时候，尽管没有意象，但她对洛伦和贝兹以及照片有着强烈的想法。对于灯箱，她也没有任何她有觉知的想法。当我要求她说明这个物件时，她解释说，抑止透敏感底片的意念造成阻碍。因为赛斯不想要她说透明底片，所以一个折中说法出现了，给出了与实际信封物件相关的一个连结。</td></tr><tr><td>(Remember that at the beginning of this data Jane is quoted as saying that she had strong impressions of something connected with both music and photographs. This before she opened the experimental envelope to see the object. Jane knows Loren and Betts well, of course, and the transparencies were of Jane and me. These emotional charges outweighed that contained in the envelope object.</td><td>(请记住，在这个资料的开始，引述了珍的话，她说她对某个与音乐和照片有关的东西有强烈的印象。这是在打开实验信封看到物件之前说的。当然，珍熟识洛伦和贝兹，而且底片拍的是珍和我。这些情感电荷超过了信封物件包含的情感电荷。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed at an average pace, with her eyes closed, at 10:48.)</td><td>(10:48分，珍以一般的速度继续，眼睛闭着。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will now end our session. The connections were clear enough to need no discussion.</td><td>我们现在要结束我们的课了。连结很清楚，不需要讨论。</td></tr><tr><td>The yellow however did not come through. This referred to the copper-colored buttons on the boy’s jacket, a new suit, I believe.</td><td>然而，黄色没有传过来。这是指男孩的外套，一件新的西装上的铜色纽扣，我相信。</td></tr><tr><td>(True. As soon as Seth explained the data I remembered that Doug explained to Jane and me that he was wearing a new suit. This was when he first arrived. The jacket has copper-colored buttons. Doug hung the coat up carefully after his arrival and we saw it no more that day.)</td><td>(真的。赛斯一解释这个资料，我就想起道格告诉过珍和我，他穿着一件新西装。这是在他刚到的时候说的。外套上有铜色纽扣。道格一来，就把他的外套小心翼翼挂好。那天我们就没再看到它了。)</td></tr><tr><td>If you have any questions, or if there is anything in particular you would like to discuss, we will continue.

Jimmy's question prompted my next query however.</td><td>(那一节在凌晨1:30结束时，玛丽安的丈夫吉米下班回家。玛丽安告诉他上课的事。吉米当时开口说出他想知道赛斯可不可以告诉他，在接下来的6个月内，他身上会发生什么“重大事件”。总之，那时候我们已经在喝咖啡了。赛斯并没有过来。然而吉米的问题促使我想到下一个问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(“What did Jimmy mean when he asked whether anything significant was going to happen to him within the next six months?”)</td><td>(“当吉米问在未来6个月内会不会发生任何重大事件时，吉米的意思是什么？”)</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment here.

Seth devoted much of the 229th session to what he said were tax and money problems involving Jimmy. As stated at the time, Jane and I have no idea as to the validity of the 229th session. The material was quite detailed; we have yet to hear or see anything to back any of it up. In a recent session Seth said that probabilities might enter in with this data, but that is all we know. Saturday night Jane and I did wonder why Jimmy asked the particular question he did. In the 229th session Seth gave a March 15 date in connection with Jimmy 's supposed tax troubles.)</td><td>(在第247节当中，赛斯告诉玛丽安，吉米的健康状况很好。赛斯把第229节大部分时间都用在他说吉米涉入的税务和金钱问题上。正如当时说的，珍和我完全不知道第229节的效力如何。资料很详细；我们还没有听到或看到任何印证它的事情。在最近的一节课里，赛斯说这份资料会讨论可能性，但我们知道的就这样而已。周六晚上，珍和我的确想知道吉米为什么会问他问的这个问题。在第229节，赛斯给了一个与吉米所谓的税务问题有关的3月15日的日期。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will close the session. Sometime in the future when you take a vacation from other concerns, we can hold several meetings a week, for perhaps two weeks. Not now, however; when you have the energy, both of you. This would be enjoyable and most beneficial from many standpoints. A crash course, I believe you call it. And now my best wishes to you both.</td><td>我们要结束这一节了。未来某个时候，在你们从其他事抽身休假时，我们可以每周举行几节课，为期也许两周的时间。不过，不是现在；当你们两个人都有能量的时候。从很多角度看来，这会很愉快也非常有益。速成课程，我相信你们是这么说的。而现在，我要给你们两位最好的祝福。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good night, Seth.”</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 11:00 PM.

See the tracing above. The object was a red satin bow that had been kicking around the studio for some months; at various times I had idly thought of using it for an experiment. I did not think Jane had noticed it particularly, and she confirmed this after the session.</td><td>(第46次信封实验在课间进行。见上图。标的物是一个红色丝缎蝴蝶结，在工作室四周被放过来拿过去好几个月；在不同的时间点，我曾经不经心地想过要用它做实验。我认为珍并没有特别注意到它，而在这一节结束之后，她也证实了这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>( I remembered very little about the bow, yet subjectively I was sure it had been taken from a greeting card of some kind. I work for a greeting card company, but did not remember seeing other ribbons like it there in particular. I did not recall the card the ribbon came from, nor why I had removed it—if I was the one who had done so. I hoped Seth could fill us in on the details. The bow was in poor condition, and I assumed I had carried it home in a coat pocket sometime last winter.</td><td>(关于蝴蝶结，我记得的事情很少，但主观上我确定它是从某种贺卡上取下来的。我在一家贺卡公司工作，但不记得在哪里有特别看过其他和它一样的缎带。我记不得这个缎带来自哪张卡片，也不知道为什么我要把它取下来——如果我是做这件事的人。我希望赛斯能够提供我们细节。蝴蝶结的状况很差，而且我以为是去年冬天的某个时候，我把它放进大衣口袋里带回家的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Since the object had been thoroughly flattened by some kind of pressure, it was no trick to place it between the usual two pieces of heavy Bristol, then seal it in double envelopes.</td><td>(由于物件已被某种压力彻底压扁，所以把它放在平常的两块厚纸板之间是轻而易举的事，之后再放进双开信封里密封起来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane did not feel very well before the session, but when I mentioned calling the session off she insisted on holding it.

Your perceptions, your physical perceptions, cut a good bit of the portion that you could receive into bits and pieces. Since you do not perceive whole action that occurs within your own system, you do not understand it. So it should not surprise you that you misinterpret projections of other actions from different systems, when they appear as they sometimes do within your own.</td><td>你在意识上感知这类行动的某些部分，有些是在潜意识，有些是用内在感官，但是你没有感知整个行动。你的感知，你的肉体感知，把一大块你可以接收到的部分切割成零星碎片。由于你没有感知在你们自己的系统之内发生的整个行动，因此你无法理解它。所以出自不同系统的其他行动产生的投射有时候会出现在你们自己的系统之内，而当它们出现时，你们错误解读了它们，这应该不会让你觉得讶异吧。</td></tr><tr><td>When actions from other systems are projected into your own, your own perceptions distort the true nature of the event. To begin with then, you attempt to understand an action that is poorly perceived. You project upon it your own concepts of space and time, and try to interpret the action in their light.</td><td>当其他系统的行动被投射到你们自己的系统时，你们自己的感知会扭曲事件的真实本质。首先，你试图了解一个被感知不足的动作。你把你自己的空间和时间观念投射在它身上，尝试从它们的角度解读这个运行。</td></tr><tr><td>This is certainly the case with the quasars. Until an intuitive insight strikes, the quasars will not be understood.</td><td>类星体当然就是这种情况。在直观的洞察力出现之前，是不可能了解类星体的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's pace was faster now, and her eyes had begun to open as she sipped some wine occasionally. If she was tired she gave no indication. I felt it was going to be one of those sessions where she became really involved with the material.</td><td>(珍的速度现在变快了，在她偶尔啜饮一些葡萄酒时，她的眼睛开始睁开。如果她累了，她倒是没有露出半点端倪。我觉得这会是她真得全神投入资料之中的其中一节课。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth began talking about quasars and related background material in the last session. That material in turn resulted from a question I asked, or a comment I made, in the 246th session. Once again, quasars are quasi-stellar radio sources, presumably at the farthest reaches of our observable universe according to our instruments. They contradict our laws of physics, being many times too bright for their size and distance, and emitting much too much energy. See the article on them in Time Magazine for March 11,1966.)</td><td>(赛斯在上一次课上开始谈论类星体和相关背景资料。这些资料反过来是我在246节提出的一个问题或者我做出的评论。再一次，类星体是准恒星无线电荷，大概是在根据我们的仪器，距离我们可观察的宇宙很远的地方。它们与我们的物理定律相矛盾，而且它们的亮度高出它们的大小和距离很多倍，而且散发的能量也多了很多。见1966年3月11日《时代》杂志上的文章。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. They represent energy in a much more pure form than any with which you are acquainted in your system. This does not necessarily mean that such energy as that displayed by the quasars does not exist within your system. We shall discuss that later. But you are not acquainted with the existence of such energy.</td><td>现在。它们代表的是某种形式的能量，那种形式比你在你们的系统中熟悉的形式纯净多了。这不一定意味着类星体展现的这种能量不存在你们的系统之内。我们稍后会讨论那一点。而是说你们对这种能量的存在不熟悉。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Looking from your planet, outward as you think, at the quasars, your scientists believe that they look backward in space, in your terms. This is erroneous. It is true enough within the present framework of your knowledge, and the idea will work in the same wav that the cause and effect theory works, which is only up to a certain point.</td><td>现在。从你们的星球看出去，如你想像的那样向外看，在类星体上，你们的科学家相信，按照你们的说法，他们是在空间中向后看。这是错误的。在你们目前的知识架构内，这称得上是真的，而且这个概念的作用和因果理论的作用一样，只能达到某一点。</td></tr><tr><td>The idea will seem legitimate, and then suddenly it will fall apart. It will fall apart for a very simple reason, and for a more profound one.</td><td>这个概念看似于理有据，然后它就会突然解体。它会因为一个非常简单的原因，而且是一个更深刻的原因，而四分五裂。</td></tr><tr><td>The simple reason, so simple that it appears childlike, is this. If you can look backward from your planetary viewpoint with your physical instruments, and using your own terms and definitions, then from some point you see within the same framework, your scientists should be able to look forward, and they cannot.</td><td>这个简单的原因，简单到看起来像孩子似的。如果你们能够用你们的物质仪器从你们的行星观点向后看，并且使用你们自己的字眼和定义，那么你们就可以从同一个架构之内的某一点，你知道，你们的科学家就应该能够向前看，而他们却办不到。</td></tr><tr><td>That is the simple reason. The profound reason is as simple to say, but more difficult to understand. Using your terms again, and your scientific framework, when you look outward away from your planet, and when you assume that you are looking backward in time, you are simply looking into, or toward, what may be described for analogy’s sake, the center, or core, of an infinite sphere; which exists, you see, in your terms as far on the other side of the inner core, and in all directions. You cannot look away from it, for you are not on any outward edge or skin of it, from which to get such a viewpoint.</td><td>这是一个简单的原因。深刻的原因说起来一样简单，但了解起来却比较困难。再次使用你们的字眼和你们的科学架构，当你们从你们的星球向外看时，当你们认为你们正在时间中向后看时，你们只是看进或看向为了断断续续而可以描述成一个无限范围的中心或核心的东西；你看，按照你们的说法，它存在于内在核心的另一边之遥，也存在于所有的方向里。你们无法远观它，因为你们不是在它的任何外缘或外皮上，从那里获得这样的观点。</td></tr><tr><td>And time does not exist as a past, present and future in your terms. We will here get rather complicated, I’m afraid.</td><td>时间不是以你们所说的过去、现在和未来这种形式存在。恐怕，我们这里会变得相当复杂。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was now speaking rapidly and using many gestures. Her eyes were open much of the time and were very dark.)</td><td>(珍此时话说得很快，并且比了很多手势。她的眼睛大部分时间都是睁开的，而且颜色很深。)</td></tr><tr><td>Even in our discussions we use the terms past, present and future, but I have told you that your future can influence your past, and that the spacious present is the only time reality.</td><td>即使在我们的讨论中，我们也使用过去、现在和未来这些字眼，但我告诉过你，你的未来可以影响你的过去，广阔的现在是唯一的时间实相。</td></tr><tr><td>We will say what we have to say, and then clarify for you later as we go along. Now. To look backward into the past, speaking on my terms now and not yours, to look backward into the past entails looking forward into the future, and there is no firm ground, you see; there is no present in a basic manner, no firm ground that is the present, from which to view the future or the past. For they are all one, and you are a part of the spacious present.</td><td>我们会说出我们要说的话，然后一边进行一边为你理清疑点。现在。回顾过去，现在是按照我的说法，而不是你们的说法，回顾过去必需展望未来，而且你看，没有坚实的基础；没有基本的现在，没有现在这个坚实的基础，由此看到未来或过去。因为它们都是一体的，而你是广阔的现在所属的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>I will let you take a break and we shall continue as we are getting across some excellent ideas this evening.</td><td>我会让你休息一下, 我们再继续, 因为今天晚上正在阐明一些很好的概念。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27. Jane said she was really “out", or that Seth was really “in. ’’She was aware of nothing but the material while speaking, and felt the ideas were good.

She said she wouldn't have been surprised had Seth called off the session in the beginning.</td><td>(9:27休息。珍说她真的“出去了”，或者说赛斯真的“进来了”。她在说话的时候只对资料有觉知，感觉这些概念很好。到传述结束前，她的速度一直很快；她的眼睛大部分时候都是睁开的，而且颜色很深，她说话时语多强调，也比了很多手势。她现在感觉好多了。她说如果赛斯一开始就取消这一节，她不会觉得惊讶。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed at a somewhat slower rate. Her eyes were closed but she was smoking. 9:40.)</td><td>(9:40分。珍以稍微慢一点的速度继续。她的眼睛闭着，但她在抽烟。)</td></tr><tr><td>Let it be understood that for simplicity’s sake we have been dealing with analogies that can be understood by you. The fact is you see that we are speaking in terms of simplified dimensions, and of physical properties.</td><td>要了解，为了简单起见，我们一直在处理你能够理解的类比。事实上，你知道，我们是从简化的维度和物质属性的角度说话。</td></tr><tr><td>Now the quasars represent pure energy, basically speaking. Your scientists presently have little idea of what this means, for comparatively speaking they conceive of energy in one-dimensional terms. You know what antimatter is. You know what positive matter is. Both of these represent realities that you can understand rather easily.</td><td>现在，基本上，类星体代表纯粹的能量。对于这意味着什么，你们的科学家目前不太有概念，因为相对来说，他们是以单一维度的角度来设想能量。你知道反物质是什么。你知道正物质是什么。这两者代表了你很容易了解的实相。</td></tr><tr><td>(For some material on antimatter in particular see the 60. 63rd sessions.)</td><td>(有关反物质的一些资料，见第60至63节。)</td></tr><tr><td>They deal with the manipulation of atoms and molecules. With our quasars we are dealing with something else. We are dealing with energy that has no need of atoms and molecules, and no need of chemical reactions. We are dealing with energy that is instantly transformed into action without matter.</td><td>他们和原子与分子的操纵打交道。在我们的类星体上，我们正在和其他东西打交道。我们正在和不需要原子和分子，也不需要化学反应的能量打交道。我们正在和无需物质就能立即转化为行动的能量打交道。</td></tr><tr><td>It is electrical energy. Quasars are distributed, so to speak, throughout all realities—throughout all universes, in other words. They do not conform to the camouflage patterns within any system outside of their own. They are not suns, planets, galaxies or universes in those terms.</td><td>这是电能。可以说，类星体的分布遍及所有的实相——换句话说，遍及所有的宇宙。它们不遵照它们自己以外任何系统之内的伪装模式。它们不是按照那些说法所指的太阳、行星、星系或宇宙。</td></tr><tr><td>Their electrical intensity and mass cannot be explained by your physics.</td><td>你们的物理学无法解释它们的电力强度和质量。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane’s eyes had been opening again and her pace was speeding up. Now she put out her cigarette, took a sip of wine, and went into a pause lasting at least a minute.)</td><td>(珍的眼睛再一次睁开，她的速度加快了。现在她熄了烟，喝了一口酒，然后停顿了至少一分钟。)</td></tr><tr><td>Their influence is felt in every universe. Their diffused, or their energy diffused through all systems, powers all systems.</td><td>每个宇宙都能感受到它们的影响。它们扩散或它们的能量扩散到所有的系统，为所有系统提供动力。</td></tr><tr><td>There is no intelligent life within them in your terms. They are composed of endless intelligence. They are not matter, but in your terms they have been matter.</td><td>按照你们的说法，它们之内没有智能生物。它们是由无尽的智能构成的。它们不是物质，而按照你们的说法，它们曾经是物质。</td></tr><tr><td>They will not be explained by your science in anything like adequate terms. They represent what you would call an evolution of energy, so far advanced as to be unrecognizable as life to you.</td><td>你们的科学无法从充分的角度解释它们。它们代表了你们所谓的能量进化，发展之先进，就像生命一样，你们是认不出来的。</td></tr><tr><td>It is their energy that gives energy to your own, and all other universes, and it is their energy that forms the matter of your own physical universe. Yet these quasars represent the power of only a small portion of reality.</td><td>它们的能量为你们自己和其他所有宇宙提供能量，它们的能量形成你们自己物质世界的物质。然而，这些类星体只代表了一小部分实相的力量。</td></tr><tr><td>The trouble here is that even in our discussions we are to some extent limited by your own concepts, for you do not have words to express what I could say, you see.</td><td>这里的问题是，即使在我们的讨论中，我们某种程度受限于你们自己的概念，因为，你知道，你们没有字眼可以表达我能说的话。</td></tr><tr><td>I hope to be able to introduce concepts to Ruburt, but intuitively. These will then become also a property of his intellect, and help us put the words together that we need.</td><td>我希望能够把观念介绍给鲁柏，但是经由直觉。然后这些观念就会成为他智力的属性，帮助我们组合我们需要的字词。</td></tr><tr><td>The complexity is literally too much for your language. These quasars were not discovered earlier because your astronomers would not see them. T hat they see them now is a direct result of enlarged concept patterns on their part.</td><td>对你们的语言来说，复杂度真的是太高了。这些类星体之前没有被发现，因为你们的天文学家不会看到它们。他们现在看到的是他们的观念模式扩大之后产生的直接结果。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane and I had wondered about this. We had read that some of the quasars were found on old sky photographs.)</td><td>(珍和我也想过这件事。我们读到过，有些类星体是在旧空照上找到的。)</td></tr><tr><td>What they “see” (in quotes) is of course distorted. What they SSS has no physical mass however, but only electrical mass and intensity, which is a different thing.</td><td>他们“看到”(引号)的当然是扭曲的。然而，他们看到的东西没有物体质量，只有电的质量和强度，这不是同样的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, even the home skies about you are filled with other realities, as I have said often.

The object was a faded maple leaf that Jane and I had picked up, along with others, on a walk last year, probably in October 1965.  I subsequently made a watercolor drawing of this leaf and another. As will be seen the object led to some data that is somewhat difficult to evaluate, but Jane and I believe it legitimate.</td><td>1966年4月11日第250节第47次实验用作标的物的枫叶描摹图(第47次信封实验在课间举行，见上图的描摹图所示。标的物是一片褪了色的枫叶，去年，可能是在1965年10月，珍和我还有其他人一起去散步捡到的。我随后为这片叶子和另一片叶子做了一幅水彩画。接下来会看到，这个物件引出一些有点难以评估的资料，但珍和我认为它是合情合理的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Try as we would neither of us could recall just when we picked up this particular leaf, other than that it was in the early fall. I thought of October, then checked this with the pendulum, which for me is quite reliable. The pendulum agreed with my conscious answer. The location of just where I picked up this particular leaf is important in the data, and this we are sure of. This will be explained. Suffice it to say now that Jane and I will never cease to be surprised at the turns impressions attached to such experimental objects can take.</td><td>(尽管努力尝试，但我们都想不起来我们捡起这片叶子是什么时候，只记得是在初秋。我想到10月，然后用摆钟核对这件事，摆钟对我来说非常可靠。摆钟的结果和我有意识的答案是一致的。我捡到这片叶子的地点在资料中是很重要的，这一点我们确信不疑。这之后会解释。现在只需要说，对于附加在这类实验物件上的印象，其千变万化永远都会让珍和我惊讶不已。</td></tr><tr><td>(The session was held in the front room. Jane began speaking while sitting down and with her eyes closed. Her voice was average and she used many short pauses; between the pauses, oddly enough, her delivery was rather fast.)</td><td>(这一节在前面的房间举行。珍坐下来开始说话，眼睛闭着。她的声音普通而且她有很多次短暂地停顿；在停顿之间，很奇怪的是，传述相当快。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>("Good evening, Seth.”)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>It is impossible for you to perceive what these quasars represent. You can only perceive distorted projections of these quasars.</td><td>你们不可能感知这些类星体代表什么。你们只能感知这些类星体的扭曲投射。</td></tr><tr><td>Your interpretation must therefore be made scientifically, according to the laws with which you are familiar within your system. But these laws do not apply outside your system, and they certainly do not apply to your quasars.</td><td>因此，根据你们在自己系统之内熟悉的法则，你们的解读必须合乎科学。但是这些法则不适用于你们的系统之外，当然也不适用于你们的类星体。</td></tr><tr><td>What your scientists are perceiving is the form, the camouflage form, which the projections of the quasars take within your system.</td><td>你们的科学家所感知的都是形式，伪装形式，那是类星体在你们系统之内的投射。</td></tr><tr><td>It is of course because of your highly distorted ideas of time that you persist in projecting antiquated concepts of past, present and future outward into explorations of your universe. While the quasars appear to be filled with more energy than man can conceive of, still the quasars that are now perceived are but shadows of the reality behind them.</td><td>这当然是因为你们的时间观念极度扭曲，你们坚持把过去、现在和未来的过时概念向外投射在探索你们的宇宙之中。类星体看似充满了能量，多过人类所能设想的程度，但现在被感知到的类星体仍然只是它们背后那个实相的阴影而已。</td></tr><tr><td>It is only because you are so hypnotized with ideas of beginning and endings that you persist in searching for them in the universe, and you distort data that would otherwise be clear to you. I have told you that the universe expands in a way that has nothing to do with space. But when you try to relate this idea to the universe as you know it, you find yourself up against a brick wall, for what you seem to see out in the universe is indeed space.</td><td>只是因为你们被开始和结束的观念催眠了，所以坚持在宇宙中搜寻它们，而扭曲了对你们来说本来清楚可见的资料。我告诉过你，宇宙以一种与空间无关的方式扩展。但是，当你们试图把这个概念与你们所知的宇宙连结在一起时，你们会发现自己正对着一面砖墙，因为你们在宇宙中好像看到的其实是空间。</td></tr><tr><td>We shall take this slowly. Now, energy within any atom expands, but within a space so small that it is almost inconceivable to you. The atom you see does not then grow larger in mass, or expand outward in space, and neither does your universe.</td><td>这件事我们应该慢慢说。现在，任何原子之内的能量都会扩展，但是在一个这么小的空间之内，对你们来说几乎无法想像。你们看到的原子之后在质量上并不会变大，也不会在空间中向外扩展，你们的宇宙也是一样。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's pace was better now and her eyes were opening often, for sentences at time.)</td><td>(珍的节奏现在变得更好了，她的眼睛经常睁开，一次持续几句话的时间。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Something else here, that may at first sound unbelievable to you: The quasars are incredibly small, compared to the energy which they emit. The energy itself is so intense that it would seem that their size was considerable, but this is not the case.</td><td>现在。这里还有别的东西，一开始听起来可能让你难以置信；与它们散发的能量相比，类星体小到不可思议的程度。能量本身非常强烈，以至于它们的尺寸似乎相当大，但事实并非如此。</td></tr><tr><td>They are energy originators.</td><td>它们是能量创始者。</td></tr><tr><td>Their intensity gives them the appearance of mass, but there is no matter involved here, only electrical intensities, so swift that what you have is instantaneous motion and infinite electrical intensities.</td><td>它们的强度使它们具有质量的外观，但这里并不涉及物质，只有电场强度，所以你们拥有的是瞬时运动和无限的电场强度。</td></tr><tr><td>It is as if you were somewhere inside an atom, looking toward your own nucleus. When an atom is examined however within your system, you think of it as existing only within your system, for you only perceive with your instruments those aspects of it that are projected within your system.</td><td>就好像你是在一个原子内的某个地方，朝着你自己的原子核看去。不过，在你们的系统之内检查一颗原子时，你们以为它只存在于你们的系统之内，因为你们只能用仪器感知那些被投射在你们的系统之内的面向。</td></tr><tr><td>What you refer to as the nucleus of an atom therefore represents only a small portion of the whole nucleus. Part of the nucleus exists in antimatter. Part of the nucleus exists within other systems with which your scientists simply are not familiar.</td><td>因此，你们指的原子核只代表整个原子核的一小部分。部分的原子核存在反物质之中。部分的原子核存在你们的科学家根本不熟悉的其他系统之内。</td></tr><tr><td>They will not be able to perceive these hidden portions of any given atom with the methods they are now using. I have told you in the past that the same atoms are utilized, that is the same given atoms are utilized both in your system and in other systems. In like manner then these giant nuclei, or quasars, are only a part of reality, the part projected within your system.</td><td>他们无法使用他们现在使用的方法感知任何既定原子的这些隐藏部分。我过去告诉过你，相同的原子被利用，也就是说相同的既定原子在你们的系统和其他系统中被利用。因此以类似的方式，这些巨大的原子核，或类星体，只是实相的一部分，被投射在你们系统之内的那部分。</td></tr><tr><td>Atom smashers do not smash atoms. They merely change the atomic parts that appear within your own system. If man ever learned to so manipulate the whole atom, then indeed would there be disasters that have never been imagined.</td><td>原子击破器并没有击破原子。它们只不过改变了你们自己系统之内出现的原子部分。如果人类学会这样操纵整个原子，那么真的会发生从未想像过的灾难。</td></tr><tr><td>He can only play with the projections of reality within his own system. He can indeed do much damage, but only to his own camouflage universe. This physical universe is however quite important to him, after all, but he is well isolated within it.</td><td>他只能在他自己的系统之内玩玩实相的投射而已。他确实可以造成很大的伤害，但仅限于他自己的伪装宇宙。毕竟，这个物质宇宙对他来说相当重要，但他在其中却非常孤立。</td></tr><tr><td>He has constructed matter as an outward manifestation of inner reality. He can to some extent destroy matter, but he cannot destroy the inner reality.</td><td>他把物质建构成内在实相的外在显现。他在某种程度上能够破坏物质，但他无法破坏内在的实相。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a break and we shall continue.</td><td>我建议休息一下，我们再继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27. Jane was well dissociated once again. She said she has generally been "pretty jar out” since the material on the quasars began to come through, a few sessions ago. It is a subject we are very interested in.

She tried tracing out the image on the tabletop with a forefinger, but could get nothing beyond the idea of circles being involved.</td><td>(珍说她在讨论我们只看到原子在我们系统中的一部分时，她有一个画面。她试着用食指在桌面上描绘这个画面，但除了涉及圆圈的概念之外什么都表达不出来。</td></tr><tr><td>(Her pace had been fast between many short pauses, with her eyes open much of the time. She now resumed in the same manner at 9:37.)</td><td>(在很多次短暂地停顿之间，她的速度很快，大部分时间都睁着眼睛。9:37，她现在以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>The atom is in itself a far more complicated system than you know, and in many aspects your own system is no more than one atom.</td><td>原子本身就是一个比你知道的还要复杂很多的系统，而且在很多方面，你们自己的系统不只是一个原子。</td></tr><tr><td>When you begin to look further and further into the nature of physical matter, of course you get further and further away from it until at the heart of the matter there is no matter at all, and this is as far as you can go with your instruments; the heart of the atom as you know it.</td><td>当你开始越来越深入了解实物的本质，当然你就会离它越来越远，直到物质的核心里根本没有任何物质为止，而你们可以用你们的仪器达成的最远就到这里而已；你知道的原子核心。</td></tr><tr><td>If you could go further however you would come, in one dimension, to matter again. This would be what you call negative matter. Then going further you would travel away from matter again, until there was no more. And then there would be positive matter again, and so on.</td><td>如果你可以走得更远，那么你们会在一个维度中再度回到物质。这就是你们所谓的负物质。然后再走得更远，你们会再次远离物质，直到再也没有物质为止。然后又再次出现正物质，依此类推。</td></tr><tr><td>I am speaking of one dimension only, for in other dimensions, and traveling through the same atom, you would come to kinds of matter with which you are not at all familiar, even in theory. For the atom is a structure that deals with the formation of energy into matter, and it runs through, so to speak, all systems that have their basis within any matter system at all.</td><td>我说的只是一个维度而已，因为其他维度，而且是在同一个原子之内旅行，你们会遇到各种你们根本不熟悉的物质，甚至在理论上也是如此。因为原子是一种处理能量形成物质的结构，它们可以说是贯穿于所有在任何物质系统之内都有其基础的系统。</td></tr><tr><td>The invisible barriers of which I have spoken hold you back, so that when your perception fails to yield results then you imagine that there is nothing to perceive. Therefore you imagine that you perceive the whole of an atom, but you only perceive that portion which is projected into your own system.</td><td>我说过的无形障碍阻碍了你们，所以当你们的知觉无法产生结果时，你们就会想像没有什么可以感知的。因此，你们可以想像你感知整个原子，但你们只能感知被投射到你们自己系统中的那部分。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane now paused for over a minute, sitting quietly with her eyes closed.)</td><td>(珍现在停顿了一分钟，眼睛闭着，静静地坐着。)</td></tr><tr><td>Atoms do not create energy in a basic manner. They make energy usable within your system. Energy appears in your universe through the nucleus of the atom, but the nucleus is not the originator of the energy. It simply seems to be.</td><td>原子不是以基本的方式创造能量。它们在你们的系统之内创造可利用的能量。能量经由原子核出现在你们的宇宙里，但原子核不是能量的创始者。它就只是看起来似乎是而已。</td></tr><tr><td>The material on mental enclosures, given many sessions ago, will clarify this particular point.</td><td>很多节之前读过精神围场的资料可以阐明这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, quasars are originators of energy. All energy ultimately returns to them also. They are not on the far limits of your universe. They are projections from another system into your universe. They appear to be where they are not.</td><td>现在，类星体是能量的创始者。所有能量最终也会回归到它们身上。它们并不是在你们宇宙的极限之处。它们是从另一个系统进入你们宇宙的投射。它们看起来在不是它们所在之处。</td></tr><tr><td>Looking out at them, you view the future as much as you view the past, for as you know now, the future and the past are one, and all apparent separation or division is basically an illusion.

At first the data meant little, but Seth’s answer to the second question furnished the key that made it intelligible to us. It would have been quite opaque to an outsider. This is a case where Seth used the object as a springboard to delve into data that is connected to it through location mainly. My thought was that the bulk of the material he gives had more appeal emotionally for him than the object itself, and he confirmed this after break. Still, the turn the data took was unexpected.</td><td>(见前面物件描摹图及注释。起初，资料没什么意义，但赛斯对第二个问题的回答提供了关键，让我们能够理解它。它对于一个外人来说是很难理解的。这是赛斯使用物件作为跳板的一个案例，借此探索主要透过地点与它连结的资料。我的想法是，他给出的大部分资料对他比物件本身更具有情感的吸引力。他在休息后证实了这一点。不过，资料的转变出乎预期。</td></tr><tr><td>(The connection between the envelope object and the death-in-the-family reference is, simply, that the object was picked off the sidewalk beside the home of my Aunt Mabel, and that Aunt Mabel, Jane and I attended the funeral of the family member. The connection is more complicated than this, but to avoid confusion I will explain this portion mentioned above first.</td><td>(信封物件和家中有人死亡这件事之间的关联，纯粹是物件是从我的姨妈梅帛[Mabel]家旁边的人行道上捡到的，而梅帛姨妈、珍和我参加了家族成员的葬礼。关联比这个更复杂，但为了避免混淆，我先解释上文提到的这个部分。</td></tr><tr><td>(My Aunt Mabel lives around the corner and two blocks down the street from us. When Jane and I went for our leaf-gathering walk in October of1965, we picked up the maple leaves in our collection beside Aunt Mabel's home; this is the section of the street where the maple trees grow, and one of these leaves made up tonights object.</td><td>(我的梅帛姨妈住在同一条街的拐角处，距离我们两个街区。1965年10月，珍和我去散步采集叶子时，我们在梅帛家旁边捡到我们收集的枫叶；这段街道是枫叶生长的地方；其中一片叶子是今晚的物件。</td></tr><tr><td>(Aunt Mabel and I seldom see each other. Jane has met her just three times during the eleven years we have been married. The third time was at the funeral of my Aunt Ella on August 8,1965, in Wellsburg, NY. Thus the most recent time that Jane had a chance to speak at length to Aunt Mabel involved the funeral of a member of the Butts family. In addition Seth dealt at length with Aunt Elli in the 176th session of August 9,1965, the day after her funeral. Note that the object was secured two months after Aunt Ella's funeral. We have noticed this curious time jump before in the envelope experiments, backwards as it were. Jane possessed strong emotional memories regarding the funeral, and clairvoyant knowledge of the envelope object in some form; evidently Seth responded to, or deliberately chose, what he perceived as the stronger intensities pertaining to Aunt Ella’s funeral over the object itself.</td><td>(梅帛姨妈和我彼此很少见面。在我们结婚的11年里，珍只见过她3次。第三次是1965年8月8日在纽约州威尔斯堡，艾拉姨妈的葬礼上。因此最近珍有机会与梅帛姨妈长谈的一次是在一名拍兹家族成员的葬礼上。此外，在她葬礼的第二天，1965年8月9日的第176节，赛斯长篇讨论艾拉姨妈。注意，在艾拉姨妈的葬礼过后两个月，这个物件安全无误。我们注意到信封实验之前的这种奇怪的时间跳跃，可以说是时间倒流。珍对那场葬礼有着强烈的情感记忆，对信封物件也有某种形式的千里眼知识；显然赛斯回应或故意选择了他感知的情感强度，而不是物件本身，它们和艾拉姨妈的葬礼有关，而且更为强烈。</td></tr><tr><td>(It appears that Jane has formed an association that links Aunt Mabel with funerals, as seen above. If this seems tenuous, we think the idea reinforced by the fact that Jane and me and Aunt Mabel also attended another funeral together—that of Aunt Mabel’s husband, who died several years ago. This was the first time Jane met Aunt Mabel. Thus Aunt Mabel was involved with funerals and related activities on two out of the three occasions that Jane has spoken with her; these two occasions being the times when Jane could exchange more than greetings with her, also. Jane and I do not think tonight’s envelope data contains any references to the death of Aunt Mabel’s husband.</td><td>(如上文所述，看起来珍形成了一个连结梅帛姨妈和葬礼的联想。如果这看似薄弱，那我们认为珍和我以及梅帛姨妈也一起参加另一场葬礼的这个事实强化了这个想法——几年前梅帛姨妈的亡夫葬礼。那是珍第一次见到梅帛姨妈。因此，在梅帛姨妈参加的三次葬礼和相关活动中，珍有两次和她说过话；这就是珍不只是打招呼还能够交流的两次。珍和我认为今晚的信封资料完全没有提到梅帛姨妈的亡夫之死。</td></tr><tr><td>(There is a reference to another death in the data however, this time to the passing of Jane's grandmother many years ago. This will be explained later.</td><td>(但是，资料中提到了另一个死亡，这次是珍的祖母在多年前去世的事。后面将会解释。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane said that while giving the data this evening she thought of Aunt Ella by name, but did not give voice to this.</td><td>(珍说，今晚在给出资料的同时，她想到了艾拉姨妈的名字，但没有开口说出。</td></tr><tr><td>(It will be more convenient to go through the data by topic. First then follows the connections with Aunt Ella's funeral through Aunt Mabel, with brief descriptions.</td><td>(按照主题浏览资料会更方便。所以，首先透过梅帛姨妈追溯到艾拉姨妈葬礼的关联，并加上简要的描述。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with a series, and with several unpleasant episodes.” This refers to a series of telephone calls Jane found herself involved in when Aunt Ella died unexpectedly. The calls, most of them long distance, involved my parents and my brother and his family, and concerned topics like transportation, expenses, times, etc. I was at work during this period and couldn't help. Jane found this quite unpleasant.</td><td>(“和一连串，以及几个不愉快的事件有关联。”这是指当艾拉姨妈死亡时。珍发现她自己参与其中的一连串电话。这些电话，大多数是长途电话，对象是我的父母以及我的弟弟和他的家人，话题是交通运输、费用、时间等等。在这段期间，我在工作，所以帮不上忙。珍觉得这件事很不愉快。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A four. ’’ We believe Aunt Ella's funeral services were held at four PM on August 8,1965.</td><td>(“一个4。”我们相信艾拉姨妈的葬礼是在1965年8月8日下午4点举行。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Tension, as something evenly balanced. Tension like wires... As in trying to go two ways at once. A pulling in two directions, with a balance of tension resulting.

Everybody had their own ideas, and the conflict had to be resolved on rather short notice. Things were of course finally straightened out.</td><td>(“张力，就像某个东西完全平衡那样。像电线一样的张力……就像试图同时走两条路一样。两个方向的拉力，结果产生张力的平衡。”珍在主观上确定这些印象是指她参与其中的电话，以及家庭成员互相冲突的欲望。每个人都有自己的想法，冲突必须在相当短的时间内化解掉。最后事情当然都顺利解决了。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Gun. Something to do with a gun, or something triggered, or explosive.” More references to the situation outlined above. Note that most of this data has meaning for Jane in a strong way because of the emotional content, and that I am relatively unaffected. As stated, the connection between the envelope object and Aunt Mabel and her home had to be made before this data fell into place. I did not understand much of it on my own.</td><td>(“枪。与一支枪，或某个被触发或爆炸性的东西有关。”更多与上述情况有关的资料。注意，由于其中的情感内涵，这个资料大部分对珍具有极大的意义，但相对来说对我没有影响。如上所述，在这个资料水落石出之前，得先找到信封物件与梅帛姨妈和她的家之间有何连结。光靠我自己是无法了解它的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Unpleasant episodes remind Ruburt of your parents. In connection with the episodes, four, four in the afternoon or four people, two male and two female. A distant connection here with a death in the family involved. ’’ The death in the family reference here could mean only Aunt Ella, which led us to Aunt Mabel and her home, near inhere we obtained the envelope object. Without going into detail here we can say that four refers both to the time of the funeral services, and an idea involving Jane and me and my parents, in connection with the funeral, that wasn't carried out.</td><td>(“不愉快的事件让鲁柏想起了你的父母。和事件有关，4，下午4点或4个人，两男两女。这里有一个遥远的关联涉及到家族里有一个人死亡。”这里所说的家族里有人死亡，可能只是指艾拉姨妈，它让我们想到梅帛姨妈和她家，因为我们是在她家附近取得信封物件的。这里我们就不详述了，只能说，这4次都是指葬礼的时间，以及涉及珍、我以及我父母的一个想法，这个想法与葬礼有关但没有实行。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now here is the data referring to the death of Jane's grandmother: “Printed material with a picture. In parentheses: Ruburt thinks of old-fashioned Shredded Wheat cards, that were gray-blue in color.

Jane remembers clearly that on the day of her grandmother's death she did not like what she had for supper. As children do, she cried and made a fuss. To placate her, her grandmother gave in to Jane's demands for Shredded Wheat, and left the house.</td><td>(现在这里有关于珍的祖母死亡的资料：“印有图片的资料。(括号：鲁柏认为是老式的小麦谷物卡片，颜色是灰蓝。)”在珍6岁的时候，她的祖母去社区小店买小麦谷物时被一辆车撞死。这里的连结对珍来说是一个强烈情感连结。珍清楚记得，在她祖母去世的那天，她不喜欢她吃的晚餐。和所有小孩一样，她又哭又闹。为了安抚她，她的祖母让步，答应珍的要求，给她吃小麦谷物，而离开家门。</td></tr><tr><td>(There follows a group of impressions related to a child.

The curling took place as they dried out; they had been damp from being outside. This curl cannot be seen in the tracing on page 91 to any degree. In order to get the object inside the first of the two envelopes I had to flatten it out. This pressure caused the leaf to crack in many places; it is by now very brittle. After the experiment I had to tape it to a sheet of paper in order to preserve it for the notebook in which we keep our envelope objects.</td><td>(“而且这里有某个好像往内凹的东西。”对我来说很有趣，贴切地描述了在我非常详细地画这幅素描的那几天里，两片叶子的边缘如何卷曲。卷曲发生在它们干掉的时候；它们之前在室外，所以本来是潮湿的。在前面的描摹图上看不到卷曲。为了把物件放进两个信封的第一个里面，我不得不把它弄平。这个压力导致叶子有很多部分都裂开了；它现在非常脆弱。在实验之后，我不得不把它粘贴在一张纸上，才能放进我们保留信封物件的笔记本里面来保存它。</td></tr><tr><td>(There are a few other impressions that we made no connection for, nor did we ask Seth about the m-i-s-s data.

We thought it would be possible also to recoup on the lnstream objects.</td><td>(按照赛斯在4月11日的上一节定期课提出的建议，珍决定跳过4月13日星期三的课，4月18日下周一的课也可能不举行。她说，每周例行公事让她感觉有一种相当轻微的压力，也认为这个改变具有恢复活力的作用。我们认为从殷斯翠姆物件得到收获也是有可能的。</td></tr><tr><td>(An unplanned session was held on Friday evening however, and will be briefly summarized for the record. No notes were made during the session by me, although some of the witnesses made a few. The session had some unusual aspects.</td><td>(不过，星期五晚上举行了一次临时课，将会简略摘要作为记录。我这一节上课期间没有写任何笔记，但是有些见证者记了一些。这一节有一些不同寻常的面向。</td></tr><tr><td>(The witnesses were Ann Diebler, Marilyn and Don Wilbur, and the Gallaghers. The same group witnessed an unscheduled session described in the notes for the 214th session of December 6,1965. See Volume 5.</td><td>(见证人是安·黛伯乐、玛丽莲、唐·韦伯以及加拉格夫妇。同一群人也见证了一节临时课，在1965年12月6日第214节的注释描述过。见第五册。</td></tr><tr><td>(The session came about after Jane had played portions of the tape of the 170th session for the group. This is the tape containing the strong voice effects and was recorded for Dr. lnstream. It was made with the Gallaghers as witnesses. The other three witnesses are young people and had no idea that such physical performances were possible over a period of hours. Playing the tape was an attempt to answer some of their questions, and in this Jane and I were following Seth’s advice of the 246th session. During that session Seth suggested Jane and I do all we can to inform others who are interested in matters psychic. See Session 170 in Volume 5.</td><td>(差不多在珍为这群人播放了第170节的部分录音之后，这一节就开始了。这块录音带包含强大的声音效应，是为殷斯翠姆博士录制的。它是在加拉格夫妇当见证者的时候录下的。其他三位见证者是年轻人，对这样可能持续几小时的身体表现没有意见。播放录音带是想要回答他们的一些问题，珍和我也按照赛斯在第246节的建议进行。在那一节，赛斯建议珍和我对于其他有兴趣了解心灵事物的人要尽可能知无不言。见第四册第170节。</td></tr><tr><td>(More voice effects were demonstrated now. The session was not actually a long one, and ended in Jane's physical illness. Seth came through after some of the stronger voice effects on the tape had been played. The stage had been set through conversation and the use of the tape, and I thought Seth made his appearance with the subconscious permission of Jane and me. No one had asked to hear a session.</td><td>(此时更多的声音效应已经显现。这一节其实不长，最后是以珍的身体疾病作结。在播放录音带上一些更强大的声音效应之后，赛斯过来了。透过交谈和利用录音带，把舞台架设起来，而且我认为赛斯是在珍和我的潜意识允许下现身的。没有人要求上课。</td></tr><tr><td>(As it happened many people who live in the house were away for various reasons, so Seth was well aware that neighbors wouldn't be a hindrance to voice effects—at least as much as usual. One person was still home upstairs however, as I reminded Jane; the reminder had little effect.</td><td>(因为很多住在这间房子里的人刚好基于各种原因不在家。所以赛斯很清楚邻居不会成为声音交谈的障碍——至少和平时一样。但是，我提醒珍，楼上有一个人还在家；不过，提醒的效果不大。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth reiterated some of the earlier material he has given us, concerning proof, apparitions, etc. Once again he went into the reasons why it was possible for Bill Macdonnel to see Seth's apparition during the 68th session for July 6,1964. See that session. The gist of tonight's material on this subject was that Bill allowed his intuitions enough freedom so that he was able to see the apparition for over an hour and to make several drawings of it; by the same token Jane and I were unable to see the apparition because we tried to intellectualize it. Later in the 68th session however I did see, along with Bill, a very striking change in Jane’s physical features. We believe this was another form of apparition. See Volume 2.</td><td>(赛斯重申了他之前给我们的一些资料，关于证据、幻影等等。他再次探讨比尔·麦唐纳为什么能够在1964年7月6日第68节看到赛斯幻影的原因。见那一节。今晚关于这个问题的资料，要点是比尔允许他的直觉有足够的自由，以至于他能够看见幻影超过一个小时，并且做了几幅画；出于同样的原因，珍和我无法看见幻影，因为我们试图把它理智化。然而在第68节后来，我确实和比尔一起看到珍的身体特征发生非常显著的变化。我们相信这是另一种形式的幻影。见第二册。</td></tr><tr><td>(As he stated in the 68th and 170th sessions, Seth said that should he materialize in full view in the middle of the room it would not be considered as evidence by those who did not wish to believe it possible; they would ascribe it to mass hallucination, etc. I planned to ask Seth about photographic evidence of such an event, following break, but did not get the chance to.</td><td>(正如他在第68节和第170节说的那样，赛斯说，如果他在房间正中央一览无余地具体显现，那些不相信它可能的人也不会认为这是证据；他们会把它归之于集体的幻觉之类的。我打算在休息之后向赛斯询问这类事件的照片证据，但没有机会问。</td></tr><tr><td>(Nor according to Seth would the voice effects be accepted as any kind of evidence, until certain measuring instruments were used in a scientifically-controlled experiment. Seth did not get a chance to elaborate on this either.</td><td>(据赛斯的说法，在某些测量仪器被用于科学控制的实验之前，人们不会接受声音效应是任何一种证据。赛斯也没有详细说明这一点。</td></tr><tr><td>(Some good voice effects were manifested this evening, although they were not up to those of the 170th session. I would say subjectively that they were probably second best however. Tonight Jane spoke while sitting down, in an informal manner; in the 170th she stood erect with her head thrown back. In the 170th she also spoke for several hours and had time to build up to it; I would estimate she spoke for less than half an hour before break this evening, and but a very few minutes after resuming.</td><td>(虽然没有达到第170节的效果，但是今晚有不错的声音效应具体显现。不过，主观看来，我会说它们可能仅次于最好。今晚，珍以一种不正式的态度坐着说话；在第170节，她站着，头往后仰。在第170节，她也说了几个小时的话，有时间逐渐形成效应；我估计今晚她在休息前说了不到半小时的话，在继续之后只讲了几分钟。</td></tr><tr><td>(Ann Diebler asked Seth to give some information on a friend who lives in Norfolk, Virginia. Seth complied very briefly after break.</td><td>(安·黛伯乐要求赛斯提供住在维吉尼亚州诺福克[Norfolk, Virginia]一名友人的讯息。赛斯在休息后非常简短地说了一些。</td></tr><tr><td>(Friday afternoon Jane had not been feeling particularly well, but did not tell me. Perhaps this is related to her getting sick after the session tonight; we plan to ask Seth. In fact, the session was cut short by Jane's illness. A long break was taken after the first delivery; Jane's voice was good, her points very emphatic, and her eyes wide open some of the time as she answered questions. She had very little to drink—two small glasses of wine, and felt recovered from her indisposition of the afternoon.</td><td>(星期五下午，珍感觉不太舒服，但没有告诉我。也许这和她今晚上课之后就生病有关系；我们打算问赛斯。实际上，这一节因为珍的病而缩短了。在第一段传述休息了很久；珍的声音很好，非常强调重点，而且在回答问题时，她的双眼大睁，持续了一些时间。她喝的酒很少——两小杯葡萄酒。并且感觉从她下午的不适中恢复无气了。</td></tr><tr><td>(During the long break I felt that peoples attention wandered. Jane later confirmed that she was aware of this, and was upset by it. I am personally not much enthused about such informal sessions, although Seth has said at various times that they can be beneficial in ways that regular sessions are not. But it is not easy to maintain the unflagging attention of a group of people on a weekend night, especially when they gather to eat and drink.</td><td>(在长时间的休息过程中，我感觉大家的注意力四处游走。珍后来证实她也觉察到这一点，并且为之烦恼。我个人对这种非正式的课并不十分热衷，尽管赛斯曾多次表示它们具有定期课没有的好处。但是在周末晚上要维持一群人不懈的注意力，特别是当他们聚在一起吃吃喝喝的时候，并不容易。</td></tr><tr><td>(Everyone present is sympathetic to the Seth experience of course, and as stated I felt Jane and I had given permission for Seth to speak. More often than not after such an experience we wish it hadn't taken place; at the same time we feel that such sessions are another facet of the Seth experience, and as such should take place at least to some extent.</td><td>(在座的每个人当然都支持赛斯经验，而之前也说过，我感觉珍和我已经同意赛斯说话。在这样的经验之后，我们经常希望它没有发生过；同时我们也觉得这样的课是赛斯经验的另一面，因此至少在某种程度上应该要发生。</td></tr><tr><td>(These experiences always raise the question of control for Jane, but since the sessions began there have been no hints or clues to the fact that she is not in control of them. We do not think any session has been held without permission on both our parts.</td><td>(这些经验总是引发珍的控制问题，但是，自从课开始以来，没有任何暗示或线索表明，她没有控制它们。我们认为，没有我们两个人的允许，任何一节课都是不可能举行的。</td></tr><tr><td>(During the long break after the first delivery, Jane had a little more to drink, but nothing out of the ordinary by any means. However when she resumed Seth stated that she had drunk too much and that he did not like to work with Ruburt under such conditions. He would therefore end the session. He gave Ann Diebler a few lines of data concerning her friend in Virginia, which she wrote out. Seth then ended the session. Jane's voice had been quiet after break.</td><td>(在第一次传述之后的长时间休息中，珍又喝了一点酒，但无论如何都没有任何异常。但是当她继续时，赛斯说她喝太多了，还说他不喜欢与这种状况下的鲁柏一起工作。因此，他会结束这一节。关于安·黛伯乐在维吉尼亚州的朋友，他给了几句话的资料，她记下了。赛斯随后结束了这一节。珍的声音在休息之后一直很安静。</td></tr><tr><td>(Shortly after this, while I was in the studio with Marilyn and Ann, I was informed that Jane was being physically sick in the kitchen. I immediately felt that the illness resulted from her conflicts over having the session, and the next day she confirmed this. Peggy Gallagher administered to Jane, and company then left.</td><td>(在这之后不久，我和玛丽莲以及安在工作室，有人告诉我珍在厨房里身体不舒服。我立刻感觉这个病的起因是，她对于上课与否的冲突，第二天她确认了这一点。蓓·加拉格帮忙珍，并且陪了她之后才离开。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane later said that she was sure she hadn’t had too much to drink, and that she had become very upset over company behavior while the tape was being played, etc. This was complicated by her self-questioning over the matter of control, and whether we should have nothing but regular sessions. I lean toward the latter view, yet do not want to be too strict; according to Seth spontaneous expression is very important. And of course by and large Jane is interested in regular sessions. She is concerned that unscheduled sessions can be construed as exhibitionism; we think that this plays some part in certain unscheduled sessions. All sessions however have been productive in a variety of ways.</td><td>(珍后来说，她确定自己没有喝太多酒，而且在播放录音带的过程中，她对客人的行为感到非常沮丧等等。她对于控制问题、我们应不应该只举行定期课等等的自我怀疑，让这件事变得很复杂。我倾向于后面这个观点，但又不想过于严格；根据赛斯的说法，自发的表达非常重要。当然，总的来说，珍对定期课有兴趣。她担心临时课可能被人当成是表现欲；我们认为这个担忧在某些临时课当中扮演某种角色。但是，所有的课都是富有成效的，只是方式各异而已。</td></tr><tr><td>(To date, out of 251 sessions 24 have been unscheduled. Some of these have involved only Jane and me. The rest have involved a small group of interested people, and it is probably fair to say that the question of exhibitionism has arisen in Janes mind on but three or four occasions. We are very cautious here, actually, hence my earlier statement that after such a session we wonder whether we should have allowed it to take place.) By PEG GALLAGHER A painting of a nude woman, which has been on display in the window of an E. Water St. gallery, will not be removed-even though the owner says police have ordered him to do so. William C. Macdonell, owner of the Cameron Studio Gallery at 334 E. Water St., said the only concession be has made is to turn the painting slightly so that it does not face the street. The oil painting, about 20 by 24 inches, was painted by Macdonell. In washed out shades of gray and orange, it shows a woman sitting reflectively, with a bouquet of flowers in the background. Macdonell says he was ordered by police on three occasions last week to remove the painting. When he refused, he said, police told him the matter would be turned over to the district attorney. Police Chief John J. O’Connor said today be had not ordered the painting removed. And Dist. Atty. Paul H. McCabe said he has received no report on the matter. However, written reports indicate the police have scrutinized the situation carefully. And it appears that there is some disagreement within police ranks on whether the painting is obscene. In a written report, at least one officer noted that he considered the painting offensive. And at least one other who went to check it reported that he sa no objection to it. Chief O’Connor denied that Macdonell had been ordered to remove the painting. He said he knew of only one investigation, made on Friday, after one anonymous complaint was received. He said he asked an officer to check the painting but did not ask him to remove it. O’Connor said he was not on duty Saturday or Sunday and did not know whether further action was taken. He plans to check on the matter, he said. The painting is placed unobtrusively among a collection of brightly colored abstracts, ceramics and metal sculpture. Macdonell said he put it in the window about a week ago when he changed displays.</td><td>1966年4月20日第252节第48次信封实验使用的标的物，1966年4月18日埃尔迈拉报纸文章的局部影本(到当前为止，在250节当中有24节是临时课。其中一些只牵涉到珍和我。其余的则和一小群感兴趣的人有关，而且表现欲这个问题在珍的心中出现过3、4次，这样说应该公平吧，实际上，我们对此非常谨慎，因此我早些时候才会说，在这样的课之后，我们怀疑我们应不应该允许它发生。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 252</td><td>第252节 珍的能力提高 信封48</td></tr><tr><td>APRIL 20, 1966 9 PM WEDNESDAY AS SCHEDULED</td><td>1966年4月20日 星期三 晚上9点 定期课</td></tr><tr><td>(The scheduled session for Monday, April 18 was not held, and we enjoyed the change of pace. We hoped Seth would deal with any object Dr. Instream had focused on Monday night, as well as the object for last Wednesday April 13.</td><td>(4月18日星期一的定期课没有举行，我们很享受这个步调的变化。我们希望赛斯能够处理殷斯翠姆博士在周一晚上聚焦所在的任何物件，以及4月13日上周三的物件。</td></tr><tr><td>(The 48th envelope experiment was held during the session. See the copy of the object on page 104. We had saved the article because it dealt with our friend Bill Macdonnel, who has witnessed several sessions. When Bill visited us early this evening I thought of using the clipping as object.</td><td>(第48次信封实验在课间举行。见上面的标的物影本。我们保存这篇文章，是因为它谈到我们的朋友比尔·麦唐纳，他见证过几节课。当比尔今晚早些时候来拜访我们时，我想到用这张剪报作为物件。</td></tr><tr><td>( I found other copies of the article after the session. The actual copy used in the envelope is as usual on file in our object notebook. On the partial copy attached to page 104 I penned in the row of numbers representing the date after the session. The session was a comparatively short one and Seth did not go into each point in the data. Some of the data is self-explanatory when checked against the article.</td><td>(这一节结束后，我找到这篇文章的其他影本。信封中使用的正本照惯例归档在我们的物件笔记本。在上面的局部影本上，我于课后写下代表日期的那行数字。这一节相对较短，赛斯没有谈到资料上的每一点。根据文章核对，有些资料是不言自明的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was still not feeling tiptop, but thought she would rather have the session than miss it. It was held in our font room. She began speaking while sitting down and with her eyes closed, in a quiet voice and with short pauses.)</td><td>(珍仍然觉得不太舒服，但是她认为她宁愿上课也不要错过。这一节在我们前面的房间举行。她坐下来开始讲话，闭着眼睛，声音安静，有几次短暂地停顿。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, good evening.</td><td>现在， 晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth.')</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>I have given you a rest, and this will be as Ruburt correctly supposed a short session.</td><td>我让你们休息了一下，这一节正如鲁柏所料会是一节短课。</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment here, to make some explanations clear.</td><td>这里给我们一点时间，理清一些解释。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt is making certain rather important inner adjustments, that are resulting, or will very shortly result, in a definite expansion of consciousness and ability. To some extent these changes are structural, in that pathways of activity are being formed more completely.</td><td>鲁柏正在进行一些相当重要的内在调整，结果或很快会产生的结果，意识和能力的明确扩展。在某种程度上，这些变化是有结构的，因为活动的途经正在更加完整地成形中。</td></tr><tr><td>This involves an assimilation on the part of Ruburts whole personality, that is quite important for his overall development. It is difficult to explain some of this in words, but connections are being formed, actually in terms of psychic structures, so that a much larger amount of inner data will become available to Ruburt on a conscious level.</td><td>这涉及到鲁柏整体人格的同化，这对他的整体发展是非常重要的。难以用语言解释其中的一些内容，但实际上就心灵结构而言，连结正在形成，好让鲁柏在意识层面上能够取用数量多了很多的内在资料。</td></tr><tr><td>The pathways are now becoming clear enough so that a change will be effectively apparent. Some of this is the result of the practice gained in psychic manipulation through our sessions themselves.</td><td>这些途径现在正变得够清楚，这样改变才会有效地外显。这当中有些是透过我们的课本身练习心灵操纵而获得的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>Generally speaking the same sort of developments are taking place in you also, Joseph, but because of the peculiar and significant balances that exist between Ruburt and myself these developments are perhaps of a somewhat different nature as far as he is concerned. We are indeed reaching a sort of breakthrough which will be most auspicious. The increase of ability on his part will be a qualitative one and a general one; that is, not one limited to psychic affairs. It is bound to improve his psychic performance however.</td><td>一般来说，同样的发展也正发生在你身上，约瑟，但因为存在鲁柏和我自己之间特殊而重要的平衡，所以就他而言，这些发展可能具有一点不同的性质。我们确实正在达到一种最为吉利的突破。他的能力将会在性质上普遍提升；也就是说，不仅限于心灵事物。然而，它必定会改善他的心灵技能。</td></tr><tr><td>It is in the nature of an integration, an integrating reorganization in which insights and knowledge usually hidden in the main from conscious awareness, can now be effectively used and recognized. This integration naturally enough will rather vastly increase the physical performance. However in this period of its initial phases there is bound to be some physical effect as the system stabilizes itself.</td><td>它具有整合的本质，一种整合重组，其中基本上通常躲过意识觉知的洞见和知识，现在可以被有效地使用并得到认可了。这种整合自然足以大大增进身体机能。然而，在它的初始阶段这一时间，随着系统本身的稳定，必然会产生一些身体效应。</td></tr><tr><td>Biochemistry is indeed involved, and certain new chemical balances are now being achieved. The result physically has been a slight indisposition which will shortly vanish, and be replaced in fact by a much more efficient health standard as a matter of course.</td><td>确实涉及生物化学，而且目前正在达成某些新的化学平衡。结果在身体上是一种轻微的不适，很快就会消失，而且事实上当然会被更有效率的健康标准取而代之。</td></tr><tr><td>It is very possible that the sinus condition itself will be very much improved.</td><td>鼻窦状况本身很可能大为改善。</td></tr><tr><td>Take a brief break and we shall continue, although not for long.</td><td>短暂休息一下，我们再继续，但不会持续很久。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:16. Jane had been dissociated as usual for a first break. Her eyes had remained closed, her pace the same.</td><td>(9:16休息。在第一次休息时，珍一如以往出离。她的眼睛闭着，速度不变。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth’s material above could explain the strange malaise she has been aware of in recent days, and we believe prompted Seth to call for the time off in the first place, in the 250th session.</td><td>(上文的赛斯资料可以说明她最近几天觉察到的那种奇怪的全身无力，我们相信这促使赛斯最初在第250节要求休假。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's increased abilities could already be revealing themselves. She has been doing very well on her book on dreams recently; this afternoon she remarked that it was going so well that she wondered where the material was coming from. Seth spoke on the integration of our personalities also in the 228th session; the material grew out of his material on the poetry book Jane produced so effortlessly. Our thought is that the dream book material is also appearing in the same way. According to Seth we are just beginning to use our creative abilities.</td><td>(珍增进的能力可能已经自行显露了。最近她写谈梦的那本书写得非常顺利；今天下午，她说写得太顺了，以至于她都怀疑资料是从哪里画的了。赛斯也在。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same quiet manner, her eyes again closed at 9:25.)</td><td>(珍以同样平静的方式继续，再次闭上了眼睛，9:25。)</td></tr><tr><td>I had several points to mention.</td><td>我有几句话要说。</td></tr><tr><td>The results of this new integration are only now beginning to show in Ruburts work. They will become more apparent, and the whole Seth book will benefit now also. Ruburts experience with his friend Marian, was in a strange way also a result of his increased abilities.</td><td>这个新的整合现在才刚刚开始在鲁柏的工作上展现它的结果。它们将变得更加明显，整体赛斯书也会受益。鲁柏和他的朋友玛丽安的经验，虽然奇怪，但也是他能力增进产生的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>He picked up her physical symptoms, you see, sympathetically, and he must learn to guard himself now against such occurrences. This can be done by clearing his mind, and suggesting that all alien impulses or conditions be removed. As sensitivity increases it will be necessary for him to distinguish among them; that is, to distinguish so that he realizes the differences between his own sensations, and any he may have inadvertently picked up. He will have no difficulty doing this. His abilities have increased, in line with his discipline, so that he will be able to make such distinctions. The first instance simply caught him unawares.</td><td>他接收到她的身体症状，你知道，带着同情心，而且他现在必须学会保证自己免受这类事件的影响。透过清理他的心智，以及清除所有外来冲动或状况的暗示，就可以达到这个目的。随着敏感度的提高，他有必要区分它们；也就是说，要区分，这样他才会发觉他自身的感受与任何他可以无意间接收到的感觉之间有何差异。这样做对他来说没有任何困难。他的能力随着他的纪律而增强，因此他能够做出这样的区分。第一个例子只不过是出其不意而已。</td></tr><tr><td>(True. See the summary of the unscheduled 247th session, which was held at the home of our landlady, Marian Spaziani. In the session Seth dealt with the coming operation Marian faces for an ovarian tumor that is benign, and gave Marian ideas for suggestion. Jane visited with Marian one morning early last week, and for the next day or two remarked that she felt quite like Marians description of her own symptoms. We considered that Jane was reacting to suggestion here, but were rather surprised since Jane knows how to guard against negative suggestion as a rule.</td><td>(确实。见第247节的摘要，那一节在我们的房东太太玛丽安·史帕日尼家中举行。课间，赛斯处理了玛丽安因为良性卵巢肿瘤而面临即将的手术，并且让玛丽安了解暗示的作用。上周刚开始的一天早上，珍拜访了玛丽安，在接下来的一两天里，她的感觉很像玛丽安对自身症状的描述。我们认为这里珍是对暗示起了反应，但是，因为珍在多数情况下知道如何防范负面暗示，所以我们感到非常惊讶。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's eyes had been opening at times. Now they closed, and she sat back to give the data for the 56th Dr. Instream experiment.)</td><td>(珍的眼睛有时候睁开着。现在它们闭上了，她往后靠着坐，开始传述第56次殷斯翠姆博士实验的资料。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now give us a moment.

See the summary of the unscheduled 251st session. Seth cut the session short, and after the five witnesses had left Jane was physically sick to her stomach three successive times. We both thought it a panic reaction. Later Jane told me she had very little memory of what Seth had said, even in the very strong voice; this is unusual for her.)</td><td>(珍在传述最后一句时停顿了很长时间。见第251节临时课的摘要。赛斯缩短了那一节的时间，而且在5名见证人离开后，珍连续吐了3次。我们两人都认为这是一种恐慌反应。后来珍告诉我，她对赛斯说的话几乎毫无记忆，即使赛斯是非常有力的声音说话；这对她来说很不寻常。)</td></tr><tr><td>He allowed me to come through in a more definite fashion. The channels, so to speak, were wide open because of his increased abilities. He felt a surge of energy however and did not know how to control or direct it.</td><td>他允许我以更明确的方式透过来。可以说，因为他的能力增强了，所以这些通道是敞开的。然而，他感觉到一股能量，却不知道如何控制或指挥它。</td></tr><tr><td>He has already learned how to do so, and so he is over that hump.</td><td>他已经学会怎么做了，所以他已经度过那个难关。</td></tr><tr><td>Did you have an envelope for me, Joseph?</td><td>约瑟，你有没有信封要给我？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes.”</td><td>(“有。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused at 9:40, then took the envelope for our 48th experiment from me without opening her eyes.

Since Seth had announced a short session I hadn't anticipated the chance to ask many questions—or even that an experiment would be held.

When the experiments began any sort of interruption as far as the envelopes were concerned resulted in a letdown in the next few experiments.</td><td>(实验结果很好，而且这里请注意，它们是在短暂休息之后取得的。当实验开始时，就信封而言，任何形式的中断都会在接下来的几次实验导致失望。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane progresses step by step. At the moment she said she feels uneasy when I ask questions pertaining directly to the object, but that she knows this will pass in the light of past experience. In the beginning also she could not name an object for Dr. Instream regardless of questions of accuracy. She does so easily now in most cases. Jane explained that our own experiments call up a chain of personal associations which she must sort out in reciting the data. She is not concerned with this in the Instream material.</td><td>(珍一步一步前进。此刻，她说当我提出与物件直接相关的问题时，她感到不安，但她知道按照过去的经验，她知道这会过去的。一开始的时候，不管问题有多精确，她也说不出殷斯翠姆博士的物件名称。在大部分情况下，她现在很容易就做到了。珍解释说，我们自己的实验调用一连串个人的联想，她必须在叙述资料时理清它们。在殷斯翠姆资料中，她并不担心这件事。</td></tr><tr><td>(This did mark the end of the session as far as Seth was concerned. Jane and I made the connections that were clear to us. We would have liked Seth’s help on a few, but did not ask him to resume.

" Originally I tore the article out of the paper. Note that signs of this are still visible on the left hand edge. The bottom of the clipping was also rough, and I clipped it evenly with scissors before filing it; this was before I thought of using it as object; Jane of course knew I saved the article because it pertained to Bill Macdonnel. As it happened my clipping the article along the bottom made it fit just right between the usual two pieces of Bristol, and into the double envelopes.</td><td>(“和某个裂开或撕裂的东西有关联。”最初我撕下报纸上的文章。请注意，左手边仍然看得到手撕的痕迹。剪报的底部也是粗糙的，我用剪刀把它修齐之后才归档；这是在我想到要用它作为物件之前；珍当然知道我保存了文章，因为它与比尔·麦唐纳有关。因为碰巧我沿着底部剪下文章，而使它恰好能够放进两片普通的纸板之间，然后装入双开信封里。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with a schedule, ’’ Bill Macdonnel's gallery referred to in the article is a converted store with an inset door.

Directly in back of the painting is a large circular ceramic sculpture, perhaps a foot in diameter, that is more egg-shaped than a perfect circle. This has a textured, matte surface. Just to the right of this sculpture is another egg-shaped sculpture; this one is of polished silvery metal and is perhaps ten inches across. It stands on a wooden pedestal; the polished reflections in it seem to move as one's viewpoint changes.

Two of the people are named in the sixth column of the envelope object. These two supported Bill’s decision to leave the painting in the window. The third man, Ernfred Anderson, who has a national reputation as a sculptor and teacher at Elmira College, and is a close friend of Bill, Jane and mine, advised Bill to remove the painting. Bill told Jane and me this on his visit earlier this evening, although we had heard this from other friends several days ago.</td><td>(“特别是三个人有关联。”当警察要求比尔从他的画廊橱窗撤掉这幅画时，他特别问了3个人有何建议。其中两个人在信封物件的第六栏被公开姓名。这两个人支持比尔决定将这幅画留在橱窗。第三个人，厄恩费雷·安德森[Ernfred Anderson]，是享有全国声誉的雕塑家，也是埃尔迈拉学院[Elmira College]的老师，而且是比尔、珍和我的密友，他建议比尔撤掉这幅画。今晚早些时候，比尔在来访时告诉珍和我这件事，但是几天前我们就从其他朋友那里听到这个消息了。</td></tr><tr><td>(“An announcement, as in an announcement of intention.” The first paragraph of the envelope object contains Bill Macdonnel’s intention not to remove the painting from the gallery window even though requested to do so by the police.

We saw the Gallaghers on Sunday evening and learned that she still hadn't seen Bill Macdonnel. Her story however was printed on Monday, April 18, which means she had to see Bill sometime Monday morning. This was possible because Bill Macdonnel, as a teacher, was still on Easter vacation. See also the “something not kept” reference and interpretation on page 109.</td><td>(“印象同样也是关于一个不在计划中的事件，或一个没有履行的事件。”珍确定是指蓓·加拉格，用作信封物件的这篇新闻报道是她写的。4月15日星期五，珍和我以及加拉格夫妇听说比尔的问题，蓓计划在星期六打电话给比尔，但没有打。我们在周日晚上见到加拉格夫妇并得知她还没有见到比尔。然而她的报道是在4月18日星期一打印的，这表示她必须在星期一早上的某个时候见到比尔。这是可能的，因为身为老师的比尔还在放复活节假期。另见前面“某个没有履行的事情”的关联和解读。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A series of numbers, and an indication of the passage of time.” When I tore the article from the newspaper I wrote the month, day and year on it, not realizing the date was printed on the reverse side.</td><td>(“一连串数字，以及时间流逝的指示。”当我从报纸上撕下这篇文章时，我在上面写下了年月日，没有发现日期就写在背面。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Blue green, written with a pen, or the color of blue ink.” I wrote the date at the top of the object with a ballpoint pen containing blue ink—the same pen used to duplicate this series of numbers on the copy of the object included with this session.

See the data and our interpretation on page 109, with the description of the two near-circular sculptures in the same window of Bill Macdonnel’s gallery, with the disputed nude painting. Seth gave the above data when I asked him to clarify his original data on page 108. The smaller of the two sculptures is more egg-shaped than the larger. See the next impression. (“White or bluish-white. Small in contrast to a larger shape perhaps. "As stated, the smaller of the two near-circular sculptures, about ten inches across, is of polished silvery metal, highly reflective. This gives it the bluish cast. It also looks whitish, and gray. The quality of light can cause these changes in color.

Those who do not construct a system cannot perceive it. Now. There is nothing at all unusual in precognitive experiences. They occur constantly beneath the level of your awareness. However there are certain conditions necessary before precognitions can arise to conscious levels, and there are definite conditions that must exist before what you call apparitions can be perceived.</td><td>所有实相系统都是由那些感知该系统的人创建或构建的。那些没有建构系统的人无法感知它。现在。在预知经验里，根本没有不寻常之事。它们一直不断在你的意识层面下发生着。但是，在预知能够出现在意识层面之前，是有某些必要条件的，而且在你所谓的幻影被感知之前，也必定存在一定的状况。</td></tr><tr><td>So-called apparitions, again, are not unusual. They are more or less constant. Many of these apparitions exist in their own system whether or not you perceive them. Some apparitions are constructed by the perceiver and are basically caused by a telepathic communication. But all apparitions are not of this nature. All apparitions however, to appear as or within the physical system, must be constructed by the perceiver in the same manner that all physical objects are constructed.</td><td>所谓的幻影，再说一次，并非罕见。它们或多或少是持续不变的。不管你有没有感知它们，这些幻影有很多都存在于它们自己的系统中。有些幻影是感知者建构的，而且基本上是心电感应沟通造成的。但是所有的幻影都不是这种性质。不管怎样，所有看起来像是物质系统或在物质系统之内的幻影，必定是感知者以建构所有实物的相同方式建构出来的。</td></tr><tr><td>This does not mean that apparitions are only the result of such construction on the part of the perceiver. The perceiver constructs the pseudo material apparition as he constructs the physical image of his contemporaries, but in, or rather and in line with telepathic data that is received by or from the consciousness whose material image is being constructed.</td><td>这并不是说，幻影只是感知者的这种建构造成的结果。感知者建构伪物质幻影的方式，和他建构其同辈物质形象的方式一样，但是，更确切地说是而且，与物质形象被建构的这个意识接收或发出的心电感应资料是一致的。</td></tr><tr><td>You recall we spoke of primary and secondary physical constructions. These classifications apply regardless of the basic nature of the consciousness that is to be materially formed. An apparition constructed as a result of telepathic data, picked up by the perceiver in message form, will be constructed by him in precisely the same manner that an apparition will be constructed that is a reflection of a survival personality.</td><td>你记得我们谈过主要和次要的物质建构。无论这个在物质上被形成的意识有何基本性质，这些分类都适用。作为感知者以讯息形式接收到的心电感应资料而造成的一个结果，已建构的幻影将会被他建构的方式正好和死后犹存人格的倒影被建构的方式一样。</td></tr><tr><td>The difference is not in construction, for the methods of construction are the same. For example, Mr. A in his bedroom telepathically picks up the thought of his brother many miles distant. Now. If he merely picks up his brother's thought, and the thought is, quote: “ I am dying. I wish I could say goodbye to my brother,” then the receiver of the message could form the apparition of the dying brother, and then perceive it in his bedroom.  This would be a secondary construction.</td><td>有别之处不在于结构，因为建构方法是相同的。例如，A先生在他的卧室里透过心电感应接收到几英里哥哥脑海的念头。现在。如果他只是接收到他哥哥的念头，而这个念头是，加引号：“我快死了。我希望我能跟弟弟说再见。”然后讯息的接收者就形成垂死哥哥的幻影，然后在他的卧室里感知它。</td></tr><tr><td>If however the dying brother made an out-of-body journey before or after death, for a last visit, then the receiver would still have to construct the apparition himself in order to perceive it. But in this case we would have a primary construction.</td><td>这是一个次要建构。然而，如果垂死的哥哥在死亡之前或之后，为了探望而进行一次出体之旅，那么接收者仍然必须自己建构幻影以便感知它。但是，在这种情况下，我们就会有一个主要建构。</td></tr><tr><td>Nothing is seen directly. You are always forming such constructions, and the methods by which this is accomplished are the same regardless of the nature of the consciousness which is to be perceived in physical terms. In all cases, if the ego consciousness is to be reached, some sense imagery is necessary.</td><td>完全没有直接看到什么。你向来都是在形成这样的建构，无论在物质上被感知的意识有何本质，完成这件事的方法都是相同的。在所有的情况下，如果要触及自我意识，一些感官意象是必需的。</td></tr><tr><td>Sense images are built up, you see, in the same manner whether or not you are trying to perceive an apple, a star, or a human being. They are built up in the same manner whether or not you want to perceive a thought that must be made physical, or the image of a consciousness that must be made physical.</td><td>无论你是想要感知一颗苹果、一个星星或一个人，你看，你都是用同样的方式建立感官意象。无论你是想要感知必须化为物质的一个念头，还是必须化为物质的一个意识形象，你都是以同样的方式建立它们。</td></tr><tr><td>You have noticed in our own work that oftentimes information will be perceived by Ruburt in terms of visual images. I do not give Ruburt the information in this manner. The images are formed from my ideas. Usually they are formed by his ideas. I try to direct his image making, but in both instances the same process of image making is involved. You can understand in fact the way in which sense images are organized much more clearly by studying instances where sense images exist without an actual object representing them in the physical universe. This shows that sense impressions are independent, you see, of objects.</td><td>在我们自己的工作上，你已经注意到，鲁柏感知的讯息经常是视觉意象。我不是用这种方式给鲁柏讯息的。意象是出自我的意念而被他形成的。通常它们是由他的意念形成的。我试着指导他创造意象，但这两种情况都涉及到同样的意象创造过程。事实上，研究在物质宇宙没有代表它们的实际物体但依然存在的感知意象这类实例，你就能够更清楚了解感知意象的组织方式。这表明感知印象，你看，是独立于物体之外的。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take your break.</td><td>你们可以休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:30.

When you are concentrating upon destructive elements, you lose on two points. You reinforce the destructive qualities by the very act of concentrating upon them, and you rob yourselves of the constructive qualities that you could be concentrating upon, and therefore that you could be reinforcing.</td><td>我不会更深入探讨这个问题，因为我们经常提到它，现在我要针对你们两位说话。当你们专注在破坏性的元素时，你们就会两头皆输。你们专注在破坏性质的行为正好强化了它们，而且你们也丧失了自己可以专注其上并进而强化的建设性质。</td></tr><tr><td>For an example, we will take your friend and her tumor. The tumor was formed by inner concentration. She feared a tumor so strongly that subconsciously she focused her energies in those directions. It existed in her mind long before it was physically constructed.</td><td>比方说，我们拿你们的朋友和她的肿瘤当例子。肿瘤是内在的专注形成的。她对肿瘤的恐惧太强烈了，因此在潜意识里把她的能量集中在那些方向上。早在它的物质建构出现之前，肿瘤存在她的心智里很久了。</td></tr><tr><td>Had she concentrated upon constructive elements, upon positive and not negative qualities, not only would the tumor itself be nonexistent, but she would have constructed a positive element in its stead. A spiritual growth, for example.</td><td>如果她专注在建设性的元素，在正面而非负面的性质上，不仅肿瘤本身不会存在，而且她还会建构一个正面元素来取而代之。例如，灵性的成长。</td></tr><tr><td>All of these matters, you see, and many more, from the considerations of health and the formation of destructive ulcers and tumors, to the construction of any simple physical object, to the construction of an apparition—all of these are in one way or another connected with inner focus and concentration.</td><td>这一切，你看，还有更多从健康问题与破坏性溃疡和肿瘤的形式，到任何简单的实物建构，再到幻影的建构——这一切在某方面都与内在焦点和注意力有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>You will in all cases attempt to construct as physical reality your inner conception of what reality is. Your physical environment and conditions are a mirror of your own basic conceptions of reality. If the environment changes it is because your inner conceptions have changed, and no smallest alteration is made within physical reality, that has not first been made within the inner self.</td><td>在所有情况下，你都会试图把你内在对实相的概念建构成物质实相。你的物质环境和状况反映了你自己对实相的基本概念。如果环境改变了，那是因为你的内在观念改变了，而且没有先在内我之中做出最小的改变，在物质实相之内是不会产产生任何变化的。</td></tr><tr><td>I wanted to mention here a subject that is at least allied. We have not touched upon it often, if at all, and it has to do with something Ruburt wondered about: Mass, or shared, dreams.</td><td>我想在这里提一个至少有关联的话题。如果有提过，我们也不常触及它，而且它和鲁柏想知道的事情有关：集体梦和共同梦。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, your physical universe is obviously composed of shared perceptions, and mass dreams would of course be of the same nature. Mass dreams are indeed a reality. They exist mainly at one particular level, and they have to do with what you may call for now, world pictures.</td><td>现在，你们的物质宇宙显然是由共同的感知组成的，而集体梦当然具有相同的性质。集体梦的确是实相。它们主要存在一个特定的层面，与你现在所谓的世界画面(world pictures)有关。</td></tr><tr><td>These help form the reality of human conditions upon your planet at any given time. Those conditions are at least partially the result of such mass dreams.</td><td>这些画面帮忙在任何既定时间于你们的星球上形成人类境况的实相。那些境况至少有一部分是这种集体梦的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take a break before our Instream material.</td><td>你可以休息一下，再来给殷斯翠姆资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:56.

Jane sat with a hand raised to her closed eyes, speaking rather slower than before. Resume at 10:06.)</td><td>(现在是进行第57次殷斯翠姆博士实验的时候了。珍坐着，一只手抬起，放在闭着的眼睛上，说话速度比之前慢了不少。10:06继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Give us a moment please.</td><td>现在。请给我们一点时间。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not know to what this refers. There is a round sun or lamp image. Has Dr. Instream been taking some sort of treatment involving a l amp, or staring into a light? Perhaps, since an office or a room is connected here.</td><td>我不知道这是指什么。有一个圆形太阳或灯的意象。殷斯翠姆博士是否正在接受某种涉及灯的治疗，或是盯着一盏灯？也许，因为这里和一间办公室或房间有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Also a connection with two. Perhaps two in the afternoon, or perhaps two treatments or visits to this place. This could refer even to an eye examination, if he had to look at a round bright object.</td><td>也和2有关联。也许是下午两点，或两次去这个地方做治疗或拜访。如果他不得不看一个圆形的明亮物体，那这甚至可能是指眼睛检查。</td></tr><tr><td>Another impression, separate from the first, with music—a concert perhaps. A third aisle. A seat to the right of the center.</td><td>另一个印象是音乐，与第一个分开——或许是演奏会。第三排走道。中间靠右的座位。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, our object. Small. He fingers it in his pocket. Something like a medal, but not round. Resembling a short squat cross in shape, but more filled in, in the center, and this portion scalloped in some manner, and inscribed. Of dark color. The object is fairly old. A metal color, somewhat of a mixture resembling gray greens, with a silverish colored tinge. A date on it. Connected with the object also an 1874 date, referring to the beginning of a tradition or establishment.</td><td>现在，我们的物件。小的。他把手指放在口袋里。有点像奖牌，但不是圆的。形状类似矮小矮胖的十字，但正中央比较饱满，而且这部分以某种方式呈扇形，还刻着字。深色。这个物件相当陈旧。金属颜色，有点像灰绿混合的颜色，带着银色色调。它的上面有日期。还有一个1874年的日期与物件有关联，指的是一个传统或体制的开始。</td></tr><tr><td>Another impression separate from the rest. Stedgewick, or Sedgewick. Something Dr. Instream has been reading. A connection with a volume, that is bound in a leather-appearing material, but softer. Brown-red in color. The edges of the pages are not white. Perhaps cream colored, and originally tinged with gold.</td><td>另一个印象与其他印象是分开的。史戴吉威克(Stedgewick)，或赛吉威克(Sedgewick)。殷斯翠姆博士在阅读的东西。与一本大部头的书有关联，用看似皮革但更柔软的材料捆住。棕红色。页面的边缘不是白色的。也许是奶油色，最初带有金色。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused at 10:20.)</td><td>(10:20，珍停顿。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, do you have an envelope for me?</td><td>现在，你有没有信封要给我？</td></tr><tr><td>(“No.')</td><td>(“没有。”)</td></tr><tr><td>We will then discuss briefly, very briefly, mass or shared dreams.</td><td>那么，我们就简短、非常简短地讨论一下群众或共同的梦想。</td></tr><tr><td>There are actually several varieties. For now we will be concerned with mass dreams that have an almost universal nature. That is, dreams that are shared at one time or another by the majority of living persons on your planet.</td><td>实际上有几个不同的种类。目前我们要来关注的是，几乎普世皆然的集体梦。也就是说，大多数在你们的星球上活着的人在某个时期共享的梦。</td></tr><tr><td>There are dreams shared by various groups for example also.</td><td>也有比方说各种不同团体共享的梦。</td></tr><tr><td>This particular kind of dream is concerned with working out certain problems concerning your physical reality, and they are usually not precognitive. They might appear precognitive if you perceived them, because many of the events contained therein will later occur in fact. They are not precognitive however, for in a large measure they bring about, or cause, physical events.</td><td>这一种梦涉及到，解决某些与你们的物质实相有关的问题，而且它们通常不是预知梦。如果你感知到它们，它们可能看起来是预知梦，因为包含在其中的很多事件事实上后来将会发生。然而，它们不是预知梦，因为在很大程度上它们引发或导致物质事件。</td></tr><tr><td>They occur, comparatively speaking, just above that layer which Jung refers to as the collective unconscious. If you could perceive these dreams then you would have a good idea of the main physical events of the future, because you would see them being born.</td><td>相对而言，它们恰好位于荣格称为集体无意识那一层的上方。如果你能感知到这些梦，那么你就会对未来的主要物质事件很有概念，因为你会看到它们的诞生。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane now took a pause lasting well over a minute. She sat quietly with her eyes closed. After she resumed her eyes began to open occasionally.)</td><td>(珍现在暂停，持续超过1分钟。她闭着眼睛静静坐着。继续之后，她的眼睛开始偶尔睁开。)</td></tr><tr><td>These are as a rule connected with significant events that affect many countries. They represent in the main deep intents, wishes and purposes. (Another long pause.) At times they have immense power to bring about shaking world changes of either beneficial or destructive nature.</td><td>这些通常和影响很多国家的重大事件有关。基本上它们代表深层的意图、愿望和目的。(再一次长时间的停顿)有时候它们拥有巨大的力量，足以引发撼动世界的变化，不管是有益或破坏性的变化。</td></tr><tr><td>(Note the way Jane reversed the order of the two words.)</td><td>(注意珍颠倒这两个词顺序的方式。)</td></tr><tr><td>One individual however is more important than you have ever dreamed, for the intensity and emotion and intent is important here. One man, passionately willing, good or evil, can overbalance, literally, a hundred men. In the dream state too, you see, leaders can be born and make themselves known. The people already know them in these mass dreams, before they are ever known in physical reality.</td><td>然而，一个个体比你梦到的更为重要，因为强度、情感和意图在这里很重要。一个男人，热情有意愿，无论善意或恶意，在实际面上可能比一百个男人更有价值。在梦状态中，你看，领导者也可能诞生并且让他们自己为人所知。他们在物质实相里为人所知之前，人们已经在这些集体梦中认识他们了。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, you may end the session or take a brief break as you prefer. (“1 guess we'll end it then. ")</td><td>现在，你可以结束这一节或短暂休息一下，随你高兴。(“我想那我们就结束吧。”)</td></tr><tr><td>My heartiest best wishes to you both. We will continue with this material at our next session, and perhaps I will answer Ruburts question. He asked why he did not dream of me. (Jane smiled, eyes open.) I do not dream of him, either.</td><td>给你们两位我最衷心的祝福。我们将在下一节继续讨论这个资料，也许我会回答鲁柏的问题。他问说为什么他没有梦到我。(珍笑了，睁着眼睛)我也没有梦到他啊。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good night, Seth.”</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 10:32.

The object was a sheet of yellow paper upon which our young fiend Don Wilbur doodled various numbers and words on the evening of Friday, April 15. I found it while cleaning up after company had left, and decided to use it for an experiment. Jane told me tonight that she didn’t remember seeing Don make it. It was produced on the evening of the unscheduled 251st session. Jane ended up physically ill after this session, which saw very strong voice effects. There were five witnesses, excluding myself.</td><td>(第49次信封实验在课间举行。标的物是一张黄纸，我们的年轻友人唐·韦伯在4月15日星期五晚上在纸上涂写各种数字和文字。我在客人离开后清理时发现它，而决定用它做实验。珍今晚告诉我，她不记得看到唐这样做。它是在第251节临时课那天晚上产生的。在声音效应极佳的这一节之后，珍的身体最终病了。不包括我自己在内，共有5个见证者。</td></tr><tr><td>( I dated and initialed the paper when I found it on April 15.

As you know, all aspects of physical reality first exist within the framework of nonobjective reality.</td><td>现在。你知道，物质实相的所有面向首先存在非客观实相的架构之内。</td></tr><tr><td>In certain areas of mass shared dreams, collective mankind deals with the problems of his political and social objective structure. The solutions which he makes within his dream reality are often, however, not the same solutions that he accepts within physical reality.</td><td>在集体共享梦的某些领域里，人类集体处理其政治和社会客观结构的问题。然而，他在梦实相之内制定的解决方案往往与他在物质实相之内接受的解决方案不同。</td></tr><tr><td>The dream solutions are held as the ideals, however. Without for example mass dreams, your United Nations would never exist. This type of mass dream is one of several varieties. It is true indeed that all dreams to some extent are shared, for the privacy that you imagine exists within them is, as Ruburt correctly supposed, an illusion.</td><td>然而，梦中的解决方案被当成是理想。比方说，如果没有集体梦，你们的联合国永远都不会存在。这种集体梦是几个不同类型之一。确实，所有的梦在某种程度上都是共享的，因为你们想像在它们之内的隐私，鲁柏说得很对，是一个幻相。</td></tr><tr><td>It is of course necessary at this stage of your development that selectivity be used, and that some standards be drawn that will effectively define apparent limitations and boundaries. The area within these limitations and boundaries you call the self. The self expands as your ability grows, as you learn to retain identity in the midst of diversity.</td><td>在你们的这个发展阶段，当然有必要加以选择，也要划定一些有效定义外显限制和界线的标准。在这些限制和界线之内的范围，你们称之为自己。在你的能力日益增长，学会在多元中维持本体之时，自己也随之扩展。</td></tr><tr><td>Practically speaking you see, if you were aware of the constant barrage of telepathic communications that do impinge upon you, it would be most difficult to retain identity. Identity would suffer if it were forced to perceive more impressions than it could effectively handle. Shared dreams are therefore well beneath awareness.</td><td>实际上来说，你看，如果你觉察到心电感应的沟通持续不断传来，而且的确影响你，那维持本体是非常困难的。如果本体被迫感知的印象多过于它能够有效处理的，那么本体就会受苦。因此，共享梦远在觉知之下。</td></tr><tr><td>Identity could be called a strong organizing characteristic that perceives impressions in definite ordered form. As identity is strengthened through experience then it automatically expands itself to add further realities which it is now able to manipulate.</td><td>本体可以被称为强大的组织特征，感知形式明确有序的印象。在本体透过经验日益强大之时，它就会自动扩展，增加更多它现在能够操纵的实相。</td></tr><tr><td>I have told you that dream reality is more cohesive than you may have supposed. Such characteristics as shared dreams go a long way to stabilize dream reality. When you dream of others they know it. When they dream of you, you know this. There would be nothing to be gained however in conscious awareness of these conditions.</td><td>我告诉过你，梦实相比你可能以为的更有凝聚力。像共享梦这类特征对稳定梦实相大有帮助。当你梦见别人时，他们是知道的。当他们梦见你时，你是知道的。然而，对这些状况有意识觉知，是不会有任何收获的。</td></tr><tr><td>This is a slight aside. Many people dreamed of Jack Kennedy’s death in advance, as you know. On one level this knowledge was available to the man himself. This does not mean that the death have to happen. It was a vivid possibility. It was also one of many solutions to several problems. While it was not the most suitable solution, it was the closest man could come at that particular time in physical reality.</td><td>这稍微离题一下。你知道，很多人在事发前梦到杰克·肯尼迪的死。在一个层面上，这个知识对这个男人自己来说是可得的。这并不是说死亡非得发生不可。它是一个强烈的可能性。它也是几个问题的众多解决方案之一。虽然不是最合适的解决方案，但在物质实相的那一个时候却是最接近的人选。</td></tr><tr><td>All events are known in advance, but still there is a selectivity that is unknown. Dreams as you know have their own electric reality, their own psychic energy, and their effect upon physical events is extremely strong. The effect is undiluted, so to speak. The emotional intensity of a dream is very seldom recalled in its full strength.</td><td>所有事件在事前都是已知的，但仍然有未知的选择。你们知道的梦有它们自己的电性实相，它们自己的心灵能量，而且它们对物质事件的影响非常强大。可以说，影响效果是没有经过稀释的。梦的情感强度很少被人全部记住。</td></tr><tr><td>Psychic action is being directed in a way not possible in the ordinary waking condition. Shared dreams present their own historic organization, for the shared memory of your race does not only include physical events, but reaches much further than this.</td><td>心灵行动以一般醒时状态中不可能做到的方式被引导着。共享梦呈现它们自己的历史组织，因为你们人类的共同记忆不仅包括物质事件，还触及到比这深远多了的地方。</td></tr><tr><td>Dreams you see are also imprinted within the cells electromagnetically. We will take a simple example, those who are not prejudiced against those races who are kept downtrodden. They dream individually and collectively of changing the situation. They act out in their dreams the various ways in which such a change about could occur. These dreams actually bring about the resulting change that will then happen in a historic manner. The very energy and direction you see of the dreams themselves will help change the situation.</td><td>你看，在电磁层面上，梦也被铭印在细胞之内。我们举一个简单的例子，那些对受到压迫的种族没有偏见的人。他们个人和集体的梦改变了这种状况。他们在自己的梦中以各种让这种变化能够发生的方式付诸行动。这些梦实际上造成由此产生的变化，然后这个变化才发生在历史上。你看，梦本身的能量和方向有助于改变现状。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:29. Jane was dissociated as usual. Her eyes began to open during the last ten minutes of the delivery, and her pace speeded up somewhat. She resumed in the same manner at 9:39.)</td><td>(9:29休息。珍像往常一样出离。在传述的最后10分钟，她的眼睛开始睁开，她的速度略微加快。9:39，她以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>You see, in the waking state you direct your energy into the manipulation and construction of objects.</td><td>你看到，在醒时状况中，你把能量投入在物体的操纵和建构中。</td></tr><tr><td>In some respects this dissipates the energy, of course. In the dream state you manipulate energy more directly. This is what you are doing of course in self-hypnosis: Rut, used for therapy, you are still trying to affect or change something physical.</td><td>当然，在某些方面，这会消耗能量。在梦状态中，你更直接地操纵能量。这当然就是你在自我催眠当中做的事；但是，用在治疗上，你仍然试图影响或改变某个物质状况。</td></tr><tr><td>In the existence of what you call the radio stars you have energy that is being manipulated more directly than you can imagine—energy knowing itself highly individualized. You have self structures so intense that they are able to handle an infinite variety of impressions, share them, use them, and still retain individual identities.</td><td>在你们所谓无线电的存在中，你们拥有比你们想像还要直接被操纵的能量——高度个体化、认识它自己的能量。你们拥有的自己，结构如此严密，以至于它们能够处理各种各样数不尽的印象，分离、利用它们，并且仍然保有个人本体。</td></tr><tr><td>You understand that the radio stars are merely the projection of something else. That is, your scientists with their instruments perceive only the appearance that these structures take when they fall within the physical system. This has nothing to do with the nature of their own reality, for you cannot perceive that in any direct manner.</td><td>你明白无线电星只不过是其他东西的投射。也就是说，你们的科学家用他们的仪器只能感知这些结构落入物质系统之内的外观而已。这和它们自身实相的本质毫无关系，因为你们无法以任何直接的方式感知那个本质。</td></tr><tr><td>You cannot for that matter perceive yourselves directly, but only through the sense apparatus which has been adopted by the self. You perceive directly psychological experiences, but you do not perceive these in their undiluted form. You protect yourselves and automatically sift out what is too vivid or intense at any given time.</td><td>因此你们无法直接感知自己，只能透过自己所采用的感官。你们直接感知心理经验，但你们并没有感知它们未经稀释的形式。你们保护自己，而在任何时候自动过滤掉太生动或强烈的经验。</td></tr><tr><td>You do not even perceive sense data with a third of the vividness of which you are capable. This has to do again with the self-protection used. The self does not perceive any impressions, you see, which are so vivid that it could be overwhelmed. As the self learns then it allows greater and more intense impressions.</td><td>你们甚至没有用到你能力所及的三分之一来感知感官资料。这同样又与自我保护有关。你看，自己并没有感知到任何非常生动到可能让人无法招架的印象。随着自己的学习，它也能够接受更大而且更强烈的印象。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take your break.</td><td>你可以休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(“No, I'm all right.” I had been sneezing, and Jane paused at 9:49.)</td><td>(“不，我没事。”我一直在打喷嚏，珍在9:49停了下来。)</td></tr><tr><td>If you are comfortable then we shall continue briefly.</td><td>如果你觉得舒服，那我们就再继续一会儿。</td></tr><tr><td>In most instances the full and uninhibited use, even of the outer senses, could sweep an insecure self into fragments. The strength and intensity of any impression cannot be stronger or more intense than the perceiver.</td><td>在大多数情况下，即使不加以限制地充分运用外在感官，也可能把一个没有安全感的自己震成碎片。任何印象的力度和强度都不可能比感知者更有力或更强大。</td></tr><tr><td>Full and uninhibited use of even the outer senses would lead you to inner reality. Usually only a strong and disciplined self, a well-structured identity, can perceive in this manner, and then only occasionally.</td><td>即使不加以限制地充分运用外在感官，也能引导你们进入内在实相。通常只有强大而有纪律的自己，一个结构完整的本体，才能以这种方式感知，然而只是偶一为之。</td></tr><tr><td>Full operation of inner and outer senses, you see, in your present stage of development as a race, would be blinding, as you can see in your reading of drug experiences.</td><td>你看，在你们这个种族现在的发展阶段，内在感官和外在感官的全面运作令人盲目，就像你阅读吸毒经验看到的那样。</td></tr><tr><td>An occurrence only remotely approaching this can be disastrous. Not because it is basically undesirable, for such an experience has the greatest potentials for development of the self. Such experiences can be disastrous simply because the self structure is not yet strong enough to assimilate and contain the intensity of the experience. In many cases dream experiences, as I have mentioned, are much more vivid and intense than waking experience. You do not even remember the majority of these. But the inner self is more flexible, you see, than the ego, and it can therefore contain greater intensities without undue alarm.</td><td>一个只是远远近似这种情况的事件就可能是一场灾难。不是因为它基本上是不受欢迎的，而是因为这样的经验对于自己的发展具有最大的潜力。这种经验可能是灾难，因为自己的结构还不够强大，无法吸收和承受经验的强度。在很多案例中，正如我提到过的，梦经验比醒时经验更为生动、强烈。你甚至不记得其中的大多数。但是，你看，内我比自我更有弹性，因此它可以承受更大的强度而不会过度警觉。</td></tr><tr><td>We will now take our break.</td><td>现在我们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:59. Jane was dissociated as usual. Her pace had been good, her eyes opening often.</td><td>(9:59休息。珍像往常一样出离。她的速度很好，眼睛经常睁开。</td></tr><tr><td>(It was now time for the 58th Dr. Instream experiment.

I have the impression of a swift, perhaps sudden turn to the left, I believe in an automobile at an intersection. No accident, bur another car somehow involved. (A long pause.) A school nearby. I believe in the afternoon.</td><td>我不知道这指的是什么。我有一个快速，也许是突然转向左边的印象，我相信是十字路口的一辆车。没有车祸，但另一辆以某种方式参与其中。(长时间停顿)附近的一所学校。我相信是在下午。</td></tr><tr><td>Now for our object. Rectangular, yet it rolls, or can roll. Rather light in weight, as say paper or cardboard, resembling a spool of some kind. But larger than a spool of thread. It is not an esthetic but a functional object. Perhaps it is a roll of paper.</td><td>现在是我们的物件。矩形，但它滚动，或能够滚动。重量很轻，譬如像纸或纸板，类似某种线轴。但比线轴更大。它不是一个欣赏用而是功能性的物件。也许是一卷纸。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, separate impressions. An affair at which ten people were present. Or an affair that was held at ten. Some kind of lists discussed there. Also a specific connection with a kitchen, and with one tall man with a mustache, who has a child, a daughter.</td><td>现在，个别的印象。一场有10个人在场的活动。或在10点举行活动。在那里讨论的某种清单。也和一个厨房，以及一个留着胡子的高个子男人有关联，他有一个孩子、一个女儿。</td></tr><tr><td>(Pause at 10:15.)

You were earlier speaking of reincarnation, and Ruburt has just finished reading The Three Faces of Eve.</td><td>现在。你们早些时候谈到轮回转世，而鲁柏刚读完了《三面夏娃》(The Three Faces of Eve)。(编注：《三面夏娃》是根据真实故事。涉及到对人格分裂症患者的关注与治疗。夏娃经常莫名其妙地做事，事后浑然不知。她甚至差点勒死女儿，因此被送去治疗。医生发现夏娃正常时属于谨小慎微的女人，并为她的“病”感到痛苦和羞愧。而每当夜晚或某些特定时刻，她又会自称是夏娃(这是她娘家时的名字)，出入于酒吧歌厅，穿着前卫，举止轻佻，对自己之前作为夏娃的想法感到鄙视和不屑。医生对其催眠治疗。无意中催生出了夏娃的第三重人格，她自称为Jane，不仅神志清醒，还对其他两种人格非常了解。Jane告诉医生，她们就好像是一直在一起的三个灵魂，共同栖身于一个肉体，每当控制肉体的人格变弱时，其余两个中最强势的一个便会控制肉体，做自己想做的事。——引自于网络。)</td></tr><tr><td>We shall tie these two subjects together. The book should make one point plain: Identity, despite all appearances to the contrary, does not reside primarily in the ego. Social identity may possibly there reside, but the basic identity does not.</td><td>我们要把这两个主题结合在一起。这本书应该说明一点：尽管表面看来全部相反，但是本体主要并不是存在自我中。社会本体可能存在那里，但基本本体不是。</td></tr><tr><td>The four faces of Eve all represented various ego manifestations of one inner identity. The course of the ego is a precarious one, and any number of potential egos exist within any identity. The Three Faces of Eve is an excellent title for the book, since the ego may quite legitimately be compared to the face that the identity turns toward objective reality, or the living mask that it dons.</td><td>夏娃的四张面孔都代表了一个内在本体的各种自我表现。自我的路线是不稳定的，任何本体之内都存在任何数量的潜在自我。《三面夏娃》对这本书来说是绝佳的书名，因为自我可以非常合理地比作本体转向客观实相的那张面孔，或是它戴上的那张活生生的面具。</td></tr><tr><td>The authors made several excellent points, without however carrying the main point in any actuality. They conceive of the psychological structure as a gestalt, dominated by the ego, formed by various needs and potentialities. When the dominating ego relaxes its control for any reason or becomes weakened, then according to their concept any one of the subsidiary groups may take over.</td><td>作者提出了几个绝佳的重点，但是没有说出真正的要点。他们想像心理结构是一个完形，由自我主导，由各种需求和潜力所形成。当主导的自我基于任何原因放松它的控制或变得虚弱时，那么根据他们的观念，任何一个次要团体都可以接管。</td></tr><tr><td>They do not know however where identity does reside, and consider it the result merely of organized perceptual patterns. Subsidiary potential egos can then seize upon and use the organisms sensual and perceiving apparatus. They do mention, the authors, that this can sometimes be the result of necessity. The next strongest takes over when the captain is down, so to speak, so that the whole can survive.</td><td>然而，他们并不知道本体存在于何处，而以为它仅只是有组织的感知模式造成的结果。然后，次要的潜在自我就可以抓住并利用有机体的感官和感知装置。他们确实提到，这有时可能是必要的结果。可以说，当首领垮台时，下一个最强的就会接管，以便整体可以存活下来。</td></tr><tr><td>But identity is much more than this, and basic identity, while using the perceptive abilities, is not that dependent upon them. It is true that the personality is a gestalt, and that every identity has any number of potential egos. It is also true that on occasion one potential ego will take over from another. But this is all highly simplified, for the ego structure is not one thing, but a changing, never constant, actually quite informal grouping of psychological patterns. Each ego uses and interprets the organisms perceiving apparatus in a way that in the overall is characteristic and distinctive.</td><td>但本体不仅仅是这样而已，基本的本体虽然使用感知能力，却不依赖它们。没错，人格是一个完形，每个本体都有数量不一的潜在自我。有时候，一个潜在自我会接替另一个自我，这也是真的。但这全都是高度简化的说法，因为自我结构并不是一样东西，而是一种变动不居、永不固定、实际上相当非正式的心理模式分组。每个自我都以一种整体而言有其特色又截然不同的方式使用和解读有机体的感知装置。</td></tr><tr><td>Phis characteristic way of interpreting perceived data, and of reacting to it, is not as constant as it appears to be however. The stability and illusion of permanence is highly misleading. The four manifestations of personality all belonged to one identity, and this is perhaps the main point missed. For if the authors say that oftentimes a subordinate or potential ego will rake over control when necessary in order to insure the survival of the whole, then this implies a decision that has been made; and who has made it?</td><td>然而，解读感知资料并对其作出反应的这种有其特色的方式，并不像表面看起来那样恒久不变。恒久不变的稳定和幻相极为误导。人格的四种表现形式都属于一个本体，这也许就是那个阙漏的要点。因为如果作者说，次要或潜在自我往往会在必要时接管控制，以确保整体的生存，那么这意味着有人做了一个决定；是谁做的呢？</td></tr><tr><td>The authors ignore this question. The decision has been made on the part of the basic identity. It is not dependent upon any particular ego structure, but it is dependent upon an ego structure for its existence within a physical universe.</td><td>作者忽略了这个问题。决定是基本的本体做的。它不依赖任何特定的自我结构，但是为了它在物质宇宙之内的存在，它会依赖一个自我结构。</td></tr><tr><td>It can therefore, without loss of its basic integrity, change egos when such a change becomes necessary. Now. In some cases this may cause inconvenience and considerable psychological difficulties, but when such an instance occurs it is because the ego structure that is being deposed was not carrying out the main aims or goals of the identity which originally gave it that envied position of dominance.</td><td>因此, 在不失去其基本完整性的情况下，当这样的改变有其必要时，它就会改变自我。现在。在某些案例中，这可能会造成不便和相当大的心理困境，但是当这种情况发生时，是因为被废除的自我结构没有实现主要的目的或目标，本体最初之所以赋予它令人羡慕的主导地位，就是为了那些目的或目标。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take your break, and we shall continue.</td><td>你可以休息一下，我们再继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26. Jane said she was well dissociated for a first delivery. Her pace had picked up and her eyes, very dark, had been open much of the time.</td><td>(9:26休息。珍说她第一次传述时充分出离。她的速度已经恢复，她的眼睛非常黑，大部分时间都是睁开的。</td></tr><tr><td>(She resumed in the same manner but with a slightly stronger voice at 9:36.)</td><td>(9:36，她以同样的方式继续，但声音比较有力一点。)</td></tr><tr><td>While identity and consciousness are regarded as the result of primarily physical processes, then the nature of personality will never be understood.</td><td>只要本体和意识被视为主要是生理过程的结果，人格的本质就永远不会被了解。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner self is always in the process of trying to perfect the nature of that ego which it has adopted. The ego, as you know, is never the same. It bears indeed the stresses that result from daily encounters with physical situations, but it also reaps the rewards that are involved.</td><td>内我总是一直在努力让它采用的那个自我具有完善的本质。你知道，自我永远不会是一样的。它确实承受着每天遇到种种物质情况所带来的压力，但它也获得包含在其中的奖励。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner self chooses from its available potential personalities the one that it finds most adequate. Sometimes it simply makes an error, for the inner self is not a perfected thing, any more than the ego is. But identity does exist, and the ego is but a pseudo identity formed for utilitarian reasons, and as such it is of course a part of the basic identity from which it springs.</td><td>内我从它可用的潜在人格中选出它觉得最适合的一个。有时它只是弄错了，因为内我不是一个完美的东西，自我也一样不是。但本体确实存在，而自我只是出于实用目的而形成的伪本体，因此它当然是它从中产生的基本本体所属的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>It has its own possibilities of development and achievement. This should not be forgotten, and all potential egos have, also, their own possibilities. The inner self or identity must express itself through its ego in order to manipulate within physical reality. The inner self is composed of all the potential egos that compose it, but it is more than the sum of these.</td><td>它有自身发展和成就的可能性。这一点不应该忘记，而且所有潜在自我也都有它们自己的可能性。内我或本体必须透过它的自我来表达它自己，以便在物质实相之内进行操纵。内我是由组成它的所有潜在自我组成的，但它不仅仅是这些自我的总和。</td></tr><tr><td>Now these potential egos, you see, made up of various potentials and needs and abilities, these pooled resources that belong to the inner identity, did not simply spring into existence. They are the result of psychological experience gained in past lives.</td><td>现在这些潜在自我，你看，是由种种不同潜力以及需求和能力组合而成的，这些集聚的资源属于内在本体，所以它们并不仅仅是突然跃入存在。它们是前世的心理经验造成的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>The personality structure does not make sense unless such past experience is taken into consideration. Potentials do not simply appear, they evolve. I have told you that the most minute portion of energy possesses consciousness and has its own identity. This identity of itself is never annihilated. It may form into new gestalts but the identity is retained.</td><td>除非把这种过去世的经验考虑在内，否则人格结构没有意义。潜力不仅仅是出现，它们也在演进。我告诉过你，能量最微小的部分都有意识也有它自己的本体。它自己的这个本体永远不会被消灭。它可能会形成新的完形，但本体继续留存。</td></tr><tr><td>The energy that composes personality therefore consists of an inconceivable number of separate identities. These separate identities form what we call the inner self, which retains its individuality even while the energy that composes it constantly changes. There are continual groupings and regroupings, but basic identities are always retained. The potential egos within any given identity therefore retain their own individuality and self-knowledge, regardless of their relative importance in the order of command.</td><td>构成人格的能量因此是由数量多到无法想像的个别本体的。这些个别的本体形成我们所谓的内我，即使构成它的能量不断变化，它仍然保有它的个体性。有连续的分组和重组，但基本本体始终留存。因此，不管它们在指挥链当中的相对重要性如何，任何既定本体之内的潜在自我都保留它们自己的个体性和自知。</td></tr><tr><td>These potential egos at one time or another will have their chance, as dominant egos, in this existence or in another reincarnation. They represent the overall potentials of the whole identity in respect to physical existence. The identity has in other words latent abilities which it will not use within the physical system, but all of the latent ability ever available lies within the original identity.</td><td>这些潜在的自我在某一时间或其他时间都会有机会，在这一世或另一个转世里，担任主导的自我。它们代表整个本体在物质存在方面的整体潜力。换句话说，本体具有它不会在物质系统之内使用的潜在能力，但所有可用的潜在能力都存在原版的本体之内。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:57.

Del was about 48 when the picture was taken in the backyard of their home in Santa Monica, California, and Maxine was 38 or 39. Within six months Maxine was dead from cancer.

A connection with something suitable for an occasion.” In the photo Maxine is dressed up, including white hat and gloves, and wears a large corsage on the left lapel of her dark-colored suit.

This is why, after a losing an Elmira school board election last year by about too votes she decided to make one last try, which won her a seat on the board by a large margin. "Children and education are my two main concerns," said Mrs. Berry this morning in her office at the County Welfare Department. The 34. year-old Mrs. Berry is a protective caseworker in the Child Welfare Division of the department, a position she has held for five years. Her interest in education began when she started working in the Welfare Department. • • • “ I ran into so many children whose problems seemed to center in education,'' she said. "So many of them have problems In school and problems at home at the same time." Mrs. Berry learned of her victory soon after the polls closed at 9 p.m. “ I didn't believe it." said the slim, attractive caseworker. " I bad decided against running because it was such a physical strain the last time. But I felt I should lose at least second time before giving up.” She credits her friends, and the know-ledge that she gained in last year's campaign, with her success this time. "This time I knew what I wanted,” she said. Posters were distributed and a limited mail campaign to about 6,100 home* in the Eastside, Southside and Northside "paid off," she feels. Friends also helped by volunteering to take voters to the polls. Mrs. Berry plans to spend the time before she assumes office July I In learning more about the work of the board. " I plan on listening and learning and discussing various problems. I fed that I'm capable of intelligently evaluating a situation and f plan on voicing my own opinion," Mrs. Berry said. • • • "In accepting the position, I am laying f will represent the whole school district and f mean it. I'm not thinking in just one direction. But I'm going to mike sure that everyone is protected and everyone is considered.” Based on personal observation, she baa become concerned about "the obvious lack of interest some teachers have for some children. "I'm not saying that they're not doing their jobs, nor that the schools aren't well run — I know that certain children present problems—but there are some children who just need a little more interest and a little extra help,” she said. Lack of interest on the part of parents U another concern. "If the parents don't care, there is little a teacher can do." She will be particularly concerned to see that "all of the children being educated have the best teachers in all of the schools.” "There is some feeling that this board Is represented by people of the highest level of living . . . the people who have never personally experienced problems. I'm sure they're concerned about them but I wonder U it's their main concern." • • • Mrs. Berry is not the first woman on the board. Serving with her will be Mrs. Boyd Spots. But she is the first Negro on the board. "Being a first doesn't faze me at all," she said. " I suppose I was the first in Child Welfare. I don’t think of it one way or another."

This is simply because you insist upon considering reincarnation in the light of time theories that are themselves incorrect. You must instead consider reincarnation in the light of what you know of the spacious present.</td><td>我承认，转世似乎确实有这样的含义。这只是因为你们坚持根据本身不正确的时间理论来思考转世。反之，你们必须根据你们对广阔现在的了解来思考转世。</td></tr><tr><td>Because you are obsessed with the idea of time as past, present and future, you are forced to think of reincarnations as strung out one before the other, and indeed we speak of past lives simply because you are used to the time sequence concept. What you have of course, loosely speaking, is something like the developments narrated in The Three Faces of Eve. You have various dominant egos, all part of an inner identity, dominant in various existences. To make the concept understandable to you it is convenient to speak of past and future reincarnations.</td><td>因为你们沉迷于过去、现在和未来的时间观念，所以不得不把转世想成是一个接一个排成一列，事实上我们之所以说过去世，只是因为你们习惯时间顺序的概念而已。当然，从松散的角度来看，你所拥有的就像“夏娃的三面”所述的发展。你有各种主导的自我，是内在本体的一部分，在各种存在中占主导地位。制作这个概念你可以理解，过去和未来的转世都很方便。</td></tr><tr><td>In actuality you see, these separate existences occur simultaneously. It is only the ego who makes the time distinction. The various existences are not perceivable by you, or rather they are not perceivable to the ego. In a basic manner, as you know, the past, present and future exist at once in the spacious present.</td><td>事实上，你看，这些个别的存在同时发生。区分时间的只有自我而已。你感知不到各个存在，或者不如说，同时存在自我感知不到它们。基本上，你知道，过骈、现在和未来同时存在于广阔的现在之中。</td></tr><tr><td>A hundred and forty-five B.C., a hundred and forty-five A.D., a thousand years in your past and a thousand years in your present—all exist now.

You are forming both past, present and future experience simultaneously. Events appear to you however in sequence, therefore it is difficult to explain many matters to you, because they must be given in bits and pieces.</td><td>过去的经验不会导致当下的经验。你正在同时形成过去、现在和未来的经验。事件按照顺序在你面前出现，所以，很难向你解释很多问题，因为它们一点一滴给出。</td></tr><tr><td>When it is said that certain characteristics from a past life influence or cause present patterns of behavior, such statements, and I have made some of them, are grossly simplified simply to make certain points clear.</td><td>有人说，来自前世的某些特性影响或导致现在的行为模式，这样的陈述，虽然我说过一些，但都只是为了阐明某些要点而大加简化的说法。</td></tr><tr><td>The whole self or identity is aware of the experiences of all the egos, and since one identity forms these egos there is bound to be some similarities between them, and characteristics. The material that I have given you on reincarnation in the past is quite valid, particularly for working purposes, but it is a highly simplified version of what actually occurs.</td><td>全我或本体对所有的自我有过的经验是有觉知的，而且，因为一个本体形成这些自我，所以它们之间必然存在一些相似之处的特性。我过去给你的转世资料是非常有效力的，特别是在工作目的上，但它却是实际发生之事的高度简化版。</td></tr><tr><td>If you take The Three Faces of Eve, in which actually four egos were involved, and imagine each of these egos taking over, so to speak, in completely separate existences, in your past, present and future, then you may come somewhat closer to the true nature of reincarnation.</td><td>如果你以《三面夏娃》为例——其实有4个——想像一下，在完全独立的存在之中，在你的过去、现在和未来之中，这些自我的每一个，可以说，接管了，那么你可能就会更接近转世的真正本质。</td></tr><tr><td>These four personalities existed however in one physical lifetime. Now to an observer whose time concept was still further segmented, and slowed down in comparison to your own, then theoretically within his time system the four personalities would indeed appear to be four separate existences in fact. In the same manner, you see, several manifestations of one identity appear to you to be stretched out in serial form within a successive time framework.</td><td>然而，这4个人格存在实际的一生当中。现在对于一个时间观念仍然进一步细分，而且与你们自己的时间观念相比速度缓慢的观察者来说，那么在理论上，这4个人格在他的时间系统之内看起来确实是4个不同的存在。以同样的方式，你知道，一个本体的几种表现形式在你们看来则是在连续的时间架构之内延伸开展。</td></tr><tr><td>Obviously however this analogy only carries us so far. You will say, “The four egos belonging to Eve all belonged to one physical body, but in the reincarnational process we are faced with the issue of several bodies, each one discarded and experiencing physical death.”</td><td>不过，这个类比显然最远只能带我们到这里。你会说：“属于夏娃的4个自我都属于一个肉体，但在转世过程中，我们却面对几个身体的问题，每个身体都被丢弃而经历肉体的死亡。”</td></tr><tr><td>Now, I will tell you the nearly unbelievable. There was not one shared body in the case of the four Eves. There were four separate bodies.</td><td>现在，我要告诉你几乎令人无法置信的事情。在4个夏娃的案例中，没有一个共享的身体。而是有4具单独的身体。</td></tr><tr><td>After the first shock this should come as no surprise. As you know, the physical body is itself never the same, and the atoms that compose it appear and disappear constantly while the appearance of permanency is retained. Such a process, and a natural one, took place in the case of Eve.</td><td>在最初的震惊之后，这应该不足为奇。你知道，肉体本身永远不会相同，构成它的原子会不断出现和消失，同时保留永久的外观。在夏娃的案例中，这样一个过程，而且是一个自然的过程，发生了。</td></tr><tr><td>But as the personalities alternated they took over the organic processes so completely that while the body appeared, generally speaking, to be the same, it was not the same.</td><td>但随着人格的交替，它们完全接管了有机过程，因此一般来说，虽然身体看起来相同，但它是不一样的。</td></tr><tr><td>It should be remembered here that two personalities were allergic to nylon and two were not. Obviously two personalities made such changes in the physical organism that the allergy was brought on. The organism was physically changed and affected. Even though one personality took over for an hour, still for that hour the physical organism itself was a different one.</td><td>这里应该要记住，两个人格对尼龙过敏，两个人格没有。显然，两个人格在发生过敏的物质有机体当中，做了这样的改变。有机体在物质上发生了变化也受到了影响。即使一个人格接管了一个小时，但是在一个小时里，物质有机体本身是另一个不同的物质有机体。</td></tr><tr><td>It is interesting to note also that these personalities did alternate, and all were in existence at once, so to speak, even though only one was dominant at a given time. In the same way all so-called past personalities are present in your now, but not dominant. Obviously also any future reincarnations are present for those who have other lives still to live in your terms.</td><td>值得注意的是，这些人格确实是交替出现的，而且可以说，这些人格全部都是同时存在的，即使在既定的时间里只有一个人格占据主导地位。同样地，所谓过去的人格全部都存在你的当下，但不是主导。显然，对于那些按照你们的说法还有其他生命依然活着的人来说，任何未来的转世也都存在。</td></tr><tr><td>There is simply the simultaneous expression of a prime identity or inner self within the physical system. There are as you know other systems.</td><td>有的纯粹只是一个主要本体或内我在物质系统之内同时存在的表达形式而已。你知道，还有其他系统的存在。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:56.

As stated it is the top half of the first page of chapter five of the book on dreams that Jane is writing. This was the first draft.

The studio is actually a glass-enclosed back porch, second story, converted to year-round use.</td><td>(“一个框架，似乎是木制的，有着像杆子一样的线条。”我们相信这个资料因为后来给的“高耸的壁架形状”资料而强化了，也相信它指的是我的工作室，用作物件的那一页手稿是在那里写的。早上我在外面工作时，珍说会用这间工作室。她的桌子面对五扇排成一列的窗户，又高又窄，有小窗格。这间工作室其实是一个用玻璃围住的后门廊，在二楼，为了全年都能使用而重新装潢过。</td></tr><tr><td>(As she sits at her desk Jane looks out and down to the grass of the backyard below. The view is high and quite pretty. To her left is the kitchen roof of the apartment below us, but this is to the side and does not obstruct the view.

Helga Anderson, a good friend, has anemia. She is the wife of Ernfred Anderson, a sculptor who was director of the art gallery where Jane worked part-time for several years. In the chapter five connected with the object, Jane uses a dream of Ernfred's to make a certain point.</td><td>(“与贫血的关联导致鲁柏想到荷尔嘉·安德森，或与艺术家或艺术品的关联。”珍认为赛斯在这里设法要她说在艺术上的努力，意思是指谈那本书，和物件有关。荷尔嘉·安德森，一位好朋友，患有贫血症。她是厄恩福瑞·安德森[Ernfred Anderson]的妻子。安德森是一位雕塑家，曾担任艺术画廊的总监，珍在那里兼职过几年。在与物件有关的第五章当中，珍用厄恩福瑞的梦来表达某一个论点。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A note.” Either Seth saw the folded object as a note in itself, or he refers perhaps to Janes penned notes on the object.</td><td>(“一张纸条。”赛斯看到折叠的物件本身是一张纸条，或者他也可能是指珍写在物件上的笔记。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The month of April.

There can be extensions here: Not completed could refer to the whole first draft of chapter five, or to the whole dream book itself. Abo, perhaps, initiation could be linked to the suggested experiments for the reader to try, as mentioned in the headings. Janes idea is that this data refers to the dream book itself being started but not completed.</td><td>(“刚起头，未完成。”这个物件是珍谈梦那本书的第五章初稿前半页，因此是某个刚开始或起头但未完成的东西。这里可能还有延伸的关联；未完成可能指第五章的整分初稿，或一整本谈梦的书本身。也许，就像开头说的，刚起头可能与建议读者尝试的实验有关联。珍的想法是，这个资料是指谈梦的书本身刚起头但未完成。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The color purple, "Jane said this is speculation: She wears a certain purple sweater her mother made for her on days when the studio is chilly in the mornings. She wears no other sweater in the studio; it is, also, too large to wear publicly.

Discussing this subject, Jane mentions that fire helped primitive man “keep the beasts away, " etc.</td><td>(“和一只动物有关联。”奇怪的是，在珍谈梦那本书第五章有几次提到动物。在这一章的前半部，珍用了“马前的运货车”这个句子，而赛斯稍后提到马。这一章的标题是梦象征与文化。讨论这个主题，珍提到火帮助原始人“驱离野兽”等等。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The words unholy alliance come to me here.” The whole of chapter five, from which the object comes, concerns the close relationship between dreaming and waking life. We see the idea of alliance here, but not unholy particularly. Seth might have been spoofing us a bit, or it could be a slight distortion. My notes indicate nothing out of the ordinary in Jane's delivery at the time.</td><td>(“这里我想到邪恶联盟这些字。”作为物件出处的整个第五章是关于做梦和醒时生活之间的密切关系。我们在这里看到联盟的概念，但不是特别邪恶。赛斯可能哄骗了我们一下，不然它可能是一个轻微的扭曲。我的笔记显示，当时珍的传述丝毫没有异样。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A selection, or something offered from which selections may be made.” The six headings to the chapter five, shown on the object.</td><td>(“一个决策或做出决策可能会得到的东西。”第五章的六个标题，显示在物件上。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A star shape.

Jane believes that she quite possibly made the diagram on the same day she typed up page 80, which was used as envelope object. Page 112 was used in the final version of chapter five, fortunately, and so was not thrown away. I had not seen the diagram before. It is one Jane made to help her see clearly certain points involving the whole self, and waking and dreaming states. There was much handwritten copy beneath it. Jane located the diagram immediately after this session. She said it is the only one she made for the dream book; she has the habit of making many notes on her manuscript, but very few diagrams of this kind.</td><td>(“一个星形。再一次，某个圆形的东西，辐条向外，但相当突出。”珍一读过赛斯的资料，立刻想到这个图[下图]。它在谈梦那本书初稿第112页背面。珍相信她很可能在打第80页的字那一天画了这个图，第80页就是当作信封物件那一页。幸好，第五章最后的定稿用了第112页，所以没有被扔掉。我没见过之前的图。珍画这张图来协助她看清楚涉及全我，以及醒时和做梦状态的某些点。它下面有很多手写的副本。珍在这一节之后立即找到了这张图。她说这是她为谈梦那本书制作的唯一一张图；她习惯在她的手稿上做很多笔记，但很少有这样的图。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Something disturbed.

Perhaps a game connection.” Games figure prominently in chapter five of the dream book. To make some of her points in the chapter Jane uses a recurring childhood dream of her own. This dream involved the large playground she visited often in waking life, across the street from her school in Saratoga Springs, NY. There were many kinds of games to be indulged in at the playground in waking life. In addition, in her recurring dream Jane kept recreating a series of games at the playground, in a section where there were none. There is more to the dream, but enough is said here to make the game connection.</td><td>(“正方形。也许和一个游戏有关联。”游戏在谈梦那本书第五章占据了显著位置。为了表明她的一些观点，珍在这一章用了她自己小时候经常一做再做的一个梦。这个梦涉及她在醒时生活中经常去玩的大游乐场，它位于纽约州撒拉托加温泉市她的学校对面。在醒时生活中的游乐场，有很多种游戏可以尽情地玩。此外，在她反复出现的梦中，珍一直在游乐场上一个根本没有的区域重新创造一系列游戏。这个梦不只是这样，但这里说的就足以确定和游戏的关联。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A small round circle suggesting a postmark.” In the upper right-hand corner of the object is the page number, enclosed in a circle, and in approximately the position of an envelope postmark.</td><td>(“意味着邮戳的一个小圆圈。”在物件的右上角是页码，用圆圈包住，大约在信封邮戳的位置上。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Red or blue.” I am not sure, but when taking the data from Seth I wondered whether this could be connected to the postmark data. At times it is difficult to tell. I used a period after the word postmark however in the notes, so consider the red and blue separately. Jane made the notes on the object with a dark blue or gray pen that gives the impression of dark blue. She said she felt red or blue refers to the fact that she uses two different pens in correcting manuscript—a red one and a blue one; but we are not sure.</td><td>(“红色或蓝色。”我不确定，但是从赛斯接收这个资料时，我怀疑这有没有可能和邮戳资料有关联。有时很难分辨。不过，我在注释里的邮戳一词后面加了句点，所以把红色和蓝色想成是分开的。珍用一支深蓝色或给人深蓝色印象的灰色笔在物件上写笔记。她说她感觉红色或蓝色是指她使用两支不同的笔来修正手稿这个事实——一支红色和蓝色；但我们不确定。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with a high ledge shape, as one connected with a roof, or lookout from which one can look down and away.” See the interpretation of the “framework" data on page 148. As stated, the manuscript page used as object was written by Jane in the studio at the back of the apartment. The studio is a second-floor converted porch with two sides made up of five windows each. Jane sits at her desk facing the row of windows to the west; from there she has an excellent view of the backyard and the street beyond. She “looks down and away” at grass and flowers, etc., and to her left, not obstructing her view, is the porch roof of the apartment on the ground floor.</td><td>(“和一个高耸的壁架形状有关联，就像和屋顶连接在一起，或一个人可以从上面俯视远方的那一种。”赛斯的解读，如上所述，用作物件的那一页手稿是珍在公寓后面的工作室写的。工作室是改建过的二楼门廊，两侧各有五扇窗户。珍坐在她的书桌前，面向西边的一排窗户；从那里她可以看到后院和街道的绝佳景色。她“往下俯视远方”的草地和鲜花等等，而且在她的左边，没有挡住她的视像，是一楼公寓的门廊。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with four people, one of them disheveled,” I wanted to ask Seth questions about this data but did not get the chance.

See the recurring childhood playground dream, mentioned in the data dealing with the interpretation of “a game connection.” This dream, over a period of a couple of years during her childhood, had a powerful effect upon Jane; she has talked about it ever since I have known her. In the dream Jane constructed a set of games, involving physical apparatus like swings and jungle gyms, in a section of the playground where in physical life none existed. The morning after one of these dreams Jane would hurry to the playground before going to school, to investigate to see if by chance there were swings, etc., in that particular section of the playground. There were none. She would then have to hurry to school; most often she would arrive late, and breathing hard, and disheveled. She remembers this clearly.</td><td>(珍相信“衣冠不整”这个词在这里指的是她自己。参见反复出现的儿童游乐场之梦，在处理“和一个游戏有关联”资料的解读中有提到。这个梦出现在她童年的一两年期间，对珍有强大的影响；自从我认识她之后，她就一直在谈论它。在梦中，珍在游乐场的一个区域建构了一套游戏，包括秋千和攀登架等实体设备在内，但是在物质生活中，那个区域根本不存在。做了这些梦的一个之后，早上珍会在上学之前赶到游乐场，调查看看在游乐场那个特定区域会不会碰巧有秋千等等。一个都没有。然后她就得赶紧到学校去；往往，她会迟到，喘着大气，衣衫不整。她清楚记得这件事。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Fourteen,” We speculate: Not seeing any other connections offhand, we count fourteen lines of type on the object, including the chapter headings.</td><td>(“14”我们推测: 乍看之下，没有看到任何其关联，所以我们数了物件上的打字，包括章节标题在内共14行。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Also a small screen.” It took Jane two days to make the connection here, and when she did it was very vivid. At the end of the session she said she’d had no images while giving the envelope data. Association a couple of days later reminded her that she had indeed had one mental picture—that of a small television screen, and quite clearly. These images can be difficult to recall, particularly on the spur of the moment, and Jane has had other instances where they came to mind some time after the session.</td><td>(“还有一个小荧幕。”这里珍花了两天时间寻找关联，而且当她找到时，它非常生动。在课结束时，她说她在给出信封资料时没有任何意象。一两天之后，联想让她想起，她的确有过一个心像——一个小型电视荧幕，而且非常清楚。这些意象可能很难想得起来，特别是在当下未经思索的情况下，珍还有过其他几次在课后的某个时间才回想起来的例子。</td></tr><tr><td>(The TV screen entered the data because Jane used an analogy in the first couple of pages of chapter five of the dream book, involving a 7 V screen; she mentioned it quite extensively on two pages. The analogy does not show on the half page used as object. It begins on the bottom half of the same page—but not in the first draft of chapter five of the dream book. It is found instead in the second draft; rewriting the chapter, Jane then inserted the television screen analogy to help make some points clear.</td><td>(电视荧幕之所以进入资料中，是因为珍在梦书第五章的前两页用了一个比喻，和一台电视荧幕有关；她在两页里用了很大篇幅谈到它。这个比喻不在用作物件的半页上。它始于同一页的下半部——但不是在梦书第五章的初稿上。而是在第二回的草稿上；后来在重写这一章的时候，珍插入电视荧幕的比喻，以便理清一些观点。</td></tr><tr><td>(Two days after the session Jane found herself reading over her second draft of chapter five.

(A long pause; Jane was very restless.) The dream, I believe, was a part of a series of three dreams, the other two yet to come. He was also involved in some astral travel. This is not unusual, for the inner self frequently leaves the body when the body sleeps.</td><td>在使用字词的时候，真相永远不可能看起来完全没有扭曲，这样说是对的，因为字词本身掩盖的几乎和提示一样多。(长时间停顿。珍非常不安)我相信，这个梦是3个梦一连串的梦之一，其他两个梦还没来。他还投入某种灵体旅行。这并不罕见，因为内我经常在身体睡觉时离开身体。</td></tr><tr><td>All Ruburt could remember of his dream was the knowledge that many of mankinds most cherished conceptions about reality are completely false. He was shown a multidimensional diagram of reality as it exists in terms of the spacious present, and in terms of qualities that represent dimensional points.</td><td>鲁柏只记得他在梦中认识到，对于实相，人类最珍爱的观念有很多完全是错的。他看到一张多重维度图，显示出就广阔的现在而言以及就代表维度点的性质而言存在的实相。</td></tr><tr><td>In the diagram for example, each star would represent a moment point in another system. It appears as matter within your system, from your viewpoint, and exists as matter within your system. But it exists as something entirely different, you see, within another system.

Since you observe matter, it obviously has a reality. However, these heavenly bodies appear as something entirely different, you see, within other systems.</td><td>你知道，对于它们，你们只能感知到物质，因为你们自动把所有资料转化为物质模式，原因出在你们自己的感知性质上。既然你们观察到物质，那它显然有一个实相。但是，这些天体在其他系统之内，你知道，看起来是完全不同的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>What you call dimensions represent states in which reality is perceived. You perceive reality in three dimensions, and you have a glimpse of reality in a fourth dimension. There are many dimensions however in all directions. These heavenly bodies represent moment points in other systems. As they are projected into your system however, they are only perceived in terms of matter.</td><td>你们所谓的维度代表实相被感知的状态。你们感知三维里的实相，你也一瞥在第四维度里的实相。然而，所有的方向都有很多方面。这些天体代表其他系统中的片刻点。不过，当它们被投射到你们的系统时，你们只有在物质方面感知到它们。</td></tr><tr><td>(See the 149. 152nd sessions for material on moment points, and sessions 246250, and 254, for material on quasars.)</td><td>(片刻点的资料见第149、152节，类星体的资料见第246至250节和第254节。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, I will tell you further that these dimensions merely represent various capacities of consciousness.

You form the system within which you operate. The heavenly bodies for example are moment points to other systems. They actually exist as such within your system if you could perceive them as such.</td><td>你们必须用你们自己的说法诠释它们。你们形成你们在其内运作的系统。例如，天体对其他系统而言是片刻点。如果你们能够如实感知它们，那么它们实际上就如实存在你们的系统之内。</td></tr><tr><td>It is easier then to say that they appear as matter when they are projected into your system, but this is not precisely correct. Nothing but the various stages of consciousness separates the dimensions, you see, but the separation is quite effective nonetheless.</td><td>当它们被投射到你们的系统时，它们看起来是物质，这样说是比较容易，但并不完全正确。你知道，虽然划分维度的除了意识的各个阶段之外，没有别的，但是这种划分还是非常有效。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I suggest your break.</td><td>现在我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>We hinted, incidentally, of something along these lines in our sessions on moment points.

I was about to ask Seth who gave Jane the data in the dream when break came.</td><td>(9:22休息，珍像往常一样出离。她的速度加快相当多，她的眼睛也开始经常睁开，到了点了支烟也喝了点酒的程度。她说，要是上述资料重现她的梦所代表的含意，那她在意识上倒是一点都不记得了。我正要问赛斯，在梦中给珍资料的是谁，就到了休息时间。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed with her eyes closed and at a slower pace at 9:33.)</td><td>(9:33分，珍闭着眼睛继续，速度较慢。)</td></tr><tr><td>Other systems exist within the same space occupied by your own, but you cannot perceive them.</td><td>其他系统存在你们自己的系统占用的相同空间之内，但你无法感知它们。</td></tr><tr><td>The inhabitants of some of these systems can perceive you. All of these inhabitants of various systems cannot perceive you however.

Even using your mathematics, you can still only conceive of reality in certain terms. It is difficult to put this into words. I must reemphasize this. Your mathematics still deals, comparatively speaking, with a very slim area. (Jane smiled, eyes wide open and very dark.)</td><td>虽然你们的数学概念非常有限，但作为片刻点，天体符合了某些数学原理。即使用你们的数学，你们还是只能在某些方面设想实相。这很难用语言表达。我必须再强调这一点。相对来说，你们的数学还是仅限于非常窄的领域。(珍笑了，睁大眼睛，颜色非常深。)</td></tr><tr><td>You can conceive of a fourth-dimensional cube, for example, but you cannot conceive of a fourth-dimensional thinking process. You cannot conceive of a fourth-dimensional psychological structure. You cannot think (smile) in fourth-dimensional terms.

The primary personality must therefore deal with a much larger number of perceptions, while still maintaining its identity. It manipulates in a larger number of dimensions, until it is able you see to handle many, not just one, of its own egos at any given “time”—and you may put time in quotes—while still maintaining its own inner stability and individuality. It takes on more roles, you see, and the psychological structure becomes more complicated as the inner self becomes sure enough of itself to admit ever more stimuli, while still retaining its own core.</td><td>在每个维度中，内我开始处理实相的更多面向。因此，主要人格必须和数量多出很多感知打交道，同时还得维持它的本体。它在更多的维度里进行操纵，你晓得，直到它在任何既定的“时间”——你可以把时间放在引号中——都能够处理它自己的很多个而不仅仅是一个自我，同时仍然维持它自己的内在稳定性和个体性。你知道，它承担了更多的角色，而且在内我变得足够自信而容得下更多刺激，同时仍然保有它自己的核心之时，心理结构也变得更加复杂。</td></tr><tr><td>This material is as important as any I have given to you, and we shall be concerned for a while with personality structures as they exist within other dimensions.</td><td>这个资料和我已经给你的资料一样重要，我们会关注存在其他维度之内的人格结构一阵子。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take your break.</td><td>你可以休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:52.

The chapter from which the object came contains many other such references also.</td><td>(“和一个尝试，或某个试过的东西有关联。你晓得，我不知道这是就判断而言的试验，还是就尝试而言的试验。”我们认为这是指企图。梦书的第五章包含了几个建议读者尝试的实验，有醒时和做梦状态及其交替等等。在物件本身，尝试这个词在珍的笔记上使用了两次，和读者企图操纵梦有关。作为物件出处的那一章也有很多地方提到这个词。</td></tr><tr><td>(Since these “try" or trial references are included on the object itself we see a similarity in the above impressions and the “markings and dates” data Seth gives in the 257th session.

Perhaps in black." My own idea is that this refers to the recent death of a priest Jane knew in her teens. A couple of weeks ago she received notice of his death, with a photo of him edged in heavy black. There is a connection between the priest.

Writing of Father Ryan now reminds us that he died of leukemia—also a blood disorder as anemia is. Note that Seth merely said that anemia reminded Jane of Helga Anderson; Helga is not given as Seth’s impression. Perhaps the anemia impression is a distortion of leukemia. However, we think Jane's Helga impressions and the interpretations leading to the envelope object and the dream book in general, to be legitimate.</td><td>(这里有一个注释：见前节我们对赛斯的印象“贫血”所做的解读，以及珍把这个印象和我们的朋友荷尔嘉･安德森连结在一起。现在写到莱恩神父让我想起他死于白血病——和贫血一样也是血液疾病。注意，赛斯只是说贫血让珍想起荷尔嘉･安德森；荷尔嘉并不是赛斯给出的印象。也许贫血印象是白血病的扭曲。然而，我们认为珍的荷尔嘉印象以及导向信封物件和整本梦书的解读是合理的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Some lines of printed or written material.” Father Ryans mourning photo contained printed type on the back.

Perhaps in black, "on page 157, describing the physical relation between the school, the priests home quarters, and the playground. The relation with building here is a little unusual. Although the building was directly across the street from the playground there was no access between the two.

The effect is like an inkblot, except that the quality and texture of the paint is much superior as far as charm goes; this particular hand-ground pigment, which I make myself by heating a certain Italian earth color, has a texture like fine cement or roughened, stone. Since it is a heavy-bodied pigment, it was built up in spots on the object as much as '/<.> of an inch thick. The whole pattern was made up of lines and white spots which do not show very well in my tracing.

The ego can be taught however. What it cannot experience directly it can still understand to some degree if it is given the proper information. There is no reason for Ruburt to be surprised at Mr. Fox’s thesis on dreams and out-of-body experiences.</td><td>你存在很多维度中，然而自我对这样的存在毫无觉知。不过，自我是可以教的。如果给它适当的资料，它某种程度还是能够了解无法直接体验的东西。对福克斯先生那篇梦和出体经验的论文，鲁柏没有理由感到惊讶。</td></tr><tr><td>(Astral Projection, by Oliver Fox.)</td><td>(《灵体投射》[Astral Projection]，奥利弗·福克斯[Oliver Fox]著。)</td></tr><tr><td>Our own material has hinted in these directions very strongly. Ruburt is quite familiar with such excursions, though egotistically he is only slightly aware of a few of them. There is no need to get too complicated, so we shall deal only with fourth and fifth-dimensional personality structures for now.</td><td>我们自己的资料非常强烈提示这些方向。鲁柏对这种远足相当熟悉，但就自我而言，他只对其中几个略有觉知而已。没有必要讲得太复杂，所以我们现在只讨论第四维度和第五维度的人格结构。</td></tr><tr><td>You do exist therefore in both of these dimensions. The ego cannot participate directly in such experience. There is a compliance on the part of the ego, however, that allows it to step aside so that it does not block inner awareness of other-dimensional existence. It is difficult, but not impossible, for the ego to correlate the information gained. Dreams involve as you know several dimensions. The dream state itself is a very loose term, for there are several layers of consciousness within it, and there is no limit to the states of consciousness that can be achieved, ideally speaking.</td><td>因此，你确实存在于这两个维度中。自我不能直接参与这样的经验。然而，在自我的部分，顺从是有的，使它能够让开，才不会阻碍内在对其他维度存在的觉知。自我要和获得的资讯产生关联，虽然困难，但并非不可能。你知道，梦涉及多个维度。梦状态本身是一个非常含糊的说法，因为在它之内有几层意识，而且在理想的情况下，可以达到的意识状态是没有任何限制的。</td></tr><tr><td>Practically speaking however there are usually only three. Your own fourth-dimensional personality structure obviously operates constantly. One of the main purposes and goals of the whole self is to become aware of all such existences, and to correlate them into an identity structure.</td><td>不过，实际上来说，通常只有三个。你自己第四维度人格结构显然不断持续运作。全我的主要目的和目标之一，就是对这样的存在全部都有觉知，并让它们与一个本体结构结合在一起。</td></tr><tr><td>The Fox experiments are quite valid, with some changes that you will make, I imagine. At one level of the dreaming state it is possible for you to recognize and align yourself with that portion of yourself that is aware of itself within fourth-dimensional reality. You have both occasionally learned to take our waking consciousness into the dream state, and here Fox is correct, for you must start at this point.</td><td>我想像，加上你做出的一些改变，福克斯的实验是相当有效力的。在做梦状态的某个层面上，你有可能认识你自己对它在第四维度实相之内有觉知的那一部分，并且调整自己到与它一致。你们两人偶尔都学着把我们的醒时意识带入梦状态中，而在这里福克斯是对的，因为你必须从这一点开始。</td></tr><tr><td>You begin to manipulate the dream state, or rather you begin to manipulate yourself within dream reality, which is something different. It is an entirely new environment. In ordinary dreaming, without the awareness of usual waking consciousness, perception of dream reality is limited and instinctive. All in all you get along quite well. You are like a child in objective reality. When you learn to take waking awareness into the dream condition, you are reaching adolescence, so to speak.</td><td>你开始操纵梦状态，或不如说你开始在梦实相之内操纵你自己，这是两回事。它是一个全新的环境。在普通的做梦状态中，没有平常的醒时意识，所以梦实相的感知有限而且是凭着本能。总而言之，你的进展相当顺利。在客观实相中，你就像一个孩子。当你学会把醒时意识带入梦状态叶，可以说，你正在迈入青春期。</td></tr><tr><td>When you reach adulthood, following our analogy, then you will learn to be successful in manipulating dream reality as you now manipulate objective reality. For if you create your dreams, you also create your objective environment. The dream reality is as real and actual as physical reality, but it can be changed you see by you, as physical reality can be changed.</td><td>当你成年之后，按照我们的比喻，你就学会成功地操纵梦实相，就像你现在操纵客观实相一样。因为，如果你创造自己的梦，那么你也创造自己的客观环境。梦实相与物质实相一样真实和实际，但你看，你可以改变它，就像你可以改变物理实相一样。</td></tr><tr><td>It is training for fifth-dimensional existence, and you will be working with an odd kind of time, to you. You will be forming new gestalts of experience, using past, present and future as a painter chooses his colors, combining them into various paintings.</td><td>这是为第五维度存在所做的训练，你会和一种在你看来很奇怪的时间合作。就像画家选择他的颜色，把它们组合成各式各样的绘画一样，你也利用过去、现在和未来，形成新的经验完形。</td></tr><tr><td>You are at the early stages of this development, but it will come. These realities within the dream universe may be created by you, but they are as actual as the piece of cake that you eat, or the poison that you may swallow. As your common sense protects you in the physical universe, so you must use discretion as you progress into the manipulation of dream objects.</td><td>你处于这个发展的早期阶段，但它会来的。在梦宇宙之内的这些实相可能是你创造的，但它们和你吃的蛋糕，或你可能吞下的毒药一样真实。就像你的常识在物质宇宙中保护着你一样，在你进行梦物件的操纵时，也必须慎重斟酌。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:25. Jane was “out" as usual, she said. Her pace had picked up considerably. Her eyes had begun to open, and she had lit a cigarette and sipped wine. She resumed in this more emphatic manner at 9:32.)</td><td>(9:25休息。珍说，她像往常一样“出去”。她的速度加快相当多。她的眼睛已经开始睁开，而且她也点了一支烟，喝了一点酒。9:32分，她以这种更加强调的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now there are points of difference indeed in fourth-dimensional reality for you, as there are points of reference in objective reality.</td><td>现在，对你而言，在第四维度实相里确实存在不同点，就像在客观实相里有参考点一样。</td></tr><tr><td>We have already explained the ways in which agreement is reached within physical reality, as to the dimensions of objects. In somewhat the same manner agreements are reached in fourth-dimensional reality.</td><td>我们已经解释过在物质实相中就物件的维度达成协议的方式。在第四维度实相里，也是以有几分相同方式达成协议。</td></tr><tr><td>For example, Mr. Foxs dream meetings were quite valid. This is what happens in such a case. Those who agree on such a meeting within dream reality must have certain abilities developed. They must be capable of taking waking consciousness into the dream state. They must be able to manipulate within it. Each of them therefore constructs, you see, the dream location at which the have agreed to meet, a point not thought of by Ruburt's Mr. Fox.</td><td>例如，福克斯先生的梦中聚会就非常有效力。在这种情况下，事情就是这个样子。那些在梦实相之内同意这样一个梦中聚会的人必须具备一定的能力。他们必须能够把醒时意识带入梦状态中。他们必须能够在其中进行操纵。因此，他们每个人都建构了，你知道，他们同意见面的梦中地点，这是鲁柏的福克斯先生没想到的一点。</td></tr><tr><td>When you are considering dream reality, it is easier for you to understand that you construct the reality therein. You find it more difficult to understand the same thing about physical reality.</td><td>当你在思考梦实相的时候，你比较容易了解你在其中建构实相。你发现了解物质实相的同一件事反而比较困难。</td></tr><tr><td>As a result however, you are somewhat less apt to accept dream reality as actual, and I must tell you that it is, particularly since you are considering certain experiments along these lines. You are in control as long as you realize that you are in control.</td><td>不过，结果是你比较不容易接受梦实相是真实的，而且我必须告诉你，它是真实的，特别是因为你正在考虑沿着这些方向进行某些实验。只要你发觉你在控制，你就是在控制。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. There are indeed portions of dream reality that you yourself may not have constructed, but that are constructed by others. You recall that in physical reality you can only perceive your own constructions, as a rule. Now, my clear friends, this does not apply to dream reality.</td><td>现在。确实有些部分的梦实相，可能不是你自己建构的，而是其他人建构的。你记得，在物质实相里，你通常只能感知自己的建构。现在，我亲爱的朋友们，这并不适用于梦实相。</td></tr><tr><td>This is indeed an important point.</td><td>这确实是一个重点。</td></tr><tr><td>Form of any kind, and there is form within dream reality, form is first of all a potential form, existing within psychic energy. The potential form therefore exists long before it’s physical materialization, as far as your physical perceptions are concerned.</td><td>任何一种形式，而且在梦实相之内也有形式，形式首先全都是一种潜在的形式，存在心灵能量之内。因此，就你们的物质感知而言，潜在形式早在它的物质显化之前就已经存在。</td></tr><tr><td>Physically therefore the house that you will live in within five years may not exist, in your terms, now. It may not have been built yet, therefore physically you do not perceive it. Such a house however does have form, and does exist within the spacious present.</td><td>因此，在物质上，你在5年内将要居住的房子，按照你们的说法，现在可能不存在。它可能还没有盖好，因此在物质上你感知不到它。然而，这样一间房子确实有形式，也确实存在广阔的现在之内。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. In certain levels of dream reality forms that you do not as yet perceive as physical, dfl exist. They can be seen and perceived. In certain dreams you do perceive them. Within dream reality you can come in contact with many other kinds of reality with which you do not ordinarily have to deal.</td><td>现在。在某些梦实相的层面上，你还没有感知它是物质的形式确实存在。它们是可以被看见，也可以被感知的。在某些梦中，你的确感知到它们。在梦实相之内，你可以接触到其他很多你平常不需要面对的实相。</td></tr><tr><td>A year ago this information would not necessarily be practical for you. With the experiments you have in mind it becomes highly practical. Your abilities are developed enough so that these experiments should be successful, with some additional training that can only be achieved through experience. Some hints from me will help, but I would like to give you some idea, you sec, of what to expect.</td><td>一年前，这个资讯对你来说不一定实用。有了你想要做的实验之后，它变得非常实用。你已经发展出足够的能力，因此有了只能透过经验而达到的一些额外训练，这些实验应该会成功。我的一些提示会有帮助，但是对于能够预期什么，你知道，我想要让你有一些概念。</td></tr><tr><td>When you are only operating within physical reality, you have a fairly simple set of rules to serve you. Within dream reality you are much freer. The ego is not present. The waking consciousness, dear friends, is not the ego. The ego is merely a small portion of waking consciousness. The ego is the portion of waking consciousness that deals with physical manipulation.</td><td>当你只在物质实相之内运作时，你有一套相当简单的规则可以用。在梦实相之内，你更加自由多了。自我是不在场的。醒时意识，亲爱的朋友们，不是自我。自我只不过是醒时意识的一小部分。自我是醒时意识处理物质操纵的那一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>Waking consciousness is taken into the dream state, but the ego is not. The ego would immediately falter, and cause immediate failure and catastrophe. What you will meet in your experiments are varieties of conditions, and until you have learned the control it may be difficult to distinguish between them. Some you can manipulate, some you cannot.</td><td>醒时意识被带入梦状态，但自我没有。自我会马上退缩，而造成立即的失败和灾难。你在实验中会遇到各式各样的状况，在你学会控制之前，可能很难区分它们。有些你能操纵，有些你不能操纵。</td></tr><tr><td>Some dream locations will be of your own construction. Others will be of constructions quite strange to you. They will belong to other dimensions entirely, and you may blunder into them. You are in a basic manner, you see, outside of your own system when you attempt to bring your waking consciousness into the dream state.</td><td>一些梦地点将是你自己的建构。其他的地点对你来说很陌生。它们完全属于其他维度，你可能会在无意间发现它们。当你试图将你的醒时意识带入梦状态时，你看，你基本上是在你们自己的系统之外。</td></tr><tr><td>You are in the process of evolving another form of consciousness, that is individually. This will be new to you to some large extent. In the past any such experiences have been accidental on your parts. I have been involved in some instances with Ruburt on such occasions.</td><td>你们正在发展另一种形式的意识，而且是个别发展。在很大程度上，这对你们来说是新的。在过去，任何这类的经验都是你们意外遇到的。在这样的情况下，我曾参与鲁柏的一些事件。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I was not dreaming of him, and he was not dreaming of me. I was simply leading him rather gently into new dimensions. When he is ready to embark he will do so. He cannot push himself in this direction, for the whole self sets ups safeguards. You are both however nearly ready.</td><td>现在，我没有梦见他，他也没有梦见我。我只是循序渐进地把他带进新的维度里。当他准备出发时，他就会出发。他不能把他自己往这个方向推，因为全我设置了防护罩。无论如何，你们两位都准备好了。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I do not like the term astral bodies, simply because of the sometimes weird connotations connected with the phrase. There is a kind of idea, or mental body, a counterpart in many ways, but not always, to the physical body, which is the structure the self takes in what you may call for now fourth dimension.</td><td>现在，我之所以不喜欢灵体这种字眼，只因为有时候这种说法会和奇怪的内涵连在一起。有一种意念或心智体(mental body)——在很多方面，是肉体的一个对等物，但并非总是如此——是自己在你此时可称之为第四维度的实相采用的结构。</td></tr><tr><td>Certain dream experiences are valid out-of-the-body experiences, in that you do indeed travel in this mental vehicle. It does have a form, somewhere between matter and no matter.</td><td>某些梦经验是有效的经验，因为你确实在这种心智载体中旅行。它的确有一个形式，介于物质和非物质之间。</td></tr><tr><td>In physical existence usually you simply do not perceive it. There is a psychic structure also that has a form. This is the self as it appears within what you may call for now fifth-dimensional reality, but it does not exist at all in terms of matter. On occasion you travel in this form.</td><td>在物质存在中，通常你根本感知不到它。还有一种具有形式的心灵结构。这就是在你此时可称之为第五维度实相之内出现的自己，但就物质而言，它根本不存在。有时候你会以这种形式旅行。</td></tr><tr><td>There is more I want to say here. However you had better take your break for our Instream material.</td><td>这里我还有很多想说的。但是，为了我们的殷斯翠姆博士资料，你最好休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:59. Jane said she was well dissociated. Seth was giving her the material so fast that she had trouble keeping up with it; her delivery had been so fast I had barely managed to keep up with it, in turn. Her eyes had opened often; her voice had been good, her manner emphatic, with few pauses.</td><td>(9:59休息。珍说她完全出离。赛斯给她资料的速度如此之快，以至于她难以跟上；她的传述速度之快，结果我也几乎跟不上。她的眼睛经常睁开；声音很好，语多强调，很少停顿。</td></tr><tr><td>(It was now time for the 63rd Dr. Instream experiment. Janes pace now slowed as she sat with a hand to her closed eyes. Resume at 10:05.)</td><td>(现在是第63次殷斯翠姆博士实验的时候了。现在珍坐着，一只手放在闭着的眼睛上，她的速度慢了下来。10:05继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, give us a moment please for our Instream material. We will give an object shortly.</td><td>现在，请给我们一点时间处理我们的殷斯翠姆资料。我们很快就会给出一个物件。</td></tr><tr><td>I have the impression of a name, I believe Severn, S-e-v-e-r-n. I do not know to what it refers. There seems to be a hill here also. Perhaps a person named Severn lives on a hill. Now, the object is some sort of a chain. Widely woven, rather than one with small spaces in it. The object is reminiscent of paper chains made by children, with wide loops, and of many pastel colors.</td><td>我有一个名字的印象，我相信是瑟弗恩(Severn)，s-e-v-e-r-n。我不知道它是指什么。这里似乎还有一座小山。也许是一个名叫瑟弗恩的人住在一座小山上。现在，物件是某种链条。编织的洞眼很宽，而不是里面都是小空间的一条链条。</td></tr><tr><td>The object does not belong to Dr. Instream, but was borrowed, and has a strong connection with a woman. Still, it seems to be mechanical, rather than for example a jewelry chain. It has a mechanical use, and perhaps a connection with two boxes, rather small in themselves, which are raised and lowered or moved, by the chain.</td><td>物件让人想起小孩子做的纸链，洞眼很宽，有很多种柔和的粉色。这个物件不是属于殷斯翠姆博士，但是被他借用，而且和一个女人有很大的关联。不过，它似乎是机械用的，而不是饰品用的链条。它具有机械用途，可能和两个盒子连在一起，这两个盒子本身相当小，透过链条而升高、降低或移动。</td></tr><tr><td>There are two round objects connected with it also, perhaps ball bearings, made in Japan. The object may also be connected with the initials B, S, or S, B, though I do not believe these represent a persons initials.</td><td>还有两个与之相连的圆形物件，也许是日本制造的滚珠轴承。这个物件也可能和首字母B、S或S、B有关联，但我相信它们不是代表一个人的姓名缩写。</td></tr><tr><td>Also a date, 1937. Other impressions, not connected with the object: A misuse. Dr. Instream believes that something is being misused. A connection here with a framework of associations having to do with psychology. And a misfit.</td><td>还有一个日期，1937年。其他印象，与物件无关：滥用。殷斯翠姆博士相信某个东西被滥用。这里和一个心理学相关的联想架构有关联。还有不合适。</td></tr><tr><td>A distant connection with two children, girls, I believe relatives. If they are not twins then they look very much alike, or they are two of a kind in some way.</td><td>和两个孩子、女孩有遥远的关联，我相信是亲戚。如果她们不是双胞胎，那么她们就是看起来非常相像，或她们在某一方面是同一类型的两个人。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have an envelope for me?</td><td>你有没有信封要给我？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes.”</td><td>(“有。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused at 10:16 without opening her eyes. She took the envelope for our 54th experiment, pressed it to her forehead for a moment and then lowered it to her lap. Her left hand remained raised to her face.)</td><td>(10:16，珍停了下来，没有睁开眼睛。她拿了第54次实验的信封，把它按压在额头上，一会儿之后再将它放在大腿上。她仍然举起左手，放在脸上。)</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment, please. These are impressions.</td><td>请给我们一点时间。这些都是印象。</td></tr><tr><td>Dark printed matter. A square object, perhaps a small square shape at the top center of the object, balanced by another shape at the bottom center.</td><td>深色的印刷品。一个正方形的物体，可能是物件顶部正中央的小正方形，由底部正中央的另一个形状加以平衡。</td></tr><tr><td>A film connection, black and white. A decoration, or something memorized, as four score and seven years ago... That is, a phrase known to many, and rather cliché.</td><td>和电影有关联，黑白电影。一个装饰，或某个被记住的东西，就像87年前之类的……也就是说，一个众所周知的句子，而且是老生常谈。</td></tr><tr><td>The square shapes again, now, as in small patterns.</td><td>现在，又是正方形，就像小型图案那样。</td></tr><tr><td>Connection with an image of Ruburt. Black and white again rather than color. A connection with the early 1960s.</td><td>和鲁柏的一个意象有关联。又是黑白的而不是彩色的。和1960年代早期有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>A forthright statement, numbers, perhaps a room number. This leads Ruburt to think of Oswego and your stay there. A connection with a federation of some sort. A connection with a man, not yourself, perhaps with your landlord.</td><td>一个直率的陈述，数字，也许是房间号码。这让鲁柏想到奥斯威戈以及你在那里待过的事。和某种联合会有关联。和一个男人，不是你自己，或许是和你的房东有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have any questions?</td><td>你有没有任何问题？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Do you think the object is a photograph?’’)</td><td>(“你觉得这个物件是一张照片吗？)</td></tr><tr><td>The question is not a good one. (Jane smiled.</td><td>这不是一个好问题。(珍笑了。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Then can you say something more about the decoration?”)</td><td>(“那么，你能不能多说一些和装饰有关的事？)</td></tr><tr><td>No more than I have said. If the object is not a photograph, it is closel connected. I have the impression of a black and white photograph.</td><td>能说的，我都说了。如果物件不是照片，也和照片有密切的关联。我有一张黑白照片的印象。</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment, please...</td><td>请给我们一点时间。</td></tr><tr><td>With a block or blocks, as rocks or steps of stone. (Jane gestured, her eyes still closed.) Also a connection with a building that is not seen from the front but from the side, perhaps from a verandah.</td><td>和一个状物或许多块状物有关联，像岩石或石阶之类的。(珍比了手势，她的眼睛仍然闭着。)也和一栋建筑物有关联，不是从前面，而是从侧面，可能是从阳台看到它。</td></tr><tr><td>Something overturned. The feeling of a fluid dark color, broken by white shapes that appear like blocks. Perhaps some connection with a pond or pool shape. The object marked in the middle of the back, in pen or pencil.</td><td>某个被翻倒的东西。感觉是一种在流动的深色，被看似块状的白色形状打破。也许和一口池塘或池塘形状有些关联。物件的背面中间有笔或铅笔写的标记。</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps J B and a date. I do not get the feeling that the object has to do with the immediate present, in that it was not a part of your experience, directly.</td><td>也许是J B和日期。我没有感觉到物件和立即的当下有关，因为它不是你直接的经验之一。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:29. Jane was dissociated as usual. Her eyes had remained closed through both experiments. She said that Seth had felt like giving many impressions.</td><td>(10:29休息。珍像往常一样出离。在两次实验中，她的眼睛从头到尾一直闭着。她说赛斯想要给很多印象。</td></tr><tr><td>(As soon as she opened the double envelopes, Jane said the object looked like a man to her, with either horizontal edge uppermost, and that she thought this impression had given rise to the photograph data. See the tracing on page 162, and the description of the object on page 163. This marked the end of the session for all practical purposes as far as Seth was concerned. Jane and I made the connections we could and did not ask Seth to elaborate.</td><td>(一打开双层信封，珍说这个物件在她看来就像一个男人，不管哪一个水平边朝上都一样，她认为是这个印象引出了照片资料。见前面的描摹图，以及物件描述，就赛斯来说，这代表为了所有实际的目的而举行的课即将结束，珍和我尽我们所能找出关联，没有要求赛斯详细说明。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Dark printed matter.” As stated, the pigment used on the object is quite dark, a burnt gray brown, but it is not black. Jane's impression of it, I noted, was that it was darker to her than to me. I don't know whether Seth uses printed here to mean an ink applied to paper or newsprint, or just some other substance applied to a surface as in the case of the object.</td><td>(“深色印刷品。”如前所述，物件上使用的颜料非常深，一种焦黑的灰褐色，但不是黑色。我注意到，珍对它的印象是，在她看来比在我看来还要黑。我不知道赛斯这里用印刷这个字眼是指一种用于纸张或报纸的墨水，或像物件这类情况，只是其他某种用在表面上的物质。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A square object, perhaps a small square shape at the top center of the object, balanced by another shape at the bottom center.” Throughout the data Seth keeps attempting to refine this shape or block image, with some success. Although none of the shapes on the original object are square, they do give the impression of being balanced one upon another. Any object produced like the envelope object will give a feeling of balance, no matter what the design, as long as both halves are printed or impressed in fill. On the original many small white interstices show that are not visible on the quick tracing. It seems Seth had a correct impression.</td><td>(“一个正方形的物件，可能是物件顶部正中央的小正方形，由底部正中央的另一个形状加以平衡。”在整个资料中，赛斯不断尝试琢磨这个形状或块状的意象，而且有了一些成果。虽然在物件原版上，没有一个形状是正方形，但它们确实给人一种彼此相互平衡的印象。任何像这个信封物件那样产生的物件，无论设计如何，只要印刷或压印完整的两个半边，都会给人一种平衡的感觉。在原版上看得到很多白色的小间隙，是在快速描摹图上看不到的。似乎赛斯有一个正确的印象。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A film connection, black and white. "As stated Jane at once thought of a man when she saw the object, and this she thinks led to the film connection. It comes up again, as does the black and white data. To Jane the color of the pigment on the object is quite dark.</td><td>(“和电影有关联，黑白电影。”之前提过，当珍看到这个物件时，立刻想到了一个男人，而她认为电影的关联是因此而来的。它又出现了一次，就像黑白资料那样。物件上的颜料在珍看来颜色很深。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A decoration,” The object is a decoration.</td><td>(“一个装饰”，物件是一个装饰。</td></tr><tr><td>(“or something memorized, as four score and seven years ago... That is, a phrase known to many, and rather cliché.” We don t know where this impression came from, and are quite puzzled by it.</td><td>(“或某个被记住的东西，就像87年前之类的……也就是说，一个众所周知的句子，而且是老生常谈。”这种印象来自哪里，我们不知道而且也很困惑。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The square shapes again, now, as in small patterns. "Seth’s refinement here is to the point. The original object contains a multitude of fine patterns made by the rough paint when I pressed the folder paper together. It is very charming; the patterns are almost like the veins in a leaf. Flecks of white scattered throughout also.</td><td>(“现在，又是正方形，就像小型图案那样。”赛斯的字斟句酌在这里是重点。原版包含了大量精细的图案，是我把纸对折压住，由粗糙涂料制成的。它非常迷人；这些图案几乎就像一片叶子的叶脉一样。白色的斑点也遍布其上。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with an image of Ruburt. Black and white again rather than color. A connection with the early 1960s. "Again, Jane thinks the dark pigment on the object gave rise to this data, with the date perhaps referring to the year a picture of herself was taken.</td><td>(“和鲁柏的一个意象有关联。又是黑白的而不是彩色的。和1960年代早期有关联。”再一次，珍认为是物件上的深色颜料引出了这些资料，其中的日期可能是指她一张照片的拍摄年份。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A forthright statement, numbers, perhaps a room number. This leads Ruburt to think of Oswego and your stay there. A connection with a federation of some sort.” Again, this data puzzles us. The object has no connection with Oswego, NY. Jane has used federation, and words like before’re large buildings such as post offices, etc., so it seems that here federation refers to the college at Oswego, where Dr. Instream teaches.</td><td>(“一个直率的陈述，数字，也许是房间号码。这让鲁柏想到奥斯威戈以及你在那里待过的事。和某种联合会有关联。”再一次，这个资料让我们感到困惑。物件与纽约州奥斯威戈没有关系。珍以前用过联合会和类似的字词，描述邮局等大型建筑物，所以看来这里的联合会是指奥斯威戈的大学，殷斯翠姆博士在那里任教。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with a man, not yourself, perhaps with your landlord.” The paint blot on the object reminded Jane of a man, which could give rise to the man data here. However I am connected with the object since I made it.</td><td>(“和一个男人，不是你自己，或许是和你的房东有关联。”物件上的颜料渍迹让珍想到一个男人，这可能引出了此处的男人资料。无论如何，因为我创作了这个物件，所以我和这个物件是有关联的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The question is not a good one.”Just for kicks, I asked Seth if he thought the object was a photograph. This because of the numerous photo and man references in the data. At this time, of course, before Jane had seen the object, I had no idea that it would remind her strongly of a man, and hence possibly give rise to the photo data.</td><td>(“这不是一个好问题。”只是为了好玩，我问赛斯他是否认为这个物件是一张照片。这是因为资料中多次提到照片和男人。当然，此时，在珍看到这个物件之前，我完全不晓得它会让她强烈地联想到一个男人，因此可能引出照片资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(“No more than I have said. If the object is not a photograph, it is closely connected. I have the impression of a black and white photograph.” Presumably because of the reasons cited above. My second question asked for elaboration on the decoration data, and resulted in some more information.</td><td>(“能说的，我都说了。如果物件不是照片，也和照片有密切的关联。我有一张黑白照片的印象。”大概是因为上面提到的原因。我的第二个问题是要求详细说明装饰资料，结果得到了更多资讯。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Give us a moment, please... With a block or blocks, as rocks or steps of stone.” This block or rock or stone data could be connected to the data in the paragraph just above this one; although Seth took a long pause in between. At any rate it seems that the texture, the rough stone like feel and appearance of the pigment on the object, could have given rise to the rock or stone impressions which in turn could conjure up the step data and so lead to the idea of a photo.</td><td>(“请给我们一点时间……和一个块状物或许多块状物有关联，像岩石或石阶之类的。”这个块状物、岩石或石头资料可能和这一段前面段落里的资料有关联；虽然赛斯在两者之间停顿很久。无论如何，物件上的颜料质感，那种像石头的粗糙触感和外观，可能给人岩石或石头的印象，进而想到台阶资料，再从而产生照片的想法。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Also a connection with a building that is not seen from the front but from the side, perhaps from a verandah.” This building data could thus have resulted from the steps mentioned above. If Seth is talking about a photo here, Jane and I do not know offhand what one it could be. We have photos of buildings in our album, of course, but no specific building or location comes to mind.</td><td>(“也和一栋建筑物有关联，不是从前面，而是从侧面，可能是从阳台看到它。”这个建筑资料可能出自上述台阶资料。如果赛斯在这里谈论的是一张照片，那么珍和我当下并不知道它可能是什么。当然，我们的相簿里有建筑物的照片，但想不到任何特定的建筑物或地点。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Something overturned.” The irregular shape of the pigment on the object; a similarity here between it and some liquid spilled.</td><td>(“某个被翻倒的东西。”物件上颜料的不规则形状；这里它和某种翻倒的液体之间有相似之处</td></tr><tr><td>(“The feeling of a fluid dark color, broken by white shapes that appear like blocks.” The wet pigment used to make the object was a fluid dark color, of course. Seth now uses the block data to refer to the whites scattered through the object on the original. Some of the whites are of a block shape, roughly, but more often simply irregular just as the pigment is.</td><td>(“感觉是一种在流动的深色，被看似块状的白色形状打破。”当然，用于制作物件的湿颜料是流动深色。赛斯现在用块状物资料来指遍布在原版上的白点。有些白点大致呈块状，但更多时候是像颜料一样不规则。</td></tr><tr><td>("Perhaps some connection with a pond or pool shape. "Again, this applies to the irregular shape of the pigment on the object, and is close, and in the same vein as the “something overturned, "and “the feeling of a fluid dark color" data. We regard these three impressions as good.</td><td>(“也许和一口池塘或池塘形状有些关联。”同样这适用于物件上颜料的不规则形状，而且和“某个被翻倒的东西”以及“感觉是一种在流动的深色”一样接近，方式也相同。我们认为这三个印象都是有效的。</td></tr><tr><td>( I neglected to deal with Seth's next impression, “The object marked in the middle of the back, in pen or pencil."</td><td>(我忘了处理赛斯的下一个印象，“物件的中间有笔或铅笔写的标记。”</td></tr><tr><td>(“Perhaps J B and a date. "Jane, or Seth, getting at the idea of photograph again. As stated earlier, I made two similar objects with the same pigment on May 10,1966. I dated and initialed the one not used in the envelope experiment; this gives an RB and a date, but I doubt if this is what Seth is getting at here.</td><td>(“也许是J B和日期。”珍或赛斯再次接收到照片的想法。前面说过，我在1966年5月10日用同一个颜料制作了两个相似的物件。我在没有用作信封实验物件的那一个上面写上日期和姓名缩写；这就有了一个RB和一个日期，但我怀疑赛斯这里接收到是不是这个。</td></tr><tr><td>(“ I do not get the feeling that the object has to do with the immediate present, in that it was not a part of your experience, directly. "Just the opposite. The object was part of my experience, in the immediate past. Jane had never seen the object or any like it, since I had never made any before; perhaps this data came out because she herself was thus not involved with the object in any way.</td><td>(“我没有感觉到物件和立即的当下有关，因为它不是你直接的经验之一。”恰恰相反。这个物件是我经验的一部分，在刚刚发生的过去。珍从来没见过这个物件或类似的东西，因为我之前从来没做过这种东西，或许这个资料之所以出现，是因为她自己由于这个缘故而没有以任何方式和物件产生任何关联。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed at 10:45.)</td><td>(珍在10:45继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will now end our session.

She decided to go ahead, however. I felt somewhat tired also. It was a warm and rainy night, which didn’t make us feel any more active.

A few of these will be indicated. )</td><td>(珍在这一节开始之前特别迟钝，还说她不太想要上课。无论如何，她决定照计划举行。我也觉得有点累。这是一个温暖的雨夜，却没有让我们感觉更活跃。(珍坐下来开始说话，闭着眼睛。她的速度缓慢，停顿很多次，其中一些时间很长。有几处停顿将会标示。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, we will have a short session.</td><td>现在，我们将会有一节短课。</td></tr><tr><td>There are a few points however that I wanted to make this evening. First of all, any effective large-scale space travel will be mental travel.</td><td>不过，我今晚想要讲几个重点。首先，任何有效的大规模太空旅行都是心智之旅。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth first mentioned this in the early sessions, shortly after January 1964.)</td><td>(在1964年1月之后不久，赛斯在早期课首次提到这一点。)</td></tr><tr><td>I use the term space travel loosely. In some conditions such expeditions will be powered by pooled mental or psychic resources. You may journey within your own solar system using physical vehicles, but you will not make any effective breakthrough beyond your solar system unless psychic and mental resources are developed.</td><td>我是以宽松的方式使用太空旅行一词。在某些情况下，这种探险是由汇集的心智或心灵资源提供动力。你们可以使用物质载具在你们自己的太阳系之内旅行，但除非开发出心智和心灵资源，否则你们在太阳系之外不会达成任何有效地突破。</td></tr><tr><td>Of course mental or psychic journeys into other dimensions and systems are possible, and when I speak of dimensions here I am not referring to space systems. Mentally you can cut through space, physically you cannot. In some of your dream states you do travel through other dimensions and other systems. The extent of these dream travels is determined by your own ability.</td><td>当然，进行其他维度和系统的心智或心灵之旅是可能的，当我谈到维度时，我指的不是空间系统。心智上，你可以穿越空间，但肉体上，你不能。在你的一些梦状态中，你的确行经其他维度和其他系统。这些梦中旅行的范围取决于你自己的能力。</td></tr><tr><td>Some of you are rather rigidly held within your own system even in your dreams, and though you exist within other dimensions such individuals are not aware of them. (Long pause.)</td><td>即使在你们的梦中，你们当中的一些人仍然相当固守在你们自己的系统之内，虽然你们存在其他维度之内，但是这样的个体对它们却毫无觉知。(长时间停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Mankind did at one time have what you may call a heavier body than at present. (Long pause, over one minute.) This particular body type has not vanished entirely by any means. The mental body, sometimes called the astral body, is the next one that you will inhabit. You inhabit it now, of course. (Long pause.)</td><td>现在。人类的确曾经有过你可以说比现在更重的身体。(长时间停顿，超过一分钟)无论如何，这一种体型并没有消失。心智体，有时被称为灵体，是你将要居住的下一个身体。当然，你现在就住在其中。(长时间的停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>Training and disciplined experimentation in the manipulation of this body will be of great benefit, for you will be facing some of the conditions that you will have to face when the physical body is discarded. (Long pause.)</td><td>透过训练和有纪律的实验，学习操纵这个身体，将会有莫大的好处，因为在肉体被抛下时你将会面临你必须面对的一些状况。</td></tr><tr><td>You will be gaining considerable experience of a vital kind. (Long pause.) You will learn to maintain stability and identity in the midst of a bewildering number of strange and previously unknown situations. With time you and Ruburt would do well indeed to set up experiments in which you try to contact each other while you are in the dream state. (Long pause.)</td><td>你将会获得相当可观的重要经验。(长时间停顿)奇怪而且前所未知的情况多到令人眼花缭乱，你将学会在其中维持稳定和本体。假以时日，你和鲁柏确实会成功创造出实验，在实验里你们会在梦状态中尝试互相联系。(长时间停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps I shall contact you both some night under those circumstances. Once more, remember in your dream experiments that you will be able to perceive not only your own constructions, but upon some occasions the constructions of others.</td><td>也许某个晚上我会在某些情况下与你们两人联系。再一次，记住在你的梦实验中，你不仅能够感知自己的建构，还可以在某些场合感知其他人的建构。</td></tr><tr><td>As you progress the sense of identity will be strengthened to meet, you see, the new challenges. As I mentioned earlier, in your cases the personality has set up certain safeguards so you will be in no danger. When such safeguards are not erected however, there is some danger. (Long pause.)</td><td>随着你的进步，本体感将会增强，以便迎接，你知道，新的新挑战。我之前提过，在你的情况下，人格已经建立一定的防护措施，所以你不会有任何危险。但是，如果这样的保护措施没有建立，那就会存在一些危险。(长时间的停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt’s own experience, in maintaining his own identity independently, while also allowing me to speak through him, will be to his benefit. It is, you see, quite possible for an individual in his dream travels to visit other planetary systems, of the past, present or future. Such visits are usually spontaneous and fragmentary.</td><td>在独立地维持自己的本体，同时也允许我透过他说话这方面，鲁柏自己的经验对他有利。你看，一个人在他的梦中旅行里，很可能会探访过去、现在或未来的其他行星系统。这样的探访通常是自发又零碎的。</td></tr><tr><td>It is best that they remain so. Take advantage of them when they happen within the dream state, but at this time do not attempt any such endeavor from the trance state. There are too many difficulties involved.</td><td>它们最好一直是如此。当它们在梦状态中发生时，要利用它们，但这时不要试图在出神状态做任何这类的努力。其中的困难太多了。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I suggest your break.</td><td>现在，我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26. Jane was “out" as usual. Her pace had remained very slow. Many of the pauses during the delivery lasted for over a minute. Her eyes began to open finally, and she smoked a cigarette and sipped iced tea. She said she thought the session would be short.</td><td>(9:26休息。珍像往常一样“出去”。她的速度一直很慢。在传述过程中，很多停顿持续了一分多钟。她的眼睛终于开始睁开，而且她抽了一支烟，喝了一口冰茶。她说她以为这一节会很短。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane now began to give the Instream material for the 64th experiment after break. As usual she sat with a hand to her closed eyes. Her pace actually speeded up a bit comparatively. Resume at 9:34.)</td><td>(休息之后，珍现在开始传述第64次实验的殷斯翠姆资料。像往常一样，她坐着，一只手放在闭着的眼睛上。相较之下，她的速度其实加快了一点。9:34继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>We are going to have a brief session.</td><td>我们这一节会很短。</td></tr><tr><td>I will give you our Instream material now.

Incidentally we are having a short session to give Ruburt a rest, and also to give you a rest, Joseph.</td><td>我现在要把我们的殷斯翠姆资料给你。请给我们一点时间。顺便说一下，我们这一节之所以很短，是为了让鲁柏休息，也为了让你休息，约瑟。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, for our object. One or two small white objects, perhaps dice. If not there is a close resemblance in size, shape and color. The numbers 7 and 3, perhaps facing upward.

Also four pieces of paper.</td><td>现在，说说我们的物件。一两个小型白色物件，也许是骰[tóu]子。如果不是，则在尺寸、形状和颜色上有相似之处。数字7和3，可能面朝上。这些物件可能和一个小链子连在一起，像袖扣那样。一个Q。我不知道这是指什么。还有4张纸。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, general impressions. A soreness in the throat, or a discomfort there on the part of Dr. Instream. A meeting with a stranger, a man, in his office, and some connection with Detroit. A group of four guests in particular, men I believe, to his apartment. This is separate from the earlier mention of the stranger. The initials’s P A in connection with the group.</td><td>现在，一般的印象。殷斯翠姆博士的喉咙疼痛或不适。在他的办公室，与一个陌生人，一个男人开会，而且和底特律有一些关联。尤其是一群4个客人，我相信是男人，到他的公寓。这和前面提到的陌生人是分开的。首字母SPA与这群人有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, do you have an envelope for me?</td><td>现在，你有没有信封要给我？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes.”</td><td>(“有。”</td></tr><tr><td>(At 9:23 Jane took the envelope for our 55th experiment from me without opening her eyes. She pressed it to her forehead briefly, then lowered it to her lap but kept the other hand to her eyes.)</td><td>(9:23，珍在没有睁开眼睛的情况下从我手上拿了第55次实验的信封。她把它按压在她的额头上一会儿，然后再把它放到大腿上，但另一只手一直放在眼睛上。)</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment, please.

She wasn’t aware of the traffic noise for instance, even though the windows were open. Her eyes remained closed through both experiments.</td><td>(9:58休息。她说，她完全出离。比如，虽然窗户是敞开的，但她对交通噪音毫无知觉。在两次实验中，她的眼睛全程一直闭着。</td></tr><tr><td>(See the tracing of the envelope object on page 171. I found it in a drawer of my desk about an hour before the session and decided to use it for the object on the spur of the moment. I opened up the match folder and removed the matches, then sealed it in the usual double envelope. I knew Jane hadn't seen it for at least a couple of years, and after the session she confirmed that it had been longer than that.</td><td>(见前面的信封物件描摹图。在这一节开始前一个小时左右，我在我的书桌抽屉里找到它，不假思索就决定用它当物件。我打开纸板火柴盒，拿走火柴棒，然后把它密封在一般的双层信封里。我知道珍至少有一两年没看过它了，在课结束后，她证实不止一两年没见过它。</td></tr><tr><td>( I picked up the matchbook in a restaurant, Mother Goldsmith’s in Saratoga Springs, NY. Jane has been familiar with the place since childhood, and on our infrequent visits to Saratoga we always stop in. I dated this particular matchbook on the inside when obtaining it—August 1963, which was before these sessions began in December 1963. The book is printed in black on a dim yellow—as Seth calls it—cardboard stock. All the copy on it, except for Nate Goldsmith's name beneath the caricature of him, is in this dim yellow against the black background.</td><td>(在纽约州撒拉托加温泉市的一家餐馆，“葛史密斯妈妈之家”[Mother Goldsmith's]，我拿了这个纸板火柴盒。珍从小就熟悉这个地方，而且我们虽然不常到撒拉托加，但都会顺路去那家餐馆一下。拿到这一个火柴盒那天，我在内层写上日期——1963年8月，就在1963年12月这些课开始之前。火柴盒是用黑色印刷在一种暗淡的黄色——就像赛斯说的那样——纸板材料上。除了在涅特·葛史密斯[Nate Goldsmith]他的漫画肖像之下的名字以外，所有的副本都是在黑色背景衬托下的这种暗淡的黄色。</td></tr><tr><td>(It wasn’t until Jane and I began to study the envelope data that we realized it referred to more than one visit to Saratoga on our part. This immediately complicated things. Interpretations became elusive indeed, and part of our knowledge that two visits to Saratoga were involved was subjective only. Had we realized this by the end of the session we would have called Seth back to help out. As it was we didn't appreciate what had happened until the time came to write these notes. Another complication is that while we cannot pin down all the data, we feel that most of it is quite legitimate.</td><td>(直到珍和我开始研究信封上的资料，我们才发觉它是指我们不止去过一次撒手托加。这立刻让事情变得复杂起来。解读的确变得难以捉摸，而且我们对于两次撒拉托加之行的认知有一部分只是主观的认知。如果我们在这一节结束时发觉这一点，就会召唤赛斯回来帮忙。因为在写这些注释之前，我们不知道发生了什么。另一个复杂之处是，虽然我们无法确定所有的资料，但我们感觉大多数都是合理的。</td></tr><tr><td>( I will indicate below where we believe the two Saratoga visits are referred to in the envelope data. The first visit was in August 1963, the second was in the summer of1964. On both occasions Jane and I were on our way to York Beach, Maine, on vacation; both visits to York Beach played a part in these sessions, and exact dates can be found in appropriate sessions. See Session 9 in Volume 1.</td><td>(我将会在正文标明我们以为信封资料指的是两次撒拉托加之行的地方。第一次是在1963年8月，第二次是在1964年夏天。在这两次探访中，珍和我都是在前往缅因州约克海滩度假的路上；两次约克海滩之行在这些课当中扮演了某种角色，确切的日期可以在适当的那几节里找到。见第一册第9节。</td></tr><tr><td>(The connection between the envelope object and our two visits to Mother Goldsmith’s is strong enough, in that Jane and I ate there both years. We saw the same hostess both times also—a girl Jane went to school with in Saratoga. We did not see Nate Goldsmith or his wife on the first visit, and the reasons we did not see either of them on our second visit are given in our data interpretations.</td><td>(信封物件和我们两次走访“葛史密斯妈妈之家”有着很大的关联，因为珍和我两年都去那里用餐。而且我们两次都见到了同样的老板娘——曾在撒拉托加和珍一起上学的女孩。第一次去的时候，我们没有看到涅特·葛史密斯或他的妻子，而在第二次去的时候，我们之所以没有看到他们两位的原因，在我们解读资料时会说明。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with a spade.” On our second visit, in 1964, Jane and I were told that Nate Goldsmith had died. We do not know just when he died, but believe it was after our first visit. Jane did not know the Goldsmiths intimately, merely to speak to. Also on the 1964 visit we were told the restaurant had been, or was being, sold.</td><td>(“和一张黑桃有关联。”在1964年我们第二次走访时，珍和我被告知涅特·葛史密斯已经过世。我们不知道他何时过世，但相信是在我们第一次走访之后。珍和葛史密斯夫妇并不熟，只是谈过话而已。同样在1964年那一次去的时候，我们被告知餐馆已经被卖掉或正在出售中。</td></tr><tr><td>(The spade impression here is apparently elaborated upon by Seth an impression or two later, in connection with underground data. There can be a connection with the black color of the suit of spades in a deck of playing cards, and the black of the object.</td><td>(这里的黑桃印象看样子会在一两个印象之后由赛斯详加说明，它和地底下资料有关。一副扑克牌当中黑桃花色的黑色与物件的黑色可能有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Four. Connection with a meeting.” This too took place on the 1964 visit. Jane feels subjectively sure that here the meeting between us and her father, Del, and his third wife, is referred to. The meeting was arranged by mail beforehand. Jane and I planned to meet Del and his wife, who were already camping at Saratoga Lake, there, and spend a few days with them before going on to Maine. This we did.</td><td>(“4。和一次会面有关联。”这也是在1964年走访中发生的。珍在主观上确信这里是指我们和她的父亲德尔以及他的第三任妻子之间的会面。这次会面是透过写信事先安排好的。珍和我打算去见德尔和他的妻子，和他们一起度过几天，再去缅因州，当时他们已经去那里的撒拉托加湖边露营了。我们就这样做了。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The impression here of something underground. I do not know whether to interpret this as a burial or not.” Possibly the death of Nate Goldsmith; we learned about this on our second visit. Jane, or Seth, has used the underground idea several times now in connection with death.</td><td>(“这里的印象是某个在地底下的东西。我不知道是不是要解释为埋葬。”可能是涅特·葛史密斯的死亡；我们在第二次走访时得知这件事。珍，或赛斯，至今用了几次地底下这个与死亡有关的概念。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Writing. Five, perhaps five lines.” Once again, we do not know just what Seth means by writing—type like this, printing, handwritten script or lettering, etc. The front cover of the object contains five lines of large type against the black background. The object was presented flat or opened up in the envelope, so also visible at a glance would be more than five lines—eight to be exact exclusive of the name on the caricature. I hand lettered inside the cover also. The phone number on the to fold of the object contains a five, but we don't know whether this means anything.</td><td>(“写作。5，也许是5行。”再一次，我们不知道赛斯说写作是什么意思——像这样印刷，书写或刻字等等的字体。物件的盒盖包含黑色背景衬托下的5行大型字体。物件在信封内呈现扁平或张开的样子，因此也一目了然，可以看到超过5行——确切地说是8行，除了漫画上的名字以外。我也在盒盖里面亲手写了字。物件顶端折叠处有一个电话号码，有5个数字，但我们不知道这是否意味着什么。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A card.” The object is manufactured of the usual cardboard stock used for matchbooks.

It is personal and so is not given in detail here, but can be explained by us at any time.</td><td>(“一个错误隐含的意义。”这是一个很好的关联，和我们两次去撒拉托加有关。它是私人的连结，所以不在这里详细说明，但我们随时可以解释。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A large round circular shape, perhaps inside of a rectangular one”, can refer to the caricature of Nate Goldsmith on the back of the object. The drawing is made up of rounded lines and shapes, is rounded in overall shape, and fits into the black rectangular flame. We don't particularly know why Seth uses large here, unless he means that the drawing could not be much larger and still fit into the rectangular shape.</td><td>(“一个大圆形，也许是在一个长方形里面。”可能是指物件背面的涅特·葛史密斯漫画肖像。这幅画是用圆形的线条和形状组成的，整体形状为圆形，并放进长方形的黑框里。我们不太知道为什么赛斯在这里用大这个字，除非他的意思是说这幅画不可能比长方形大太多，而且还放得进去。</td></tr><tr><td>(“and crisscross lines in the shape of a cross. ’’Jane said this data goes with the earlier underground and spade data, and is a symbolic reference to the death of Nate Goldsmith. Seth has used the cross idea before in indicating things ended, etc.</td><td>(“以及十字形的十字交叉线条。”珍说这个资料与稍早的地底下和黑桃资料一致，象征涅特·葛史密斯的死亡。赛斯曾经用十字形这个概念表示事情的结束等等。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The impression of movement, and some impression of a machine, perhaps an airplane. ’’Jane said this refers to our automobile trips to Saratoga, the object being obtained on the first of these in 1963.</td><td>(“移动的印象，以及一架机器的印象，也许是飞机。”珍说这是指我们去撒拉托加的自驾游，物件是在1963年第一次去的时候拿到的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Give us a moment. Red and green. A black or dark color against a light background. Also a dim yellow.” My first question concerned colors on the object. We don't know what the red and green refers to, since these are not present on the object. The object is however printed in black, against a light background. Seth’s description of a dim yellow is a most apt description of the color of the cardboard stock used for the object.</td><td>(“请给我们一点时间。红色或绿色。在浅色背景下的黑色或深色。也许是一种淡黄。”我的第一个问题是关于物体的颜色。我们不知道红色和绿色指的是什么，因为这些没有在物体上呈现。但是，该物件是以黑色打印的，背景是浅色的。赛斯对暗黄色的描述最贴切地描述了用于物件的纸板架的颜色。</td></tr><tr><td>(Possibly the yellow data also grew out of the gold in Nate Goldsmith’s name, which appears on the back of the object, as well as Mother Goldsmith’s name appearing on the front.</td><td>(“给我们一点时间。红色或绿色。浅色背景衬托下的黑色或深色。还有一种暗淡的黄色。”我的第一个问题涉及物件上的颜色。我们不知道红色和绿色指的是什么，因为物件上没有这两个颜色。然而，物件是用黑色印刷的，以浅色为背景。赛斯说暗淡的黄色，对于用来制造物件的纸板材料来说，是最恰当地描述。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Two men and two women.” I asked Seth to elaborate on the four people standing up data. Two men and two women were involved in the meeting referred to earlier: Jane's father Del and myself and Jane and Del’s wife.

The object was a pencil drawing I made of Jane this afternoon, without her knowledge. I looked down on her as she sunned herself my viewpoint being the back row of the studio windows on the second story. The sketch took but a few minutes because she moved so frequently, and I was much amused at her restlessness; this mirth plays a part in the experimental results. The drawing is on porous paper with a slight yellowish cast. I placed it between the usual two pieces of Bristol, then sealed it in double envelopes.</td><td>(第56次信封实验在课间举行。物件是今天下午我为珍画的一幅铅笔素描，她并不知道。在她晒太阳时，我从二楼工作室后排窗户的角度俯瞰她。速写只花了几分钟，因为她频繁地移动，静不下来的样子把我逗得很乐；这种欢乐在实验结果当中起了作用。素描画在多孔活页纸上，带点些微的黄色色调。我把它放在两片普通的纸板之间，然后密封在双层信封里。</td></tr><tr><td>(Before the session Jane said she had no idea of what Seth would talk about. She began speaking while sitting down and with her eyes closed. She had left a cigarette burning however, and her eyes soon began to open. Her voice was quiet, her pace quite slow.)</td><td>(在这一节开始之前，珍说她完全不知道赛斯会说些什么。她一边坐下来一边闭着眼睛开始说话。不过，她却留下一支点着的烟，她的眼睛不久就开始张开。她的声音安静，速度缓慢。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth."</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”</td></tr><tr><td>(One minute pause.) There are several points I would like to make. For all practical purposes, you will find yourself in some sort of body form in your out-of-body experiences.</td><td>(停顿1分钟)有几个重点我想说一下。为了所有实际的目的，你会在出体经验中发现你自己处于某种身体形式。</td></tr><tr><td>These body forms however are necessary camouflages, for you cannot yet think of identity without some kind of physical body. Therefore you project yourself in a body form. It varies according to your own abilities, and without it you would feel lost indeed. The form itself is not important, but the form can tell you something about the dimension in which you are having experience.</td><td>然而，这些身体形式是必要的伪装，因为你还无法想像没有某种肉体的本体。因此，你以身体形式投射自己。它根据你自己的能力而有所不同，没有它你真的会感到迷茫。形式本身并不重要，但形式可以让你对你正在获得经验的维度有所了解。</td></tr><tr><td>The dream body is the one with which you are most familiar. It has been called the astral body. It strikes you as being physical, though you can do things with it that you cannot do with your physical body. You can levitate with it, for example. As a rule you do not go through walls with this body. This is the body that you use for ordinary dreams. Levitation is possible with it, but on a very limited basis.</td><td>梦体是你最熟悉的身体。它被称为灵体。虽然你以为它是有形的，但你却可以用它来做你用肉体做不到的事。比方说，你可以用它来漂浮。通常，你用这个身体是无法穿墙而过的。这是你用于平常梦的身体。用它来漂浮是可能的，但是范围非常有限。</td></tr><tr><td>When you enter a different dimension the abilities of the body form change, and for all intents and purposes it is a different body form, which we will call a mind form. It still seems physical in shape, but you can walk through physical matter with it, and you can truly levitate with it within your solar system, but you cannot go beyond in this mind form.</td><td>当你进入一个不同的维度时，身体形式的能力就会改变，而且为了所有的意图和目的，它是一种不同的身体形式，我们称之为心智形式(mind form)，它的形状看起来似乎是有形的，但你可以用它来穿过物质实体，你真的可以在你们的太阳系之内用它来漂浮，但你用这种心智形式无法超越太阳系。</td></tr><tr><td>You can travel anywhere within your solar system however with it. In the first form it is possible to perceive the past, present and future on a limited basis. In the second form this perception is on a larger scale, the scope of consciousness being further opened. Now this is the form that you will use if you meet appointments with others within the dream state.</td><td>但是，你可以用它在你们的太阳系之内任何地方旅行。在第一种形式中，感知过去、现在和未来是可能的，但范围有限。在第二种形式中，这种感知的规模更大，意识的范围更进一步扩大。现在，如果你在梦状态之内与其他人相约见面，这就是你会使用的形式。</td></tr><tr><td>The third form we may call the true projection form. In it, it is possible to travel beyond your solar system, and to perceive the past, present and future of other systems as well as your own.</td><td>第三种形式，我们可以称之为真正的投射形式。在其中，要去太阳系以外的地方旅行，要探索其他以及你们自己系统的过去、现在和未来，都是可能的。</td></tr><tr><td>The form that you use does not dictate the various abilities. You don the particular form in line with your abilities. You do the best you can, in other words. (Smile.) It is possible to begin an experience in one form, and change to another, or to go from the first to the third. On such occasions you must therefore, you see, pass through in reverse direction. The forms do merely represent various stages of consciousness.</td><td>你使用的形式并没有规定要有各种能力。你根据自己的能力，选择特定的形式。换句话说，你可以尽力而为。(微笑)先以一种形式开始一个经验，然后换到另一种形式，或从第一种换到第三种。因此，在这样的情况下，你知道，你必须反向经历。形式只不过是代表意识的各种不同阶段而已。</td></tr><tr><td>At physical death, after the last reincarnation, then the normal body form is the dream body, and excursions are made from this point, you see. It is possible to suddenly switch from the third form to the dream body, but at a considerable jolt to the consciousness, as a rule. Transition is simply too sudden.</td><td>肉体死亡之时，在最后一次转世以后，平常的身体形式就是梦体，然后，你看，就从这一点开始游历。突然从第三种形式切换到梦体是有可能的，但通常会对意识造成相当大的震撼。转变太过突然了。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I realize that Ruburt is not too happy with me for bringing up this next point. Intellectually he is highly critical of it. On another level however he knows very well that it is legitimate. There are indeed others who can help you in such experiences, and who often do while you are in the dream state, whether or not you know it. They can be of great assistance as guides.</td><td>现在我发觉鲁柏对我接下来要提这一点不太高兴。在理智上，他对此严加批判。但在另一个层面上，他非常清楚这是合理的。在这样的经验中，的确有其他人可能帮助你，而且在你处于梦状态时，他们经常这么做，无论你知不知道。作为向导，他们可以提供很大的协助。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your first break.</td><td>我建议你第一次休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:25.  Jane was out as usual. Her pace was a little better as the session progressed, although her eyes remained closed for most of it.</td><td>(9:25休息，珍像往常一样出去了。随着课的进行，她的速度稍微好一点，但是她的眼睛大部分时间都闭着。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane confirmed that she did not like the “spiritual guide" connotation. Seth's material upon resumption stems from the fact that Jane, housecleaning lately, had switched our bed from a north-south axis to east-west. Resume at 9:31, eyes open, smiling broadly.)</td><td>(珍确认她的确不喜欢“指导灵”的意涵，赛斯休息过后继续传过来的资料源于以下的事实：最近珍在大扫除时把我们的床从南北向转成东西向。9:31分继续，眼睛睁开，脸上挂着大大的笑容。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now my dear friends, you will find all projections much easier if your head is to the north.</td><td>现在，我亲爱的朋友们，如果你们的头朝着北边，你们会发现所有的投射都会容易多了。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt will not be happy with this. Projection is certainly possible in any case. However at your period of development it would be simpler to have everything working for you that you can. It is up to you to make decisions. Perhaps the other comforts that the room affords you with the bed in another position, is worth it to you for a while. T his in no way changes the fact that projections are more easily executed with the head to the north.</td><td>鲁柏对这一点会不高兴。无论如何，投射肯定是可能的。但是，在你们的发展阶段，尽可能拥有对你有用的一切，事情会比较简单。你们自己决定。也许因为把床换到另一个位置，房间可以提供给你们的其他舒适，是值得你们这样做一阵子的。但是头部朝北更容易进行投射这个事实绝对不会因此改变。</td></tr><tr><td>One small interesting point here. Ruburts projection upon first looking over the Fox book was quite legitimate.</td><td>这里有一个小而有趣的重点。鲁柏在第一次看过福克斯的书之后就投射，是相当合理的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Astral Projection, by Oliver Fox. After reading part of this book very recently, Jane achieved her first deliberate projection.)</td><td>(《灵体投射》，作者奥利弗·福克斯。最近刚看了这本书的一部分内容，珍就达成了她第一次刻意进行的投射。)</td></tr><tr><td>However the window (smile, eyes open) you see, was a quite valid fabrication of his own. The projection was a projection. The window through which he ascended was a symbol necessary to him. The actual physical window was behind his head, you see, so he felt impelled to have a window in front of him, in order to get out of the physical house.</td><td>然而，你看窗户(微笑，睁眼)，是他自己一个非常有效的虚构之物。投射就是投射。他登上的窗户对他来说是一个必要的象征。你看，实际的窗户在他的头后面，所以他觉得被迫要有一扇窗户在他的面前，才能离开实体房屋。</td></tr><tr><td>I found this amusing. The symbol was a highly valuable one however, obviously. You will both improve with practice. Because of your ideas, you see, you experience more difficulty in getting out of the physical house. (Smile.) Ruburts window image, had the experience continued, would have effectively done this for him. He did not have the confidence to imagine himself, you see, passing through the physical walls.</td><td>我觉得这很好笑。但是很明显，这个象征非常有价值。你们两人越练习就会越进步。你知道，因为你的意念，你在离开实体房屋时遇到更多困难。(微笑)如果这个经验持续下去的话，鲁柏的窗户意象本来可以为他有效地完成这件事。你看，他没有信心去想像自己穿过实体墙壁。</td></tr><tr><td>Instead he has to form the imaginary image of a window, which is in itself some feat, and then project himself through this. It is quite all right. I merely wanted to point out what he did. When you project from the dream body, you see, consciously you are already outside, as a rule. You have already made the initial change away from physical focus.</td><td>相反的，他必须形成一扇窗户的想像意象，这本身就是一个壮举，然后把他自己从中投射出去。不要紧。我只是想要指出他做了什么。当你从梦体投射时，你看，通常在意识上你已经在外面了。你已经做了最初的改变，从物质焦点转移开来。</td></tr><tr><td>The mass of valid projections are indeed made from the dreaming body. When the excursion is over the return to the dream body is made with no strain, you see, for the ego is little concerned. In most such instances however the knowledge is then not available to the waking self at all.</td><td>有效投射的质量确实是来自梦体。当游历结束时，回到梦体是不费力的，你看，因为自我几乎不参与。无论如何，在大多数这类情况下。这个知识对醒时的自己来说根本是不可得的。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Some of Fox’s suggestions are excellent. They will allow you to take the waking consciousness along with you. As your abilities develop and as you become more accustomed to the experience, the waking consciousness will recall more and more, and not become frightened.

The chemical reaction results in an electromagnetic connection between the consciousness and the physical body, and without it there would be no return to the physical body, in your terms.

This freedom of consciousness is not dependent upon physical existence, you see.</td><td>然而，在这类出体经验中，全部都使用了一种化学能量。化学反应导致意识和肉体之间产生电磁连结，没有它，用你们的话来说，就不会回到肉体。但是，当然，使化学能量成为可能的，是心智能量。你知道，这种意识的自由并不依赖物质存在。</td></tr><tr><td>During your present life however the connection must be maintained.

The plant is an old one, and one of our favorites. We see it every day of course but I was sure Jane wasn't aware of these two specific leaves separately. The plant also has an interesting history, which will be brought out later. I taped the leaves to one of the two pieces of Bristol used in these experiments, sandwiched it against the other piece, then sealed the two in the usual double envelopes. Note that the word "top” is penciled on the back of the Bristol; this was done by me after the experiment, but before Jane saw the objects, as will be shown later.</td><td>(第57次信封试验的标的物是从我们的圣诞红叶上面摘下的两片叶子。这棵植物种了很多年，也是我们最喜欢的植物之一。我们每天都看到它，但我确定珍没有分别注意到这两片特定的叶子。这棵植物也有一段有趣的历史，稍后将会说明。我用胶带把两片叶子沾在这些实验使用的两块纸板之一，像三明治一样夹住两块纸板，然后放进一般的双层信封里密封起来。注意，在这片纸板的背面有用铅笔写的“上面[top]”这个词；这是我在实验之后写上的，但是在珍看到物件之前，稍后会加以说明。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane had been housecleaning, and to air the place out all the windows were open, still, at session time. Thus Jane began speaking in a voice quite a bit stronger than usual, evidently to counter the constant street noise. Her eyes soon began to open; she began speaking with a smoking cigarette in her hand. Her pace was fair.)</td><td>(珍一直在打扫房子，而且为了这个地方的通风，所有窗户在上课时间仍然开着。因此，珍开始用比平时有力很多的声音说话，显然是为了对抗持续不断的街道噪音。她的眼睛很快就开始睁开；她开始说话时，手中拿着一支烟。她的速度不错。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth. ")</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>We will continue our previous discussion.</td><td>我们要继续先前的讨论。</td></tr><tr><td>I want to give you some idea of the conditions that you may expect to meet in any successful projections, so that you will be prepared to some extent. For simplicity’s sake we shall call the body forms of which we spoke in our last session, forms one, two and three.</td><td>我想让你了解一下你在任何成功的投射中可能预期会遇到的一些状况，以便你做好一定程度的准备。为了简单起见，我们要把在上一节谈过的身体形式称为形式一、形式二和形式三。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, form number one will spring out of an ordinary dream state. In spontaneous projections you may become conscious in form number one, legitimately project, return to the ordinary dream state, and project again several times. You can expect therefore that these projections will be difficult to interpret, though you may find the experience intact in the middle of the record of any given dream.</td><td>现在，形式一是从一个普通的梦状态中弹出来。在自发的投射中，你可能会在形式一变得有意识，合理地投射，回到普通的梦状态，并再度投射几次。因此，你可以预期，要解读这些投射并不容易，但是你可能会发现这个经验完整保存在任何一个梦的记录当中。</td></tr><tr><td>The excursions with form number one will be of your own system, and largely connected to the earth, although past, present and future may be involved. You may, for example, visit New York in the year 2,000. This is at least possible, you see, using form number one.</td><td>形式一之旅将是在你们自己的系统之内，尽管可能牵涉到过去、现在和未来，但大部分是和地球连结在一起。比方说，你可以造访2000年的纽约。你看，使用形式一，这至少是可能的。</td></tr><tr><td>The projections here are fairly short in duration, though exceptionally clear. You may encounter phantoms from your own subconscious however, and they will seem exceedingly real. If you realize that you are projecting you may simply order any unpleasant subconscious phantoms to disappear, and they will do so.</td><td>尽管异常清晰，但这里的投射持续时间相当短。不过，你可能会遇见来自你自己潜意识的幽灵，而且它们看起来真实至极。如果你发觉你正在投射，你只要命令任何令人不快的潜意识幽灵消失，它们就会消失了。</td></tr><tr><td>They will do so in the same way that a nightmare will disappear if you realize that it is a product of your own subconscious. If you treat it as a reality however, then you must deal with it as such, until you realize its origin, or return to the ordinary dream state.</td><td>如果你发觉它是你自己潜意识的产物，它们就会以噩梦消失的那种方式消失无踪。如果你把它当作实相，那么你就得这样应付它，直到你明白它的起因，或回到普通的梦状态为止。</td></tr><tr><td>(Long pause.) In form two, you will not as a rule encounter any subconscious phantoms, and usually you make the change to form two from the state in which form one is used. The ordinary dream elements will not be as frequent, nor will they intrude as much into the experience itself.</td><td>(长时间停顿)在形式二当中，你多半不会遇见任何潜意识的幽灵，而且通常你会从使用形式一的状态，变成形式二。普通的梦元素不会那么频繁出现，也不会侵入经验本身。</td></tr><tr><td>A longer duration of projection is possible. The vividness is extraordinary. You will begin here to perceive very clearly constructions that are not your own, where earlier these were but dimly glimpsed. A certain period of orientation will be necessary, simply because these other constructions may be bewildering. Some will exist in your future. Some may have existed in your past, and some were thought of but never physically materialized.</td><td>持续时间更久的投射是可能的。无比的生动逼真。这里你会开始非常清楚感知不属于你自己的建构，之前只是模糊瞥见这些建构而已。一定时间的定位是必要的，纯粹是因为这些其他的建构可能令人困惑。有些将会存在你的未来。有些可能已经存在你的过去，还有一些被认为永远不会在物质上具体显化。</td></tr><tr><td>But the reality of all of these constructions will be equally vivid, you see, for they are indeed equally real. I will give you one very simple example. Suppose you find yourself in a room with certain people, and you recognize later upon awakening that this room and these people both belong to a particular sequence in a novel. You think then, “This was no projection, simply a dream.”</td><td>但是，你看，这些建构的实相全部都一样生动，因为它们的确是一样真实。我要举一个非常简单的例子给你听。假设你发现自己和某些人在一个房间里，后来你醒过来，认出这个房间和这些人都属于一部小说里的一个特定段落。然后你想：“这根本不是投射，这只是一个梦。”</td></tr><tr><td>It may however be a valid projection. The room and the people exist, but they do not exist in the manner which you endorse as reality. They exist in another dimension, but as a rule you cannot perceive it. In this case, you see, since the book has already been written you could say that the scene was a past event, at least of the imagination, at the time the author conceived of it.</td><td>然而，它可能是一个有效的投射。房间和人都存在，但它们不是以你认可为实相的方式存在。它们存在另一个维度，但通常你无法感知它。在这个案例中，你看，由于这本书已经写完了，你可以说这个场景是一个过去的事件，至少是想像中的，在作者构思它的时候。</td></tr><tr><td>Obviously, physical reality only happens to be the portion of reality you recognize. The paintings that you will paint exist now. It is possible for you to project yourself into one of your own future landscapes. This would not be an imaginative projection. This is what I am trying to tell you.</td><td>显然，物质实相恰好只是你认得的那一部分实相而已。你将要画的图画现在就存在。你把自己投射到自己未来的景观之中是可能的。这不是一个想像的投射。我想告诉你的就是这个。</td></tr><tr><td>You had better take your break.</td><td>你最好休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:28. Jane was dissociated as usual. Her eyes had opened often, and she had smoked and sipped iced tea. Her pace had been average.</td><td>(9:28休息。珍像往常一样出离，她的眼睛经常睁开，她抽了烟，喝了冰茶。她的速度中等。</td></tr><tr><td>(A question had occurred to me as Seth spoke and I voiced it now: Were any of the results of our experimental data, involving either Dr. Instream or our own envelopes, the result of unsuspected projections on Jane's part? Seth refers to the question later in the session.</td><td>(我在赛斯说话时想到了一个问题，现在把它说出来：“我们的实验资料，和殷斯翠姆博士或我们自己的信封有关，有没有任何结果是珍那边出乎意料的投射造成的结果？”稍后赛斯在课间提到了这个问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same manner at 9:35.)</td><td>(9:35分，珍以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>You may find yourself in the midst of a battle that was once planned in some general’s mind, a battle that never materialized in physical reality.</td><td>你可能会发现自己置身在某个将军脑海中曾经计划过的一场战争，一场战斗从未在物质实相具体显化的战争。</td></tr><tr><td>In such a case incidentally, you were not a part of the battle, and you cannot be harmed. However you might be attracted enough to project yourself spontaneously into the body of one of the soldiers, in which case you could experience pain, until your own fear pulled you back. It will be a matter of learning control under such conditions. (Long pause, eyes opening often.)</td><td>顺便说一下，在这个案例中，你不是战争的一部分，你不可能受到伤害。但是，你可能会被吸引到足以把自己投射到其中一名士兵的身体中，在这种情况下，你可能会经历痛苦，直到你自己的恐惧把你拉回来为止。这是一个在这种状况下学习控制的问题。(长时间停顿，眼睛经常睁开。)</td></tr><tr><td>There are various situations which you must learn to handle, attractions and repulsions which could pull you willy-nilly in any direction. Experience is the only way for you to learn how to handle these.</td><td>有各种各样你必须学会处理的情况，不管你愿不愿意，吸引和排斥可能会把你拉到任何方向去。经验是你学习处理这些问题的唯一途经。</td></tr><tr><td>What is required is a steady maintenance of identity, under conditions which will be new as far as your conscious awareness is concerned. In the cases about which we have been speaking, I cannot emphasize too strongly that actual projection into other dimensions occurs. Many such instances are often considered mad dreams, because there is no way to check against physical events. The events never happened in physical terms.</td><td>所需的条件是，在种种就你的意识觉知而言前所未有的新状况中，稳定维持本体。在我们谈论的案例中，实际投射到其他维度是会发生的，这一点我再怎么强调都不为过。很多这样的实例通常被认为是疯狂的梦，因为没有办法依据物质事件来核对。就物质而言，事件从未发生过。</td></tr><tr><td>(Very restless, rubbing eyes heavily.) Now listen carefully for a moment. It is possible in form two to project to a future event (eyes now open wide and steady, very dark) in which you will be involved, and by an act that you make in the projection, alter the course that this future will take. (Smile.)</td><td>(非常不安，用力揉眼睛)现在仔细听一下。在形式二之内，投射到你会参与的未来事件，是可能的(眼睛现在张开而且稳定，颜色非常深)，而且透过你在投射中做出的行为，改变这个未来将会采取的路线，也是可能的。(微笑)。</td></tr><tr><td>Such an action would therefore appear to happen twice—once in your present, and once in your future, you see. But in the future (smile) you would be the one whose course is altered by this traveling self from the past.</td><td>因此，这样的行动看起来发生两次——一次在你的现在，一次在你的未来，你看。但是在未来(微笑)，你是被这个来自过去的自己改变方向的人。</td></tr><tr><td>(Eyes continually open. Delivery very emphatic, with many gestures.)</td><td>(眼睛持续睁开。传述中语多强调，比了很多手势。)</td></tr><tr><td>Let us take an example. You sleep. While asleep you project yourself into the year 1972. There you see yourself considering various courses of action. For a moment you are aware of a sense of duality as you look at this older self. You say you should do this or that, give a definite decision, you see. This may happen in several ways. We will go into this sort of thing more deeply in another session.</td><td>让我们来举个例子。你睡觉。在你睡着的时候，你把自己投射到1972年。在那里你看到自己正在考虑各种行动方案。有一刻，在你注视这个比较老的自己时，你觉察到一种二元之感。你说你应该做这个或那个，做出明确的决定，你知道。这可能以几种方式发生。我们将会在另一节更深入讨论这类事情。</td></tr><tr><td>(Eyes open.) In any case this future self of yours heeds what you say. Now, in the actual future you are the self who one way or another, you see, hears the voice of his past self. (Jane leans forward, knocking on the tabletop for emphasis, eyes wide.) Perhaps in a dream, or perhaps in a projection, made into the past.</td><td>(睁着眼睛)无论如何，你的这个未来的自己听从你说的话。现在，在实际的未来，你就是这个自己，他以某种方式，你看，听到他过去的自己发出的声音。(珍倾身向前，敲着桌面以示强调，双眼圆睁)也许在梦中，或也许在投射中，回到过去。</td></tr><tr><td>Before our break I will leave you with a few questions. (Smile, lighting cigarette.) Was there something your future self had forgotten? Did the future self request information, and did this request cause the present self, you see, to make an actual and legitimate projection into the future?</td><td>在我们休息之前，我会留下几个问题给你们。(微笑，点烟)你未来的自己有没有忘了什么？未来的自己有没有要了什么资讯，而且这个要求有没有造成现在的自己，你知道，做了一次实际又合理的投射而进入未来吗？</td></tr><tr><td>You may now take your break. I do intend to answer your question, incidentally, when we get to it.</td><td>你现在可以休息一下。顺便说一下，当我们开始谈到它的时候，我的确想要回答你的问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:57. Jane was well dissociated. Her pace had been average but her manner very emphatic. She had smiled often and used many gestures. Her eyes had been open for paragraphs at a time. She had been aware of nothing but the material, she said.</td><td>(9:57休息。珍完全出离。她的速度不急不徐，但是非常用力强调。她经常微笑，并且比了很多手势。她的眼睛睁开一次持续几个段落。她说除了资料以外，她对什么都没有知觉。</td></tr><tr><td>(It was now time for the 66th Dr. Instream experiment. Jane sat with a hand raised to her closed eyes. Resume at 10:04.)</td><td>(现在是进行第66次殷斯翠姆博士实验的时间。珍坐着，举起一只手，放在闭着的眼睛上。10:04分继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment, please, for our Instream material.</td><td>请给我们一点时间处理我们的殷斯翠姆资料。</td></tr><tr><td>A slide rule. I have the impression of a classroom, large with many windows on one side of the room... (Long pause.) Facing west, the windows facing west.</td><td>一把计算尺。我有一间教室的印象，很大，房间的一侧有许多窗户……(长时间停顿)面朝西边，窗户朝着西边。</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps two windows also on the south side; though I am not sure these are windows on the south side, but window shapes in any case. The others are windows. There is no building immediately outside of them, but grass and street or a courtyard.</td><td>也许在南面也有两个窗户；虽然我不确定这些是南侧的窗户，但无论如何就是窗户形状。其他的都是窗户。它们外面没有建筑物，而是草地或街道。</td></tr><tr><td>I believe that Dr. Instream was here just before twilight this evening. At one time with five particular people, talking to them. At an earlier time there were more people in the room, a small crowd. I believe that hypnosis was under discussion. The slide rule may have been used somehow in a demonstration.</td><td>我相信就今天傍晚黄昏之前，殷斯翠姆博士在这里。一度有5个特定的人，与他们交谈。在较早的时候，房间里有更多人，一小群人。我相信讨论的是催眠。可能在示范中以某种方式使用了计算尺。</td></tr><tr><td>Something on a desk. A small circle of glass on a flat base. Perhaps a paperweight, I do not know. The speaker handled it often. It is of palm size, that is, the palm easily fits over the glass circle portion.</td><td>某个在一张桌子上的东西。在一个平坦底座上的一小圈玻璃。也许是一个纸镇，我不知道。讲话的人经常把玩它。它是手掌大小，也就是手掌轻易可以盖住玻璃圆圈部分。</td></tr><tr><td>The object seems to be a bead, or something resembling a bead. Much smaller than the other object, and round. It may be of metal.</td><td>物件似乎是一颗珠子，或类似珠子的东西。比其他物体小很多，而且是圆的。它可能是金属做的。</td></tr><tr><td>Now do you have an envelope for me?</td><td>你有没有信封要给我？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes.”</td><td>(“有。”</td></tr><tr><td>(At 10:13 Jane took the envelope for our 57th experiment from me without opening her eyes. She held it to her forehead with its long axis horizontal', as she almost always does. This position is rather important to the results of the experiment, as will be shown. Jane remembers holding the envelope in this fashion, and I watched her do so.)</td><td>(10:13，珍从我这里拿了第57次实验信封而没有睁开眼睛。她把它放在额头上，长边呈水平方向，她几乎向来都是这样做。这个位置对于实验的结果非常重要，如下文所示。珍记得她以这种方式拿着信封，而我则看着她这样做。)</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment, please.</td><td>请给我们一点时间。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, I have the impression of something round—more oval, perhaps. Fairly large in the center of a square or rectangular object.</td><td>再一次，我有某个圆形东西的印象——也许更像椭圆形。在一个正方形或长方形物件的正中央，相当大。</td></tr><tr><td>Also something in the center of the oval. (Jane now lowered the envelope to her lap with her left hand, sitting however with her other hand still to her closed eyes.) Two horizontal lines, rather widely separated from each other.</td><td>还有在椭圆形正中央的某个东西。(珍现在用左手将信封放到她的大腿上，然而她坐着，另一只手依然放在她闭着的眼睛上。)两条水平线，彼此相隔甚远。</td></tr><tr><td>A small star like shape, perhaps in the lower right hand corner, holding the object this way. (Jane gestured with the envelope which she now held so that the short dimensions were horizontal to the floor. I noted this position and watched her closely to see if she changed the envelope's position as the experiment continued.)</td><td>一个小小的像星星的形状，也许在右下角，用这种方式握住物件。(珍用她现在握住的信封比了个手势，好让短的两边与地板保持水平。我记下这个位置并仔细观察她，看她在实验继续时，是否改变信封的位置。)</td></tr><tr><td>A connection with 1961.</td><td>和1961年有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Yellow and red. A tall tree, exceptionally tall, I believe. Ruburt here thinks of his mother Marie. We will simply mention it. A connection with the month of February. An initiation. Something on the back or inside of the object. Did the object once open up?</td><td>黄色和红色。一棵高大的树，我相信，特别高。鲁柏在这里想到她的母亲玛丽(Marie)。我们会简单提一下。</td></tr><tr><td>The impression of continued writing. A connection with a note, I believe, or a card that opened, with writing or copy on an inside page. Orange. The orange seems to be connected with black also. Or dark color. Perhaps like dark lettering.</td><td>和2月份有关联。一个开始。某个在物件背面或里面的东西。这个物件曾经开启过吗？继续书写的印象。我相信和一张纸条，或打开的卡片有关联，在内页上有写的或复印的字。橙色。橙色似乎也和黑色有关联。或是深色。也许像深色的美术字。</td></tr><tr><td>The impression of a water connection. With something beginning with an M, and something beginning with a G, and with four objects.</td><td>和水有关联的一个印象。和某个M开头的东西，以及某个G开头的东西有关联，也和4个物件有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have any questions?</td><td>你有没有任何问题？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Can you say something more about those two horizontal lines?”)</td><td>(“你能不能多说一些这两条水平线的事？)</td></tr><tr><td>I have the impression of two dark horizontal lines, one rather toward the top and one rather toward the bottom. (Jane again gestured with the envelope. She held it in the same position as noted before, the small dimensions parallel to the floor. She hadn’t changed its position by idly turning it, for example.) Both inside, but just an oval shape. Holding the object this way. (The same gesture again.) Now I suggest your break. Unless you have any more questions.</td><td>我有两条深色水平线的印象，一条比较朝着上方，另一条比较朝着下方。(珍再次用信封比了手势。她握住它的位置和前面提到的一样，短的两边与地板平行。例如，她只是随便转动它一下，并没有改变它的位置。)两条都在里面，但只是一个椭圆形状。以这种方式握住物件。(又是同样的手势)现在我建议你休息一下。除非你还有更多疑问。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Well then, try naming the object.')</td><td>(“那就，试试指出物件名称。”)</td></tr><tr><td>(Pause.) I have the impression, holding the object this way, (again the same gesture) of a rectangular object, a card that is connected with a picture, and strongly connected with something that opened, as a letter could open to another page.</td><td>(停顿)我有一个印象，这样握住物件，(又是同样的手势)是一个长方形物件，一张卡片，和一幅图片有关联，也和某个打开的东西有很大的关联，就像可以打开另一页的一封信。</td></tr><tr><td>Also a dim connection with the word master. Master list, I do not know. I suggest your break.</td><td>还有一个和“主要的”(master)这个词隐约有关的连结。主要的清单(master list)，我不知道。我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:25. Jane said she was really “out.” Way-out, she said, not aware of anything but the data and the connection to or with her mother, Marie. Her eyes had remained closed through both experiments, her pace had been good.</td><td>(10:25休息。珍说她真的“出去了。”她说，出去很远，除了这个资料以及和她母亲玛丽的关联之外，她什么都没有知觉。她的双眼在两个实验里始终闭着，她的速度很好。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane always sits quietly for a few moments after leaving trance until she is fully oriented. This gave me enough time to once again see that she held the envelope in the same position relative to the floor. I called her attention to this, then marked the outer envelope “top”. Next I marked the inside envelope the same way, then the two pieces of Bristol the same way as Jane watched. The two leaves were sandwiched between the Bristol’s. Note the top marking in pencil on the back of the object, as indicated on the tracing on page 189.</td><td>(离开出神状态之后，珍总是会安静地坐一会儿，直到她完全适应为止。这让我有足够的时间再次看到她让信封维持在相对于地板的相同位置上。我叫她注意这个，然后在外层信封标注“上方”[top]。接下来，珍看着我用同样的方式标记了内层信封，然后以同样方式标记在两片纸板上。两片叶子夹在纸板之间。注意上方标记是用铅笔写在物件背面，如前的描摹图所示。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane had one image which will be mentioned in place. We were able to make quite a few connections, and Seth helped us with one after break. The session was over now however for most practical purposes. Since the object did not originate with us, we were not able to make some connections which we supposed were probably valid. The history of the poinsettia plant which furnished the leaves used as objects will unfold to some extent as we interpret the data. (“Again, I have the impression of something round—more oval, perhaps. Fairly large in the center of a square or rectangular object. "As noted Jane held the envelope to her forehead with the long axis parallel to the floor. No matter which long edge was uppermost this places the large poinsettia leaf in the center of the card as far as the short edges are concerned. Even so the large leaf would be off center, either above or below, as far as the long edges are concerned. I hoped Seth would mention two objects, but he did not.</td><td>(珍有一个意象，在恰当的地方会提到。我们能够找到好几个关联，而且赛斯在休息后也帮我们找到一个。但是就最实际的目的而言，这一节已经结束。因为物件不是来自我们，所以我们无法找到一些我们认为可能有效的关联。在我们解读资料时，关于提供叶子作为物件的这棵圣诞红，它的历史也会随之揭露。(“再一次，我有某个圆形东西的印象——也许更像椭圆形。在一个正方形或长方形物件的正中央，相当大。”如上所述，珍把信封放在她的额头上，长轴与地板平行。无论哪个长边在最上面，就短边而言，这都会让大的圣诞红叶子位于卡片正中央。即便如此，就长边而言，大叶子也会偏离中心，不在上面就是在下面。我希望赛斯提到两个物件，但他没有。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth goes from round to oval, which is more specific as far as the leaf is concerned, and from square to rectangular, which is more specific as far as the rectangular shape of the piece of Bristol to which I had taped both objects is concerned. The bigger of the two leaves is fairly large as far as the overall size of the piece of Bristol is concerned.</td><td>(赛斯从圆形变成椭圆形，就叶片而言更具体，而从正方形变成长方形，就我把两个物件沾在其上的那片长方形纸板而言也更具体。就这片纸板的整体面积而言，两片叶子当中比较大的一片是相当大的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Also something in the center of the oval.” Evidently Seth here picks up the fishbone pattern formed by veins and stems in one or both of the objects, as the next data develops.</td><td>(“还有，在椭圆形正中央的某个东西。”显然，随着下一个资料的发展，这里赛斯接收到一个或两个物件的叶脉和叶茎形成的鱼骨图案。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Two horizontal lines, rather widely separated from each other.”Since Jane had held the envelope to her forehead in the position above indicated, it can be seen that the “spines” of the two leaves, taped to the Bristol, would be roughly horizontal to the floor and thus to her vision. Provided Seth gives this data in our terms in such cases. We wondered if by horizontal Seth, or Jane, could possibly mean parallel, since the leaves are quite parallel to each other on the Bristol.</td><td>(“两条水平线，彼此相隔甚远。”由于珍以如上文所说的位置把信封放在她的额头上，因此可以看到两片贴在纸板上的叶子“脊柱”，相对于地板大约是水平的，所以在她看来也是。假如在这种情况下，赛斯按照我们的说法提供这个资料。那我们纳闷的是，赛斯或珍所谓的水平有没有可能是平行的意思，因为叶子在纸板上彼此相当平行。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth's use of the word separated here is the closest he came to indicating two objects.</td><td>(赛斯这里使用“分开”这个词，是他指称两个物件的用语当中最接近的一个。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A small star like shape, perhaps in the lower right hand corner, holding the object this way.” By now Jane had lowered the envelope to her lap while giving the data, and held it with a short edge up as explained. See my indication of this by use of the word top on the back of the tracing on page 189. I determined this as explained low on page 193. With the object held in this position, it can be seen that the smaller of the two poinsettia leaves would be in the lower right hand corner or the lower left hand corner, depending on whether the piece of Bristol to which the leaves were taped had the leaves facing toward Jane or away from her.</td><td>(“一个小小的像星星的形状，也许在右下角，用这种方式握住物件。”此时，珍在给出这个资料的同时，把信封放到她的大腿上，并按照解释过的方式握着短的那一边。见前面的描摹图，我用“上面”这个词来表示这一点。如前面的说明，是我决定这样做的。从物件的这个位置拿着它，可以看出两片圣诞红叶片当中比较小的一片位于右下角或左下角，取决于粘贴着叶子的其中一块纸板是朝向珍或背对她。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth uses the word perhaps here, so he may not have been sure, or Jane may have been a bit unsure. He does mention right hand corner. We believe the star like shape a good reference to the internal pattern of the leaf. This kind of radiating line pattern is one which Jane uses in her paintings, and in past experiments has been interpreted as “sun shape,” “star shape,” etc.</td><td>(赛斯这里用了“也许”这个词，所以他可能不太确定，或是珍可能有点不确定。他确实提到右下角。我们相信星形贴切地指出叶片的内部图案。这种辐射线条图案是珍在她画作中使用的一种图案，在过去的实验中被解读为“太阳形状”、“星形”等等。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with 1961.” The plant from which the two leaves were taken was once the property of our neighbor here in the apartment house, Miss Callahan, an elderly retired teacher. Jane first saw it in Miss Callahan's apartment at Christmas of1964, when Miss Callahan received it as a Christmas present.</td><td>(“和1961年有关联。”我们摘下了两片叶子的那棵植物曾经是我们的邻居在公寓这里的财产，卡拉汉小姐，一位退休老师。1964年的圣诞节，珍在卡拉汉小姐的公寓第一次见到它。它是卡拉汉小姐收到的一个圣诞礼物。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane immediately realized a poinsettia connection with 1961, however. In 1961, shortly after we had moved to Elmira, a friend with whom Jane worked at an art gallery gave her two poinsettia plants that we had for several years. This is easily remembered because the two 1961 plants are the only other poinsettias we have ever owned. We have for instance never bought a poinsettia plant for ourselves, or as a gift, etc.; the two 1961 plants and the plant which furnished the objects for tonight constitute the only three poinsettias we have been involved with. The 1961 plants were outright gifts. The third plant I found on the back porch of the apartment house last winter, where it had been discarded by Miss Callahan. More on this later.</td><td>(然而，珍立刻发觉圣诞红和1961年的关联。1961年，我们搬到埃尔迈拉之后不久，和珍一起在画廊工作的一个朋友送了她两棵圣诞红，我们养了它们好多年。这很容易记住，因为1961年的这两棵植物是我们有过的圣诞红当中唯一的另外两棵。比方说，我们从来没有为自己买过圣诞红，或买来送礼之类的；1961年的这两棵植物和为今晚提供物件的这一棵是唯一和我们有关系的3棵圣诞红。1961年的两棵植物是完全赠与的礼物。第三棵是去年冬天，我在公寓的后门廊发现的，卡拉汉小姐把它丢在那里。后面还有更多相关资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yellow and red.” The plant I acquired secondhand via Miss Callahan is the only poinsettia we have. The two 1961 plants died a couple of years ago. Oddly enough, none of our three plants have ever bloomed for us. Their blooms are red leaved, of course, with brilliant yellow centers; I have painted poinsettias many times on my job, for greeting card designs. Interestingly enough, Jane used to see our present plant in bloom in Miss Callahans apartment, before Miss Callahan disposed of it.</td><td>(“黄色和红色。”我从卡拉汉小姐那里接收的这棵二手植物是我们的圣诞红。1961年的两棵植物在一两年前死了。奇怪的是，我们这三棵植物都没有为我们开过花。它们的花朵是红色的。当然，还有鲜艳的黄色花心；我在工作中多次画过圣诞红，用于贺卡设计。有趣的是，珍曾经在卡拉汉小姐的公寓里看过我们现在这棵植物开花，在卡拉汉小姐丢弃它之前。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A tall tree, exceptionally tall, I believe.” The plant we now have, which furnished the leaves used as objects, is, we have been told, quite old and tall for a poinsettia. Many people have remarked about this. The plant stands perhaps three feet tall; this may have given rise to Seth's tall data here. The stems have acquired a woody, brown texture. In addition, the day I removed the leaves used as objects from the plant, it stood on our bathroom windowsill. This is quite high; the plant on the sill gave the illusion of reaching almost to the ceiling.</td><td>(“一棵高大的树，我相信，特别高。”我们被告知，我们现在这棵提供叶片用作标的物的植物，是相当老而且高大的圣诞红。很多人评论过它。这棵植物可能有三英尺高；可能因此才会有赛斯这里的高大资料。它的茎已经变木质，棕色的质地。此外，我摘下植物的叶片，用来当作标的物那天，它站在我们的浴室窗台上。这是相当高的；窗台上的植物给人一种几乎要碰到天花板的错觉。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Ruburt here thinks of his mother, Marie. We will simply mention it.” We don't know the source of this data. A childhood association of Jane’s, involving poinsettias?</td><td>(“鲁柏在这里想到他的母亲玛丽。我们会简单提一下。”我们不知道这个资料的来源。珍联想到童年，和圣诞红有关？</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with the month of February.” We don't know. At first Jane and I thought this might refer to the month I found the discarded poinsettia on the back porch last winter. It was a bitterly cold day and the plant had begun to wilt when I found it at noontime. However, upon reflection we realized we had the plant with us last Christmas.</td><td>(“和2月份有关联。”我们不知道。起初珍和我以为这可能是指我去年冬天在后门廊发现这棵被丢弃的圣诞红那个月。那一天冷得很，我在中午发现它的时候，它已经开始枯萎了。总之，仔细回想以后，我们发觉去年圣诞节我们就有这棵植物。</td></tr><tr><td>(“An initiation.” We don’t know.</td><td>(“一个开始。”我们不知道。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Something on the back or inside of the object. Did the object once open up? The impression of continued writing. A connection with a note, I believe, or a card that opened, with writing or copy on an inside page. Orange. The orange seems to be connected with black also. Or dark color. Perhaps like dark lettering.” These impressions came together, and we can offer no connections. Seth seems to be quite insistent upon the subject of writing or a note, so they may be valid. As stated, Jane saw the plant which furnished tonights objects, as a Christmas present in Miss Callahan's apartment at Christmas of1964. Jane considers it possible that here Seth is getting at the idea of a folded note or card being attached to the plant when Miss Callahan received it as a gif. However Jane can recall no such note or card upon seeing it in 1964. Nor can we check with Miss Callahan, who has suffered a considerable loss of memory as a result of a series of strokes since 1964.</td><td>(“某个在物件背面或里面的东西。这个物件曾经开启过吗？继续书写的印象。我相信和一张纸条，或打开的卡片有关联，在内页上有写的或复印的字。橙色。橙色似乎也和黑色有关联。或是深色。也许像深色的美术字。”这些印象汇集在一起，我们想不出任何关联。赛斯似乎相当坚持书写或一张纸条这个主题，所以它们可能是有效的。如上所述，1964年的圣诞节，珍在卡拉汉小姐的公寓看到了今晚提供物件的这棵植物，它是一个圣诞礼物。珍认为这里赛斯可能要表达的概念是一张折叠的纸条或卡片，在卡拉汉小姐收到这棵作为礼物的植物时，附在它上面。然而珍在1964年看到它的时候并不记得有这样的纸条或卡片。我们也不能找卡拉汉小姐核对，因为自从1964年以来，卡拉汉小姐一连串的中风，记忆丧失的状况相当严重。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The impression of a water connection.” There can be at least two. As stated, today the plant which furnished the leaves used as objects sat on our bathroom windowsill. Due to the architecture of our bathroom this puts it within a foot or so of our sink. Also, since it had been quite a hot day, Jane watered the plant again at supper time—something she usually doesn’t do at that time of day.</td><td>(“和水有关联的一个印象。”可能至少有两个。如上所述，今天提供叶片作为物件的植物，位在我们的浴室窗台上。由于浴室的建筑结构，它距离我们的水槽一英尺之内。此外，因为这一天非常炎热，所以珍在晚餐时间再次给这棵植物浇水——这是她通常不会在一天当中那个时候做的事。</td></tr><tr><td>(“With something beginning with an M, and something beginning with a G,” We didn't know, although we speculated that the initials were a distortion of Miss Callahan, or of Merry Christmas, both these ideas being related to the source of the poinsettia plant which furnished the leaves as objects. Seth helps us out on this after break.</td><td>(“和某个M开头的东西，以及某个G开头的东西有关联。”我们不知道，虽然我们推测这些首字母是卡拉汉小姐[Miss Callahan]或圣诞快乐[Merry Christmas]的扭曲，但这两个想法都和提供叶片作为物品的这棵圣诞红所来之处有关。赛斯在休息后帮助我们解决这个问题。</td></tr><tr><td>(“and with four objects.” We saw no connections.</td><td>(“也和4个物件有关联。”我们没有看到任何关联。</td></tr><tr><td>(My first question asked Seth for more data about the two horizontal lines. See page 194. “1 have the impression of two dark horizontal lines, one rather toward the top and one rather toward the bottom.” [Jane gestures.] It will be remembered that when Seth gave this data the first time, Jane held the envelope to her forehead with its long dimensions horizontal to the floor. As explained, this meant the spines of the two leaves were also roughly horizontal to the floor and her insight. Seth elaborates a bit here now, although Jane now sat holding the envelope in her lap, and with its short dimensions parallel to the floor.</td><td>(我的第一个问题是要求赛斯给更多两条水平线的资料。见前面。“我有两条深色水平线的印象，一条比较朝着上方，另一条比较朝着下方。”[珍比手势]记得赛斯第一次给出这个资料时，珍把信封放在她的额头上，它的长边对比地板是水平的。之前解释过，这是说两片叶子的中肋相对于地板和她的视线大致也是水平的，赛斯现在详述了一下，虽然珍这时坐着，手握着信封在她的大腿上，而且短边和地板是平行的。</td></tr><tr><td>(When the envelope is held in the horizontal position, the spine of one of the leaves is above the other, or one toward the top and the other toward the bottom. They are not dark, however. In poinsettia leaves at least, the central spine is a lighter green color than the rest of the leaf.</td><td>(当信封保持在水平位置时，其中一片叶子的中肋就在另一片的上方，或者一片朝上，另一片朝下。但它们并不是深色的。至少在圣诞红的叶子上，比起叶片的其余部分，中肋是更浅的绿色。</td></tr><tr><td>(More data follows from the first question: “Both inside, but just an oval shape. Holding the object this way. " [Jane gestured again, the envelope in the same position, short end up.] From this we infer that Seth refers to the spines of the leaves, and not their stems; yet mention is made only of an oval shape, singular.</td><td>(更多资料来自第一个问题：“两条都在里面，但只是一个椭圆形状。以这种方式握住物件。”[珍又比了手势，信封在同一位置，短边朝上。]由此我们推断赛斯指的是叶子的中肋，而不是它们的茎；可是他提到只是由单一一个椭圆形构成的。</td></tr><tr><td>( I now asked Seth to name the object: “ I have the impression, holding the object this way” [gesture in the same fashion as above], “of a rectangular object, a card that is connected with a picture ", resulted in Jane having a mental image here. She saw, she said, the rectangular shape of the Bristol to which I had taped the two leaves. She also had an image of something darker in the center of the rectangle, and interpreted this as a picture instead of “something real.” Upon seeing the object, Jane realized the dark areas of the leaves matched the dark areas she had seen mentally, yet the image hadn’t been sharp enough to see as leaves; it came through in a generalized picture interpretation instead.</td><td>(我这时要求赛斯指出物件名称：“我有一个印象，这样握住物件，[比了和上面一样的手势]是一个长方形物件，一张卡片，和一幅图片有关联，”结果这里珍因此有了一个心象。她说，她看到我把两片叶子贴在上面的纸板是长方形。她还有一个意象是，这个长方形的正中央有某个颜色更深的东西，把它解读为照片而不是“真实的东西”。在看到物件之后，珍发觉叶片的深色区域与她心象里的深色区域一致，但这个意象没有清晰到看见是叶子；反之，它传过来的形式是一般的图片解读。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth added more as a result of the second question: “and strongly connected with something that opened, as a letter could open to another page.” We believe this data to be separate from that in the paragraph just above. Once again Seth brings in the writing connection, previously described on page 196. We can offer no interpretations here, either.</td><td>(赛斯因为第二个问题又补充更多：“也和某个打开的东西有很大的关联，就像可以打开另一页的一封信。”我们相信这个资料与上一段的资料是分开的。再一次，赛斯提到书写的关联，这在之前描述过。这里我们一样提不出任何解读。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Also a dim connection with the word, master. Master list, I do not know.” Nor do we.</td><td>(“还有一个和“主要的”(master)这个词隐约有关的连结。主要的清单(master list)，我不知道。”我们也不知道。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed briefly at 10:47.)</td><td>(10:47，珍又继续一会儿。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will close our session.</td><td>我们要结束我们的课了。</td></tr><tr><td>There was a visual distortion. We should have had M C, rather than G.</td><td>有一个视觉的扭曲。我们应该有M C，而不是MG。</td></tr><tr><td>(Which leaves us just about where we were—Miss Callahan, Merry Christmas...?)</td><td>(这正好让我们回到原点——卡拉汉小姐，圣诞快乐……？)</td></tr><tr><td>My heartiest regards. I would speak with you longer, but my friend Ruburt has said good night to me, and as always I respect his wishes.</td><td>我最诚挚的问候。我会和你说更久，但我的朋友鲁柏跟我说了晚安，而我一如既往，尊重他的意愿。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good night, Seth.”</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 10:48.

The session did not particularly grow out of the evenings conversation; perhaps more so from a short discussion Jane and I held when we were alone at last.</td><td>(5月29日星期天晚上，在客人离开后，举行了一节非常短的临时课。这一节并不是特别从今晚的谈话延伸出来的；或许比较可能的起因是，在珍和我终于独处的时候，我们有过一个简短的讨论。</td></tr><tr><td>(The first part of the session is summarized, the notes being made immediately, at 11:28. The balance of the session is verbatim as indicated. Jane first came through as Seth while sitting at ease on the couch. We had been wondering aloud if the bulk of the material would ever be published verbatim. Seth came through to say quite definitely that the material would be published verbatim—not all of it, literally, but certain large areas of it. He did not give a date or year, etc., and I did not ask.</td><td>(在11:28分，做了总结这一节的第一个部分，也立刻写了笔记。剩下的部分则是逐字记录，如下所示。珍首先以赛斯的身分过来了，当时她正轻松地坐在沙发上。我们一直出声问道，这一大堆的资料到底会不会逐字出版。赛斯过来，相当肯定地说，这份资料将会逐字出版——不是全部，确切地说，是它很大的某些部分。他没有给出日期或年份等等，我也没问。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth told us the Seth book which is now at Jane's publisher would be published, and that her dream book would also. Jane sent the dream book to another publisher last week. After a pause Seth said the verbatim material would be published also, but gave no hint of a date.</td><td>(赛斯告诉我们，此时在珍那家出版社的赛斯书将会出版，她那本梦书也会出版。珍上周把梦书寄到另一家出版社。停顿一下之后，赛斯说这份逐字资料也会出版，但是他没有给任何有关日期的线索。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth then went on to say that the bridge personality would be dispensed with eventually, because it would no longer be needed. See sessions 141. 143.</td><td>(赛斯接着说，桥梁人格最终会免除，因为不再需要它。见第141至143节。</td></tr><tr><td>(After receiving the above material I moved over to a table to make notes on it. Jane sat opposite me, her eyes closed part of the time, and resumed as Seth at 11:28.)</td><td>(接收到上面的资料之后，我移到一张桌子上做笔记。珍坐在我对面，有一部分时间，她的眼睛是闭着的，在11:28分以赛斯的身分继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>You will do very well financially in the next few years—so well in fact that you, Joseph, will feel yourself compelled to sell your paintings in order to hold your own. An absurd compulsion, I might add. (Smile, eyes closed.)</td><td>在接下来的几年里，你的账务状况会很好——事实上，约瑟，你会觉得你被迫出售自己的画作，以便撑下去。我可能补充说，这是一种荒谬的强迫心理。(微笑，闭着眼睛)</td></tr><tr><td>There will be new developments in our sessions, and new experiments with others, as a result of Ruburt's first book.</td><td>由于鲁柏的第一本书，我们的课将会有新的发展，并且进行其他方面的新实验。</td></tr><tr><td>Simply note this: 5 and 7 and Tennessee, the 5 and 7 the numbers of letters in a name. Now, and’s and a G, and there will be physical signs for dear Ruburt, when the time comes for physical signs.</td><td>只需注意这一点：5和7以及田纳西州，5和7是一个名字里面的数量。现在，还有S和一个G，在物质征象出现的时机到了，亲爱的鲁柏就会有物质征象。</td></tr><tr><td>I will not keep you.</td><td>我不会耽误你太久。</td></tr><tr><td>(“That’s all right.

Once again, I am with you more often than you suppose, and I shall be with you this evening when you dream.</td><td>一个4和一个6，两者之间有一个方块，这个方块和一段时间有关。再一次，我和你们在一起的次数比你们以为的多，今晚在你们做梦的时候，我会和你们在一起。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Are we going to dream of you?’’)</td><td>(“我们会梦见你吗？”)</td></tr><tr><td>You may not dream of me, but I will be in your dreams, you see. My heartiest wishes to you both. The street in Boston had to do with the word bleak.</td><td>你们可能不会梦见我，但我会在你们的梦中，你知道。给你们两位我最衷心的祝福。波士顿的街道与荒凉一词有关。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Bleak? B-l-e-a-k?”</td><td>(“荒凉？b-l-e-a-k？”</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane nodded, her eyes closed.</td><td>(珍点点头，闭着眼睛。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 11:34. Jane said she was very well dissociated. Her eyes had been open about half the time. The mention of Boston occurred we supposed because a little earlier we had spoken of the Boston reincarnational material Seth had given us in the 257th session.)</td><td>(11:34结束。她说她相当出离。她的眼睛张开大约一半的时间。之所以提到波士顿，我们认为是因为早些时候我们曾经谈到波士顿转世的资料，赛斯在第257节给了我们那个资料。</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 264</td><td>第264节 解释珍和罗的投射梦</td></tr><tr><td>JUNE 1, 1966 9 PM MONDAY</td><td>1966年6月1日 星期一 晚上9点</td></tr><tr><td>(The session due Monday, May 30, was not held due to my own indisposition.

I believe I also fell into inconsequential dreaming or sleep after the last event.</td><td>(就连续情境而言，这些事件有些我不确定，也相信有些经验本身我忘掉了。我相信在最后一个事件之后，我也进入无关紧要的梦状态或睡眠状态中。</td></tr><tr><td>( I see plants I have planted long ago; flourishing and beautiful, and can be used for decorating or repotted. I think that here I had a false awakening and told Rob about the beautiful plants. I also thought they were symbolic of the work put into my books. It is possible that this was preceded by a levitation dream.</td><td>(我看到我很久以前种的植物；繁茂又美丽，可以用来装饰或移植。我想这里我有过一次假醒，告诉了罗这些美丽的植物。我也认为它们象征我为我的书所下的工夫。这可能是在一个漂浮梦之前。</td></tr><tr><td>(The false awakening: I tell Rob about the plants, and perhaps make a note to record the dream. “Then I realize this is a false awakening, and that I should be able to project. I am sitting in the bathroom when I realize this. I try to levitate or project. I hold my legs out and my feet feel strange: There is an odd sensation, a shifting of some kind. Then I really project. There is an experience of seeing many mirrors, through which I travel. The mirrors are not solid. Feeling of motion, and the mirror scenes also move.”</td><td>(假醒：我告诉罗有关植物的事，也许还记下这个梦。“然后发觉这是假醒，所以我应该能够投射。当我发觉这件事的时候，我坐在浴室里。我试着漂浮或投射。我伸出双腿，脚感觉很奇怪；有一种奇怪的感觉，一种变化。然后我真的投射了。有一个看到很多镜子的经验，我穿过镜子而去。镜子并不坚实。移动的感觉，镜子的场景也在移动。”</td></tr><tr><td>( I was in a landscape with two women. We were leaders of some kind. Running over the hills, I leap from ground to a high ledge. I am not satisfied with the leap, so move “backward through the air" to my original spot, and do the whole thing over. Then I have another false awakening in which I tell Rob about the dream and levitation.</td><td>(我和两个女人在一个景观里。我们是某种领导者。跑过山庄，我从地面跳到高高的岩架。这一跳我不满意，所以“往后穿过空中”移动到原来的位置，再重复整个过程一遍。然后我又有一次假醒，我告诉罗这个梦和漂浮的事。</td></tr><tr><td>(Then I'm in a house of our friends Lydia and Atlee; many kids and animals. “ I talk to Rob. He is in one room and I am in a hallway. Suddenly I see two Robs: Rob’s double is in another room, that I can also see from my viewpoint. I keep talking to Rob and tell him to stay where he is. Then I check, moving closer to the other room. Sure enough I can see both Robs clearly. They both talk, so I tell Rob to come into the hall so he can see what I see. He does, and both Robs see each other. Others, hearing us, see both Robs also.”</td><td>(然后我在我们的朋友莉蒂亚[Lydia]和亚特力[Atlee]的房子里；很多小孩和动物。“我跟罗说话。他在一个房间里，我在走廊。突然间我看到两个罗：罗的分身在另一个房间，从我的视角也可以看到他。我一直跟罗说话，叫他留在原地。然后我检查一下，往另一个房间靠近一点。果然我可以清楚看见两个罗。两个都在说话，所以我叫罗进来走廊，这样他就看得到我看到的场景。他照办，两个罗看见彼此。其他听到我们的人也看到了两个罗。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Then Lizzie Roohan calls out to me from next door and I go over to see her. She is younger than I remember her; perhaps in her fifties. There is a fabulous cultivated garden nearby, perhaps several of them. Also perhaps some difficulty about neighbors who wouldn’t keep up their own land.</td><td>(然后莉兹·如翰[Lizzie Roohan ]在隔壁房间叫我，我便过去见她。她比我记忆的她还要年轻；也许50多岁。附近有一个栽植花木的美妙庭园，也许有好几个。此外，邻居也许遇到一些困难，所以没有维护他们自己的土地。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's notes concerning the dream: The actual separation from physical body is the most vivid experience of the whole sequence—if separation is what it was. This is the first time I definitely realized I had a false awakening, then consciously tried to project from it. I certainly seemed to do so.</td><td>(珍记下这个梦的笔记：实际与身体分离是整个连续情境中最生动的经验——如果分享就是这样的话。这是我第一次明确知道我有一次假期，然后有意识地尝试从它这里投射出去。我当然好像这么做了。</td></tr><tr><td>(The following dream and experience is from my notebook for the night of Tuesday, May 31:</td><td>(以下的梦和经验来自我在5月31日星期二晚上的笔记：</td></tr><tr><td>(In full vivid color. One of the most unusual dreams I have ever had. There are probably gaps in my recall of it.</td><td>(色彩饱满生动。我曾经有过最不寻常的梦之一。我对它的记忆可能有空白。</td></tr><tr><td>( I stood on a narrow ledge at night, on a cliff side, with several men I knew well in the dream but not in waking life. There was, a fire burning in a circle of stone at our feet, and we all held long poles like broom handles. I dropped a lighted match into a littered ashtray, which flamed up; when I tried to put the fire out I found I couldn’t.</td><td>(晚上，我站在一个狭窄的岩夹上，在一座悬崖边，和几个我在梦中很熟但醒时生活不相熟的男人在一块。在我们脚边的一圈石头当中，有火在烧，而且我们全都拿着像扫帚柄的长棍。我把一支点过的火柴丢进一个凌乱的烟灰缸，结果烧了起来；我设法扑灭火苗，却发现我做不到。</td></tr><tr><td>(Then I was watching the fire spread in the stone fireplace. Once again trying to put it out, I poked it with my stick. Instead I knocked chunks of ground out of the bottom of the circle, and could look through space at other cliffs and trails far below. At the same time the others with me cautioned me to stop poking. I realized now that the end of our ledge was held up now by only a thin column of stone, but didn't feel alarmed at this. The stone column seemed to be aglow, or hot.</td><td>(然后我看着火蔓延到石头火炉内。再一次设法灭火，我用棍子戳它。结果我反而从圆圈的底部敲下一块块地面，从中空处可以看到远处下方的其他悬崖和小径。同时，其他人告诫我不要再戳了。我现在才发觉，我们的岩架末端现在只靠一根薄薄的石柱顶着，但对此却不觉得惊慌。石柱似乎烧得通红或发热。</td></tr><tr><td>(Then I was on a vacation trip in the tropics. I believe the same group was with me. I had a pair of binoculars to watch others on the trails. There was a woman here in the dream but her role is beyond my accurate recall.</td><td>(然后我在热带地区度假。我相信同一群人和我在一起。我用一副双筒望远镜观察步道上的其他人。梦中这里有一个女人，但她的角色我记不太清楚。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now one of my close friends— I cannot recall his name, if I ever knew it—was due to ski down one of the trails. I was very concerned for his safety. The man, in a green uniform, sailed down a trail and into the air. At this time I seemed to be in a bed, suspended first over the trails, and then in a room.</td><td>(现在我的一个亲近的朋友——我想不起他的名字，如果我知道的话——正要滑下其中一条小径。我非常担心他的安全。这个男人穿着绿色制服，沿着小径而下，滑翔到空中。这时我似乎在床上，先是悬吊在小径上方，然后在一个房间里。</td></tr><tr><td>(My friend was now either a miniature man, or very far away; actually I am quite sure he was miniature size. I saw him coming in for a landing, tiny and green and apparently out of control. He swooped down beside my bed, skidded along the top of a covered radiator, crashed into a wall and fell down onto another radiator top at a lower level. The landing was very rough and I cried out in dismay as my fiend bounced and skidded around. I believe he was about four inches tall, and I saw his skis twisted over each other as he fell.</td><td>(我的朋友现在要不是个迷你版的男人，就是离得很远；实际上我很确定他的身体尺寸是迷你的。我看到他出现，准备着陆，小小的、绿绿的，显然失控。他突然跳到我的床边，沿着一台有盖子的电热器顶端滑行，撞到一面墙上，倒在另一个位置较低的电热器顶端。着陆非常艰难，我沮丧得哭了起来，这时我的朋友四处弹跳滚滑。我相信他大约4英寸高，我看到他的滑雪板在他摔倒时缠在一起。</td></tr><tr><td>( I was so concerned for my fiend’s safety and welfare that I scooped him up in my hands, and held him between them like a child holds a trapped fly. I then felt my tiny friend, who by now seemed to be even smaller, buzzing and banging against my palms, trying to get out.</td><td>(我非常担心我朋友的安全和健康，我用手把他舀起来，像一个孩子捧着一只受困的苍蝇那样捧着它。然后我感觉我这迷你的朋友——现在看起来更小——冲撞着我的掌心，设法离开。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now I was in a shack in the tropics, again at night, with the rest of the group. I still held my green friend inside my cupped hands. I felt him buzzing, very vividly, still trying to escape. We stood before a crude wooden table we were going to use as an operating table. I was going to operate, or somehow bring my friend back to fill size. I saw no instruments. The shack was lit by glowing kerosene lanterns, or some kind of such yellow light. I think it was quite dirty.</td><td>(现在我在热带的小木屋里，又是晚上，和这个团体的其他人一起。我仍然双手呈杯状捧着我的绿色朋友。我感觉他四处横冲直撞，非常生动，还在努力逃脱中。我们站在一张未经加工的木桌前。我们打算用它当手术台。我打算动手术，或以某种方式让我的朋友恢复原来的大小。我没有看到任何器械。发光的煤油灯或其他像这样的某种黄光照亮小木屋。我认为它很脏。</td></tr><tr><td>(Then I saw that someone had left the shack’s door open, and that everything, the walls, the ceiling, the open door, etc., was covered with hordes of insects of various kinds and colors, all crawling and flying about. This made me very angry, for as I felt my friend buzzing inside my hands, I wondered how I would know him from any other insect once I released him in order to help him. (Jane began speaking in a rather quiet voice and with quite a few pauses. Her eyes were closed to begin, but she was smoking and they soon began to open frequently.)</td><td>(然后我看到有人让小木屋的门开着，每一样东西，墙壁、天花板、敞开的门等等都覆盖着种类和颜色各异的昆虫，全部爬来爬去、飞来飞去。这让我非常生气，因为当我感觉我的朋友在我手中到处冲撞时，我不知道一旦我为了帮他而放开他，要怎样才能从任何其他昆虫当中认出他来。(珍一开始用一种相当安静的声音说话，并且停顿好多次。她的眼睛一开始闭着，但是她在抽烟，所以很快就开始睁开了。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>First, some general comments. You are both learning rather quickly. Ruburts projection from the dream state, through a false awakening, was indeed legitimate. He gave himself no suggestion beforehand, yet the overall suggestions that he has given himself stood him in good stead.</td><td>首先是一些一般的评论。你们俩人都在快速学习中。鲁柏透过假醒从梦状态投射确实是合理的。他事先没有给自己任何暗示，但他给自己的整体暗示对他有利。</td></tr><tr><td>The mirror however is the mirror in your bedroom. He projected through this physical matter without realizing that he did so.</td><td>不过，镜子是你卧室里的镜子。他投射穿过这个实物，却不晓得自己这样做了。</td></tr><tr><td>Now your own dream, Joseph, also involved projection, but with less intent behind it, and some less control, though very little control occurred in either case. You will learn control as you go along.</td><td>现在，你自己的梦，约瑟，也和投射有关，但在它背后的意图比较少，控制也比较少，不过，在两种情况下都有非常少的控制。随着你的进展，你将学会控制。</td></tr><tr><td>On Ruburts part we had a definite manipulation of consciousness that was directed to some extent. You projected once into the past, and I was one of your friends. This episode was the less distorted. One episode involved a small future projection, and was intermixed with ordinary dream elements. This involved the operating episode.</td><td>在鲁柏的部分，我们有一种明确的意识操纵，这种操纵是受到某种程度指挥的。你曾经投射到过去一次，我是你的朋友之一。这个情节比较没有扭曲。一个和未来一个小投射有关的情节，并与普通的梦元素混合在一起。这和手术情节有关。</td></tr><tr><td>The miniature episode is extremely interesting, and rather complicated to explain. (Pause.) Give us a moment here. (Pause, eyes closed.)</td><td>迷你版情节非常有趣，解释起来相当复杂。(停顿)这里给我们一点时间。(停顿，闭着眼睛)</td></tr><tr><td>First of all, the episode involved a transitory period, to bring you to the operation situation. The means chosen by you originally was somewhat different. You intended to project yourself into one of the small insects in the room, you see, but you were unable to do so.</td><td>首先，这个情节和一个短暂的时期有关，把你带去手术情境中，你最初选择的方法有些不同。你打算把自己投射到房间里的一只小昆虫之中，但是你无法这么做。</td></tr><tr><td>The original fear for your friend was a sympathetic fear of a patient, who was to be operated on. The particular patient had chills, hence your interpretation of the skiing episode, and snow.</td><td>最初为你朋友担忧的恐惧，是对一个即将动手术的病人感到同情的恐惧。这一名病人有风寒，所以才会有你的滑雪事件解读，以及雪。</td></tr><tr><td>There was a definite projection, however, to the psychic healer's shack. I was involved here also, rather good-naturedly, hoping to help you.</td><td>然而，是有一个到心灵疗愈小木屋的明确投射。这里我也参与其中，相当出于好意，希望能帮到你。</td></tr><tr><td>We will skip a bit around here. The plants in Ruburts dream did represent the books upon which he has worked and is working. The projection was quite legitimate. The Lydia episode contained many ordinary dream elements. You were indeed present, (smile) with Ruburt in some of his travels, but you have forgotten.</td><td>这里我们要跳过一下。鲁柏梦中的植物确实代表他已经写和正在写的书。这个投射非常合理。丽蒂亚情节包含许多普通的梦元素。在鲁柏的一些旅行中，你确实在场，(微笑)但你已经忘记了。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt saw two of you. He saw your form number two as described earlier, in which you were also traveling, you see. (See the 262ndsession.) The other was Ruburt’s dream form of you, created by himself in the dream state. When you appeared in form two he was conscious enough, you see, to recognize your arrival, and then to point out to you the dream image which he had already created. And you were able to see it because of your own state.</td><td>鲁柏看见你们两个。他看到你的形式二——之前描述过——你知道，你是用那个形式在旅行。(见第262节)另一个是你在鲁柏梦中的形式，这是他在梦状态中创造出来的。当你以形式二的样子出现时，他有意识的程度，你知道，足以认出你的到来，然后他把已经创造的梦形象指出来给你看。而你当时之所以能够看到它，是因为你自己的状态。</td></tr><tr><td>Now when Ruburt dreams that he has discussed a dream with you, in most cases he has indeed done so. You have both conversed quite naturally in forms number two. With enough training, these conversations can be recorded in both of your dreams. The amount of work necessary is literally astounding, but I tell you that you can both do this; and you can make general, through your work, a knowledge of the true potential of the dream state.</td><td>现在，当鲁柏梦见他和你讨论过一个梦时，大多数情况下他确实是这样做了。你们两人在第二种形式中很自然地交谈了。经由足够的训练，这些对话可以记录在你们两人的梦中。必要的工作量确实是惊人的，但我告诉你，你们两人都可以这样做；你可以透过你的工作，大致了解梦状态的真实潜力。</td></tr><tr><td>You have both advanced, particularly you see because you do not have the ego to contend with as an adversary. The quest has become a part of your egotistical concern. Therefore it will work for you. (Long pause. Eyes open, then closed. Smoking.)</td><td>你们两个都有进步，尤其是，你看，因为你没有自我这个对手在跟你对抗。这种探索已经成为自我关切之事的一部分。因此它对你是有用的。(长时间停顿。睁开眼睛，然后闭上。抽着烟。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. The small friend is rather difficult to explain in your experience. The color green is also amusing. You were the friend, you see—</td><td>现在。这个小小的朋友很难用你的经验来解释。绿色也很有趣。你就是这个朋友，你看——</td></tr><tr><td>(“ I wondered about that. ")</td><td>(“我怀疑过这件事。”)</td></tr><tr><td>—wanting to project as a green insect. The idea was too alien, and you split your consciousness so that you watched the small man in green.</td><td>——想要投射成为绿色的昆虫，这个想法太奇异了，于是你分裂你的意识，好让你看到绿色的小男人。</td></tr><tr><td>We will take a break, and continue.</td><td>我们休息一下，然后继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27.

This is not the full account reproduced in this session but a summary containing the main points of the dream.</td><td>(我在5月31日星期二晚上做了梦，然后在隔天上午上班前写下了我的记述。这一节转载并不是记述的全文，而是摘要，包含了这个梦的主要重点。</td></tr><tr><td>(On Wednesday, at about noon, Jane bought the July issue q/Tate Magazine. It contains a long article about a Philippine psychic surgeon who is being brought to this country next fall, when he is to operate on patients with surgeons and others as witnesses. The article goes into detail about the scientists who have watched the psychic surgeon operate at his home in the Philippines, and about the surgeons home and “operating room,” which is but a shack containing a crude wooden-slatted table. Although the surgeons surroundings are not sanitary, no case of infection has been traced to him.</td><td>(星期三，大约中午，珍买了7月份的《命运杂志》。它刊载了一篇关于菲律宾一位通灵外科医生的长文，明年秋天他会被请到这个国家来，届时他将会同外科医生和其他人为病患动手术。这篇文章详细介绍那些观察过通灵外科医生在菲律宾家中动手术的科学家们，以及这位外科医生的家和“手术室”，那只是一间小木屋，里面有一张未经加工的木板桌。虽然这个外科医生的周围环境不卫生，却没有任何感染病例可以追溯到他身上。</td></tr><tr><td>( I noticed the similarity between the last part of my dream, wherein I was to operate without instruments in a tropical shack, amid surroundings not clean and containing insects, etc., and the description of the psychic surgeons quarters, and that his shack was situated in the tropics. I explained it to Jane at break and hoped Seth would comment as to any clairvoyant elements in the dream.</td><td>(我注意到我最后一部分的梦——我在一间热带小木屋里，置身不干净又有昆虫的环境中，在没有任何器械的情况下动手术——以及通灵外科医生住所的描述，还有他的小木屋位于热带地区之间的相似处。我在休息时向珍解释这一点，希望赛斯会评论梦中的任何千里眼性质的元素。</td></tr><tr><td>(On Tuesday, before the dream, I remember thinking casually about Fate Magazine, and that perhaps a new issue was out. The thought was quite brief and without emphasis. I do not know when the magazine comes out, although I suppose it is on the first of the month or thereabouts. I did not mention my thought to Jane. I was alone when I had it; I was therefore a little surprised to see that she had bought the magazine the next day, Wednesday, but the surprise was not connected with my recalling my dream. Until I read over my notes Wednesday evening I had forgotten the dream.</td><td>(星期二，在这个梦之前，我记得偶尔想到《命运杂志》，也许是新的一期出刊了。这个念头非常短暂，也没有多加强调。我不知道杂志什么时候出刊，虽然我认为是每个月的第一天左右。我没有对珍提到我的念头。这个念头来的时候，我独自一个人；因此，看到她在隔天，星期三，买了这本杂志时，我有点惊讶，但这个惊讶和我想起我的梦没有任何关联。到星期三晚上看过我的笔记为止，我已经忘记这个梦。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed at 9:32.)</td><td>(珍于9:32继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>This will be a short session.</td><td>这将是一节短课。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. You did clairvoyantly see the article in Fate Magazine.</td><td>现在，你的确以千里眼的方式看到命运杂志的这篇文章。</td></tr><tr><td>Your various complaints this week were connected with Ruburt’s painting and housecleaning. The housecleaning connection I believe you understand.</td><td>这个星期你的各种抱怨与鲁柏刷油漆和打扫家里有关。我相信你了解打扫家里的这个关联。</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes.” Through the pendulum.)</td><td>(“是的。”通过灵摆。)</td></tr><tr><td>The painting connection is not difficult. You felt guilty because you have not offered to help paint your parents’ home, inside or outside, although your mother has dropped frequent and heavy hints. Both of these feelings were activated because of Ruburt's activities. (Pause.)</td><td>作画这个关联不难了解。你感到内疚，因为你的母亲虽然已经放弃频繁又强烈的暗示，但你并没有提出要帮忙，为你父母家的里面或外面刷油漆。因为鲁柏从事的活动，所以这两个感觉都被激发了。(停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>The canker sores should clear up and give you no difficulty. (Jane lit a cigarette, her eyes open and very dark.) They are connected here also. You believe them to be the result of infection caused by uncleanliness, you see. (Smile.) Do you understand this connection?</td><td>口腔溃疡应该都消失了，没有给你任何难题。(珍点了一支烟，她的眼睛睁开，颜色很深。)它们在这里也有关联。你知道，你认为它们是因为不干净导致感染的结果。(微笑)你了解这个关联吗?</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes:)</td><td>(“了解。”)</td></tr><tr><td>The whole episode however, once it happened, was very well handled by you. (Pause.) Give us a moment.</td><td>然而，整个事件一发生，你处理得非常好。(停顿)给我们一点时间。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused again at 9:37. Her eyes were closed, and they remained closed even though she smoked while giving the Dr. Instream material. Her head was down and she sat with a hand raised to it. This is the 67th Dr. Instream experiment.)</td><td>(9:37，珍再次停顿。她的眼睛闭着，即使她在给殷斯翠姆博士的资料时抽着烟，它们还是闭着。她的头朝下，而且她坐着，一只手举起来放在头上。这是第67次殷斯翠姆博士实验。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now for Dr. Instream. Monday. The object was composed of four squares. Either it was transparent, appeared so, or was connected with something transparent. There may have been a small series of numbers in each of the four squares—several numbers, perhaps. (This material for Monday, May 30.)</td><td>现在来谈殷斯翠姆博士。星期一。物件由4个正方形组成。要不是透明的，看起来是这样，要不就是和某个透明的东西有关联。(这是5月30日星期一的资料。)</td></tr><tr><td>The object itself had something to do with a box, or box shape, that was a container. Several bright colors, and some dull.</td><td>物件本身与一个盒子或盒子形状有关联，它是一个容器。几个鲜艳的颜色，有些是暗色。</td></tr><tr><td>(Pause at 9:39. This is the 68th Dr. Instream experiment.) Tonight’s object is shaped like an arrow or sword, but smaller, and seems to be either dull, or sharp on one side and dull on the other, of a dull gold color, and with a rounded top.</td><td>(9:39停顿。这是第68次殷斯翠姆博士实验。)今晚的物件形状像箭头或剑，但更小，似乎不是锋利，就是一边锋利，另一边不锋利，颜色是暗金色，顶端是圆的。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, not connected with the object, I have the impression of gray view, and perhaps the initials J P, or B. I believe P is correct. The number three, referring to a day or a month in connection with the initials, and something a score of times.</td><td>现在，和物件没有关联，我有灰色风景的印象，也许首字母是J P或B，我相信P是正确的。数字3，指的是和首字母有关的一天或一个月，以及某件有十几次的事。</td></tr><tr><td>A separate impression now... 1886, in connection with a book he may be reading. (Pause.)</td><td>现在是个别的一个印象……1886年，和他可能正在读的一本书有关联。(停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>Now I will close the session, or after a break you may continue as you see fit.</td><td>现在我要结束这一节了，或者在休息之后，你认为合适的话，也可以继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Well take the break then.”)</td><td>(“那我们休息吧。”)</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:44. Jane was out as usual; her eyes had been closed as indicated.</td><td>(9:44休息。珍仍像往常一样出去了；她的眼睛如上所述是闭着的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth’s material on page 204 agreed with what I had learned myself by using the pendulum, both today and earlier in the week. I hadn't told Jane what results or answers I obtained through the pendulum.</td><td>(前面的赛斯资料与我今天和本周早些时候使用摆钟得知的资料是一致的。我没有告诉珍我透过摆钟得到的结果或答案是什么。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed at 9:57.)</td><td>(珍于9:57继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>It is important for your training and development that consciousness be brought into the dream state.</td><td>对你的训练和发展来说，重要的是，把意识带入梦状态。</td></tr><tr><td>Projection is a normal occurrence under dream conditions. However for the further development of consciousness and of identity, the so-called waking I can be of great benefit.</td><td>在梦的状况中投射是正常现象。然而对于意识和本体的进一步发展而言，所谓“醒时的我”(Waking I)可能裨益良多。</td></tr><tr><td>You will learn to manipulate and control various levels of awareness, and the habit will carry over into other aspects of reality. With continued development you will be able to keep appointments and pass information in the dream state, and have your records to prove it.</td><td>你将学会操纵和控制各种层次的觉知，这种习惯会延伸到实相的其他方面。只要持续发展下去，你就能够在梦状态中赴约和传递资讯，并拥有你的记录以兹证明。</td></tr><tr><td>The trick is to achieve the proper balance. As Ruburt discovered, you can try too hard to take waking consciousness into the dream state, so that you simply cannot sleep as easily. Trial and error will show you the proper balance, and each successful attempt gives you added experience and control.</td><td>诀窍是达成适当的平衡。正如鲁柏的发现，你可能过度用力，要把醒时意识带进梦状态中，以至于无法轻易入睡。试验和错误会让你明白什么是适当的平衡，而每一次成功的尝试都会给你更多经验和控制力。</td></tr><tr><td>Later your experiences themselves, within a dream, will tip you off as to which form you are using, so that you will know what is possible under these particular conditions.</td><td>之后，你在梦中的经验会让你了解你正在使用的形式，这样你就会知道在这些特定状况下可能发生什么。</td></tr><tr><td>If you want to record any given experience in its clearest form, then you should train yourself to wake up immediately afterward. Otherwise later ordinary dreams will be remembered falsely as being part of the projection experience.</td><td>如果你想以最清晰的形式记录任何既定的经验，那你应该训练自己事后立即醒来。否则后来就无法如实记住普通梦，因为它是投射经验的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I will end the session, so you can have some small relief in typing. I will see, again, this evening, if we cannot all meet in your experiences.

The object was a faded color Polaroid photograph. The picture was taken by Don Wilbur on April 4,1966, as noted on the back. Don and his wife Marilyn were due to witness the 248th session on April 4, but last-minute developments prevented them doing so. Don left the sealed envelope he had prepared for the session with me, however; I kept it until the Wilburs were able to witness a session. The photo is of a decorative garden cat, bearing a shining glass glaze, and was made by Marilyn.</td><td>(第58次信封实验于今晚举行。物件是一张褪色的拍立得照片。如背面所示。照片由唐∙韦伯于1966年4月4日拍摄。唐和他的妻子玛丽莲预定见证4月4日的第248节，但是最后一刻的发展阻止他们这样做。然而，唐把他为那一节准备的密封信封留给我；我保留了它。直到韦伯夫妇能来见证一节课为止。这张照片是装饰花园的一只猫，上了闪亮的玻璃釉，由玛丽莲制作而成。</td></tr><tr><td>( I did not know the contents of the envelope, nor of course did Jane. She had seen Don hand me the envelope on April 4, but since none of us had ever mentioned it since then I was hoping she had forgotten about it. After the session tonight Jane confirmed she had forgotten that I had the envelope. Even when the Wilburs arrived for the session tonight, Jane did not remember it.</td><td>(我不知道信封的内容，当然珍也不知道，她在4月4日看到唐把信封递给我，但是从那时起，我们都没有提起过它，所以我希望她已经忘了它。今晚课后，珍确认她已经忘记我有这个信封。即使今晚韦伯夫妇到场参加这一节，珍也不记得它。</td></tr><tr><td>(By coincidence Don had sealed the object in an envelope of the same size as those I use for the experiments. He did not use double envelopes, but had achieved the same effect by first wrapping the object in opaque white paper rather loosely; this also obliterated any hard edges that might have given sensory clues. Seth however discounts any possible data obtained through fingering, etc.</td><td>(巧合的是，唐把物件密封在一个信封内，那个信封与我用于实验的那些信封尺寸相同。他没有使用双层信封，但是先把物件相当宽松地包在不透明的白纸内，而达到相同的效果；这也是消除掉可能任何泄漏既定感官线索的硬边。但是对于经由手指触摸得到的任何可能资料，赛斯都会打个折扣。</td></tr><tr><td>(Ann Diebler also witnessed the session, for a total of three witnesses. The three have heard Seth speak before on a few informal occasions; this was their first regular session. All have read some of the material.</td><td>(安·黛伯乐也见证了这一节，所以一共有3个见证人。这3人之前在几次非正式场合听过赛斯讲话；这是他们的第一节定期课。所有人都读过一些资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(It was a hot, muggy night, and windows were open. The night seemed especially noisy, and Jane began speaking from the first in a heavier voice.

There were some questions however that you had in mind, and I shall endeavor to answer them.</td><td>今晚我们主要关注的是我们一直在讨论的资料。但是，你心里要是有一些问题，我会努力回答它们。</td></tr><tr><td>I am particularly concerned, you see, with this matter of projection, simply because your own abilities will rather swiftly lead you along in that direction. Therefore whatever information I can give you will be of great practical benefit. I do not want either of you traveling about unless you know what you are doing.</td><td>我们特别关注的是，你看，投射这件事，只是因为你们自己的能力会很快引导你们走向那个方向。因此，只要是我能够给你们的资讯，都会带来很大的实际助益。除非你知道自己在做什么，否则我不希望你两个四处(出体)旅行。</td></tr><tr><td>Specifically I wanted to mention the matter of subconscious fabrications. Now. Initially particularly, you will meet with these; you must remember that you are wandering in completely different dimensions, and the rules with which you are familiar simply do not apply there.</td><td>具体来说，我想提一下潜意识虚构物这个主题。现在。尤其是一开始，你会遇到这些；你一定要记住，你是在一个完全不同的维度漫游，而你熟悉的规则在那里根本不适用。</td></tr><tr><td>Joseph, I leave it up to you to slow me down when necessary.</td><td>约瑟，我让你决定，必要时让我慢下来。</td></tr><tr><td>(“It's okay so far.” Jane was speaking quite rapidly.)</td><td>(“到当前为止还可以。”珍说得很快。)</td></tr><tr><td>You are familiar, all of you, with subconscious fabrications as they exist in the nightmare condition. Now on occasion when you are projecting from a dream point, you will meet such subconscious images. Your ordinary standards of reality mean absolutely nothing when you leave the physical system, therefore you will encounter, simultaneously perhaps, images that are subconsciously formed; quite valid images that belong in another dimension; constructions created by others within another system; and for any control at all, you must learn how to distinguish one from the other.</td><td>你们所有人都熟悉潜意识的虚构物，因为它们存在噩梦的状况下。现在，当你从一个梦中地点投射时，你会遇到这样的潜意识意象。当你离开物质系统时，你们平常的实相标准一点意义也没有。因此你可能会同时遇到在潜意识里形成的意象；属于另一个维度但颇为有效的意象；在其他系统之内由其他人创造的建构；而且为了能有一点控制，你必须学会区分这两者。</td></tr><tr><td>(Smile, eyes closed.) You see, even I can tell that our guests are not subconscious fabrications, and I would be pleased indeed if they granted me the same privilege. You will have control, you see, over your own subconscious images if you recognize them as your own constructions.</td><td>(微笑，闭着眼睛)你看，连我都能够分辨我们的客人不是潜意识的虚构物，而他们要是也给我同样的特权，我会很高兴。如果你认出它们是你自己的建构，你知道，你就能够控制你自己的潜意识意象。</td></tr><tr><td>Without such recognition however an encounter could be unpleasant. You have little control, and I am speaking here now all evening, of projections and their circumstances—you will have little control over the constructions of others. If, for example, during projection travel you encounter a disturbing image, you must first will it to disappear. If it is a subconscious fabrication it will vanish, but if you do not will it to vanish it will remain, and then you must deal with it as a reality.</td><td>然而，如果没有这样的认识，就可能会是一场令人不愉快的邂逅。你几乎一点控制力都没有，而我现在整个晚上在这里讲的是投射和它们的状况——你对别人的建构几乎一点控制力都没有。比方说，如果你在投射旅行期间遇到一个令人不安的意象，你首先一定要用意志使它消失。如果它是潜意识的虚构物，这就会消失，但如果你不用意志使它消失，它就会留下来，然后你就得把它当作实相来处理。</td></tr><tr><td>In somewhat the same manner, a nightmare will run its course and lead you into terror unless you realize that the nightmare is self-created. In which instance it will disappear.</td><td>以略微相同的方式，噩梦会继续发展而把你带进恐怖之中，除非你发觉噩梦是自行创造的。在这种情况下，它就会消失。</td></tr><tr><td>I cannot emphasize too strongly however the fact that the ordinary standards by which you judge reality will not here apply. And Joseph, you must learn the new rules. Our small friend in the corner (Jane pointed to Ann Diebler) must learn the new rules. Now. Every image that you meet, and every experience, will be varied within its own framework. And do not forget that the experiences which you encounter will have an effect upon your own personality, as vivid or more vivid than the effect of any waking experience.</td><td>无论如何，你据以判断实相的一般标准在这里不适用，我再怎么强调这一点都不为过。约瑟，你必须学习新的规则。我们角落里的小朋友(珍指着安·黛伯乐)必须学习新的规则。现在。你遇到的每一个意象，以及每一次经验，在它自己的架构之内都各有不同。而且不要忘记，你遭遇到的经验对你自己的人格会产生影响，和任何醒时经验的影响一样强烈，或比它们更为强烈。</td></tr><tr><td>We have explored the various forms in which you may travel. I have also told you that the form in which you find yourself can be a tip-off to you. If your levitation experience seems to carry you outside of your solar system, then you know that you are using the third form, and that your abilities for the time are almost limitless, comparatively speaking. Any image that you see in any case must be accepted. Now. Physically speaking it does no good to call such images hallucinations, for they are no more hallucinations than the chair in which my friend Ruburt now sits.</td><td>我们探索了你可以用来旅行的各种形式。我也告诉过你，你发现自己所在的形式对你可能是一个提示。如果你的漂浮经验似乎把你带到你们的太阳系之外，那么你知道你在使用的是第三种形式，而且相对来说，你当时的能力几乎是没有限制的。在任何情况下看到的任何意象，你都必须接受。现在。从物质上来讲，称这样的意象为幻觉，是没有好处的。因为它们并不比我的朋友鲁柏现在坐的这张椅子显得更是幻觉。</td></tr><tr><td>(Eyes open, smiling, very emphatic with gestures.) Ruburt told one of your friends to respect physical reality. Whether or not the automobile is a sensory hallucination, it can kill you, he said. And I tell you, whether or not these images are hallucinations, they can be dangerous, and you must respect the reality in which they exist.</td><td>(睁着眼睛，微笑着，手势非常用力强调。)鲁柏告诉你们的一个朋友要尊重物质实相。他说，无论汽车是不是一个感官幻觉，它都可能杀死你。而我告诉你，无论这些意象是不是幻觉，它们都可能是危险的，你必须尊重它们存在其中的实相。</td></tr><tr><td>(To me:) Is your hand tired?</td><td>(对我)你的手累了吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(“No.")</td><td>(“不累。”)</td></tr><tr><td>Then, I want to be sure that you realize that some of these constructions that you will encounter will belong to another system. They will not be your own constructions. You are safe as long as you do not meddle. You may explore, and freely, and that is all.</td><td>然后，我想确定你明白你将会遇到的一些建构属于另一个系统。它们不是你自己的建构。只要你不插手，你就安全。你可以自由探索，就这样而已。</td></tr><tr><td>We are going to take a very simple example here, an imaginary projection, and explain the steps as they will happen, more or less.</td><td>我们在这里要举一个非常简单的例子，一个想像的投射，解释或多或少会发生的步骤。</td></tr><tr><td>(A loud knock came on the hall door, but Jane continued.)</td><td>(走廊的门传来一声巨响，但珍继续说。)</td></tr><tr><td>First however, before we begin this I will let you take your first break.</td><td>不过首先，在我们开始之前，我会让你先有每一次的休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:22. The knocking came again, loudly. I did not notice, being busy writing, but Don Wilbur said the first knock really jolted Jane out of her trance, or at least the deeper stages of it, even though she continued speaking. Later Jane told me she had been very well dissociated. Her pace was fast, her eyes opened often, and she had used many gestures and much emphasis.</td><td>(9:22休息。敲门声再度响起，很大声。正在忙着写笔记，所以我没有注意到，但唐·韦伯说第一次的敲门声真的让珍脱离她的出神状态，或至少在脱离了比较深层的阶段，即使她继续说话。后来，珍告诉我，她完全出离。她的速度很快，眼睛常常睁开，而且比了很多手势，也多所强调。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane later said the interruption had been a shock to her. She was surprised, since interruptions have not bothered her the last few months.</td><td>(珍后来说这个干扰吓了她一跳。她很惊讶，因为过去几个月来，干扰一点都没有打搅她。</td></tr><tr><td>(Our visitors did not know of the sessions. If they had noticed the rather strong Seth voice through the door--it was quite audible, we were sure—they gave no sign. The visitors left at 10:04. We had used the intervening time as a break, and Jane resumed in the same active manner at 10:05.)</td><td>(我们的访客不知道这些课。如果他们注意到门后赛斯那相当有力的声音——我们确定，它听起来很清楚——他们倒是没有露出任何迹象。访客在10:04离开。我们利用这段时间休息，珍在10:05以同样活泼的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. We will say that you are attempting a projection from a light trance state. Much of what you have read in your Mr. Fox’s book is quite legitimate.</td><td>现在。我们会说你正试图从轻度出神状态投射。你在福克斯先生的书中读到的内容大部分都是合理的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Astral Projection, by Oliver Fox. University Books.)</td><td>(《灵体投射》，奥利弗·福克斯著。大学图书。)</td></tr><tr><td>Some of the effects however, of which he speaks, are the result of his own psychological makeup. You can avoid the unpleasant sensations that he has described if you realize this.</td><td>然而，他所说的一些效应是他自己心理状态造成的结果。如果你明白这一点，你就可以避免他描述的种种不愉快感觉。</td></tr><tr><td>(We had discussed this at supper time. Jane had noticed a close similarity in some of the effects described by Oliver Fox, and those she had experienced on her own while doing psychological time, as long as two years ago.)</td><td>(我们在晚餐时已经讨论这件事。珍注意到奥利弗·福克斯描述的一些效应与她早在两年前于心理时间经历过的一些效应非常相似。)</td></tr><tr><td>Otherwise, you see, you will expect them, and they will happen for that reason. The method that he gave is quite sufficient as far as the initial stages are concerned. However there is much more involved, in what he calls the pineal doorway projection.</td><td>不然的话，你看，你会预期它们，它们就会因为这个原因而发生。就初始阶段而言，他提供的方法相当够用。但是，他所谓的松果体入口(pineal doorway)投射还涉及到很多东西。</td></tr><tr><td>These are my instructions. You may consider this your first lesson. We will go by easy stages, for we do not want you betwixt and between. You may induce a medium trance in whatever way you choose. On occasion this will be spontaneous, as you know. For best results in the beginning it is good to make a projection attempt when you already feel physically drowsy, but pleasantly so. When you have induced the trance state, then begin to examine your own subjective feelings until you find recognition of the inner self.</td><td>我要教你的就是这些。你可以认为这是你的第一堂课。我们会按照简单的阶段来进行，因为我们不希望你不上不下的。你可以用任何你选择的方式诱发中度出神状态。你知道，有时这是自发的。为了一开始就有最佳效果，在你已经感觉昏昏欲睡但心情愉快时，尝试投射是很好的。当你诱发出神状态之后，就要开始检视你自己的主观感受，直到你发现内我的认可为止。</td></tr><tr><td>This involves a recognition of yourself as distinct from the fleshy fibers in which you reside. Then begin to imagine this inner self rising upward. You should experience even at this point an internal sense of motion. This motion may be from side to side, as you gently shake yourself loose, so to speak.</td><td>这意味着认识你自己有别于你所居住的肉体纤维。然后开始想像这个内我向上升起。即使在这一点上，你也应该经验到一种内在的移动之感。这种移动可能是从一侧到另一侧，可以说，在你轻轻摇晃自己到松脱之时。</td></tr><tr><td>It may be a rushing upward. Whichever motion you experience there will be a moment where you feel yourself, your identity and consciousness, definitely withdrawing from the physical organism. Before you attempt the projection, however, the suggestion should be given that the physical organism will be well protected and comfortable. Now when you feel the consciousness withdrawing, there are two things you may do. I suggest the first step I shall give you in preference to the second.</td><td>它可能是急剧上升。无论你经验什么样的移动，都会有你感受到你自己、你的本体和意识，确实从物质有机体撤出的一刻。不过，在你尝试投射之前，应该要暗示物质有机体将会得到充分的保护也会很舒适。现在当你感到意识撤出时，有两件事你可以做。我建议我先给你第一步而不是第二步。</td></tr><tr><td>The first step is this. Forget the physical body, or what you are to do with it. Will yourself out in a quick motion. There is no need to experience the voice hallucinations mentioned by the author, Fox. If the projection is a success you will instantly lose contact consciously with the physical body. You simply will not be in it.</td><td>第一步是这个。忘记身体，或你要用它来做什么。用意志使你自己快速移动。没有必要经历作者福克斯提到的幻听。如果投射成功，你就会立刻在意识上失去与身体的联系。你根本就不在其中。</td></tr><tr><td>Now your consciousness will not be in it, but it is hardly lifeless. Its maintenance is being controlled by the consciousness of the individual cells and organs of which we have spoken. I will give you alternate methods of projecting, but I will be concerned now with what you can expect the few moments after you have left the physical body.</td><td>现在你的意识不在身体之中，但它根本不是没有生命的。它的维持是在我们说过的个别细胞和器官意识控制之下。我会给你另外的投射方法，但现在我要关注的是，在你离开身体之后那些片刻，你可以预期的是什么。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, I am going to give you a short break to rid ourselves of the pussies.

If in your projection you seem to be flying past treetops, then you are indeed doing so.

In our earliest sessions I emphasized that the intensity regulated the duration of an experience. Now, many events that were only imagined and never took place, physically speaking, many such events still exist. They are simply not a part of your definition of reality. You may therefore visit a museum which was planned in the 16th century, but never built. Such a museum has a reality as real, you see, as the house in which you live. Ordinarily you only perceive physical reality. In projections you may visit other realities such as these also—which you may be tempted to call imaginary, but they are not.</td><td>现在，我已经告诉过你，你不仅可以确实探访存在过或以物质的角度来说将会存在的过去、现在和未来，还可以探访以物质的角度来说从未存在的实相。在我们最早的课中，我强调过，强度调节了经验的持续时间。现在，从物质上来讲，很多只是想像过而从未发生过的事件，很多这样的事件仍然存在。它们根本不属于你们对实相的定义。因此，你可以参观一间16世纪规划过但从未建成的博物馆。你知道，这样的一间博物馆有一个和你住的房子一样真实的实相。通常你只会感知物质实相。在投射中，你可能也会探访其他像这些一样的实相——你可能很想说它是想像，但事实并非如此。</td></tr><tr><td>A study of any up-to-date scientific thesis on the nature of sensual perception in general will show you that sense data exists independent of the perceiver, yet not necessarily in physical terms.</td><td>研究一下任何以最新感官知觉的整体本质为主题的科学论文，你就会看到感官资料的存在不受感知者左右，但这不一定是从物质的角度来说。</td></tr><tr><td>Such information, incidentally, is basic if the last points are to make any sense to you at all. At any time in a projection you may will yourself to return, and you shall.</td><td>顺便提一下，如果最后几点对你有任何意义的话，这样的资讯是基本的。在投射中的任何时候，你有意愿回来，就可以回来，而且你回得来。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I have been speaking of projection from a trance state. You may of course project from a dream, and not realize that you have done so. Upon awakening you may then be frightened to find the physical body in what amounts to a trance state, while the mind is wide awake. As I believe Ruburt told our small friend, such has been the case on rather frequent occasions with her. (Jane, her eyes open, pointed at Ann Diebler.)</td><td>现在我一直在谈论出神状态中的投射。你当然可以在梦中投射，而没有发觉你已经这样做了。在醒来之后，发现肉体等于处在出神状态，同时心智却完全清晰，你可能会害怕。就像我相信鲁柏告诉过我们的小朋友那样，她经常出现这种情况。(珍，睁着眼睛，指着安·黛伯乐。)</td></tr><tr><td>Projection from a dream state is something else again, therefore, and when it is executed successfully then you have a fine example of the self as it changes the focus of its own awareness. Here the critical consciousness is quite apparent, while the body sleeps. Projections occur quite naturally under these conditions. For the development of the whole self however, and for the perfection of such experiences, it is beneficial that such projections be carried out by the conscious wish of the projector. You learn therefore to manipulate your own consciousness in different realities than the ones with which you are usually concerned.</td><td>因此，在梦状态中的投射也是另一回事，当它成功执行时，你就有一个好例子，知道自己如何改变它的觉知焦点。这里，批判意识(critical consciousness)颇为明显，而身体却在睡觉。在这些状况下，投射相当自然而然发生。然而，为了全我的发展，以及这种经验的完善，透过投射者有意识的愿望来完成这样的投射是有益的。因此，你学会在不同的实相而不是你平常关注的那些实相当中，操纵你自己的意识。</td></tr><tr><td>There are strange benefits that can result. Some cases are on record where individuals are suddenly propelled out of the path of danger. This involves instantaneous projection. The fear and panic that could make the body vulnerable is not present, and the body escapes danger precisely because consciousness is not there to cause panic reactions.</td><td>可能会因此产生奇怪的好处。有些案例记载个人突然被推出险路之外。这涉及瞬间投射。可能使身体容易受到伤害的恐惧和恐慌不存在，身体逃脱危险，正是因为意识不在那里引起恐慌反应。</td></tr><tr><td>More generally however, and quite simply, such projections allow you to practice in dealing with realities that you will meet when you no longer operate within the physical system. The conditions then will not frighten you, for you will be familiar with them.</td><td>然而，更笼统也相当简单地说，这样的投射容许你练习和你将会遇到的实相打交道，它们是当你不再于物质系统之内运作时，你就会遇到的实相。届时那些状况不会吓到你，因为你熟悉它们。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I am prepared, my dear Joseph, to carry on the session as long as you wish. You have inconveniences of time and so forth.</td><td>我亲爱的约瑟，现在我准备好了，只要你愿意，就可以继续这一节。你有时间或其他方面的不便。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Well I'm afraid it’s getting late. How were our interpretations of the envelope data?”)</td><td>(“嗯，恐怕时间越来越晚了。我们做的信封资料解读怎么样？)</td></tr><tr><td>We will then continue with this at our next session.

Jane hadn’t seen the tag since. See the tracing on page 217. The tag is printed on typical card-weight stock in two colors, red and black as indicated. The face of the tag is gold coated, the string red. The object was sealed in the usual double envelopes, between the usual two pieces of Bristol. The results of the experiment were quite unusual, and Seth goes into the mechanisms involved.</td><td>(第59次信封实验用作物件的一个标签，附在我们于1962年10月购买的来福枪上面。珍没有见过标签。见上面的描摹图。标签印制在重量如卡片的典型纸张上，如图所示，有两种颜色，红色和黑色。标签的表面有金色涂层，吊绳为红色。物件夹在两块普通纸板之间，密封在一般的双层信封内。实验结果相当不寻常，赛斯详细说明相关的机制。</td></tr><tr><td>(A very heavy rain and hailstorm developed at 8:30 this evening.

Bear with me, for some new background material is necessary here. All physical matter exists first as an idea or mental image. The idea of mental image has its own reality, and is charged with energy, and this energy can never be withdrawn. You only accept data when it appears within the physical camouflage system. As you know this severely limits your conception of the real.</td><td>现在。耐心听我讲，因为这里需要一些新的背景资料。所有实体物质首先以一个意念或心象的形式存在。心象的概念有它自身的实相，而且充满能量，这股能量永远不会被撤回。你只接受在物质伪装系统之内出现的资料。你知道，这严重限制了你对真实的概念。</td></tr><tr><td>We are making some simplified statements here to make the idea clear. Data, valid data, which is not materialized as physical form, at any given time still exists as potential physical form. Some such data will be materialized in your future, as for example plans existing only in the mind will later be carried out and utilized within physical form.</td><td>我们在这里做一些简化的表述，以便让你明了这个观念。没有具体化为物质形式的资料，有效的资料，在任何既定的时间，仍然以潜在的物质形式存在。有一些这样的资料将会在你的未来具体化现，例如，只存在心智里的计划，稍后将在物质形式之内被执行和利用。</td></tr><tr><td>Some such data will never be utilized. Some such data will be utilized time and time again. Now you see the energy does not reside within any given physical object, but in the idea form that is within it. Physical objects do not exist as such in a basic manner. You can only perceive large areas of reality data however by transforming it into terms that can be picked up by the physical senses.</td><td>有一些这样的资料永远不会被利用。有一些这样的资料将会被一次又一次利用。现在你看能量并不存在于任何既定的有形物体之内，而是存在于它之内的意念形式中。有形物体基本上并不是以这样的方式存在。无论如何，你只能把它转换成肉体感官能够接收的条件，才能感知大范围的实相资料。</td></tr><tr><td>As you know, you create or construct all physical matter. What you see are your own constructions. This does not mean however that there is not something within or behind what you perceive. All thoughts are composed of energy, and from our discussions you realize that there are electrical intensities within whose range all reality exists.</td><td>你知道，你创造或建构所有的实体物质。你看到的是你自己的建构。然而，这并不是说在你感知的东西之内或背后什么也没有。所有的思想都是由能量构成的，从我们的讨论中，你明白电力强度的存在，所有的实相都存在它们的范围之内。</td></tr><tr><td>Every thought therefore has this kind of reality, which is the only reality, basically speaking. (Long pause.) Sense data itself has a reality independent of any given object. This sense data has its own intensity. If you can tune into that intensity, so to speak, you will automatically translate it into physical data, and you will perceive a physical object.</td><td>因此，每一个思想都有这种实相，基本上来说，这是唯一的实相。(长时间停顿)感官资料本身有一个独立于任何既定物体之外的实相。这个感官资料有它自身的强度。可以说，如果你可以调整到这个强度，你就会自动把它转译成物质资料，你也会感知一个物体。</td></tr><tr><td>If you tune into that intensity imperfectly, you will have a pseudo physical object, that is in one or more respects different from a normal object. It may be obvious for example to some of your physical senses, and not to others. It may be only partially materialized.</td><td>如果你没有完全调整到那个强度，你就会有一个伪物体，它在一个或更多方面与正常物体不同。例如，对你的一些肉体感官来说，它可能是显而易见的，对其他感官来说则不是。它可能只有一部分具体化现。</td></tr><tr><td>In such cases however definite atoms and molecules are utilized. Now. In our seance we were, again, manipulating energy and forming objects from it—objects that you could perceive with your physical senses. The whole matter, if you will forgive my pun (smile) on matter is highly intriguing, and we shall have several sessions at least, dealing with the reality of sense data, and the unreality, comparatively speaking, of matter itself.</td><td>在这样的情况下，利用的是确定的原子和分子。现在。在我们的降神会，我们再次操纵能量并从中形成物体——你可以用肉体感官感知的物体。整件事(whole matter)，原谅我用物质(matter)的双关语(微笑)，是非常有趣的，我们至少会有几节，用来处理感官资料的实相，以及相对来说，物质本身的非实相。</td></tr><tr><td>The whole discussion will be leading us to an investigation of the similarities and differences between such data as dream objects, hallucinated objects, and physical objects.</td><td>整个讨论将会引导我们去调查，在梦中物体、幻觉物体和实质物体这样的资料之间的异同。</td></tr><tr><td>Now you may take your break.</td><td>现在你可以休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:26. Jane was dissociated as usual. Her slow initial pace bad picked up, her eyes had begun to open frequently, and she had sipped iced tea and smoked a cigarette.

In the experimental seance, due to the circumstances and lack of training on Ruburt’s part, we redistributed some energy. Ruburt, during the seance, weighed somewhat less than his usual weight. Very little actually. With his help certain portions of energy were used to construct pseudoimages.</td><td>现在。在这场实验性质的降神会，由于情势使然，加上鲁柏缺乏训练，所以我们重新分配了一些能量。在降神会期间，鲁柏的体重比他平常的体重稍微少了一点。实际上是微乎其微。在他的帮助下，某些部分的能量被用来建构伪意象。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, these images are as real as any physical matter is. (Long pause.) Now once energy is formed into any kind of a pattern, the identity of the pattern is maintained. If it will help you, think in terms of a memory image. Except you see that in many cases the object may never have existed in physical reality.</td><td>再一次，这些意象和任何实体物质一样真实。(长时间停顿)现在，一旦能量形成任何一种模式，模式的本体就会留存。如果对你有帮助的话，就把它想成一个记忆影像。只是你看在很多情况下，物体可能从来不曾存在物质实相中。</td></tr><tr><td>What you perceive with your physical senses is of course real. It is one of the forms that reality takes. But if you insist upon believing that only physical data is real, then you see you will never learn what is within it.</td><td>你用肉体感官感知的事物当然是真实的。它是实相采用的形式之一。但是，如果你坚信只有物质资料是真实的，那么你看你就永远不会知道它之内是什么。</td></tr><tr><td>Reality changes its form in order to become known to itself. It constructs varieties of consciousness with varying kinds of sense apparatus, or perceiving apparatus. Each consciousness then perceives reality in a different fashion. Yet all fashions you see are legitimate, as far as physical sense apparatus is concerned. But the mental or psychic energy behind all this is the one basic reality.</td><td>实相改变其形式，以便为它自己所知。它用各种感觉装置或感知器官建构各种各样的意识。然后每个意识以不同的方式感知实相。不过，就肉体感觉装置而言，你看，所有的方式都是合理的。但这一切背后的心智或心灵能量是唯一的基本实相。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's pace was now fast and energetic, and she used many gestures. Her eyes were very dark, and open wide for paragraphs at a time. She was smoking again.)</td><td>(珍的速度现在很快，能量充沛，她比了很多手势。她的眼睛颜色非常深，睁开一次持续好几个段落。她再次抽烟。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now you can translate inner data into the terms of the outer senses, but always some distortion is absolutely necessary, for the very method of perception you see colors that which is perceived.</td><td>现在你可以把内在资料翻译成外在感官的说法，但有一些扭曲向来是绝对必要的，因为你看，正是感知方法渲染了被感知的事物。</td></tr><tr><td>The objects that you will see and the places that you will visit, in dream or out-of-body experiences, are basically as real as any physical object or location, because neither are basically real. Nor of course are they unreal. As soon as you begin to translate an idea you are distorting it. The inner senses you see do not distort the data, but when you attempt to make such data available to the ego, then distortion to some extent must enter in.</td><td>在梦中或出体经验中，你将看到的物体以及你将拜访的地方基本上和任何实质物体或地点一样真实，因为两者基本上都不是真实的。它们当然也不是不真实。一旦你开始转译一个意念，你就在扭曲它了。你看，内在感官不会扭曲资料，但是当你试图让自我能够得到这样的资料时，一定程度的扭曲就会进入其中。</td></tr><tr><td>The images seen during the seance were quite as real as anything else in the room. They could have been photographed, if any one of the three of you had held the camera. (Broad smile, eyes dark. Seth refers to three here because Bill Macdonnel was a witness to the session.)</td><td>在降神会期间看到的意象和房间里的任何其他东西一样都相当真实。如果你们三个当中的任何一个拿着相机，就有可能把它们拍下来。(笑容满面，眼睛颜色很深。赛斯这里说三个人，是因为比尔•麦唐纳是这一节的见证人。)</td></tr><tr><td>I spoke briefly of the form that appeared in the mirror. Now that appearance was something else again, and was somewhat in the nature of the experience you had much later. (See the 219th session.) You see you pick up the idea even with that form, then you attempt to translate that data into physical terms. The attempt is bound to bring distortions, but without the distortions you could not consciously perceive the data. The distortions in all cases form your physical camouflage patterns.</td><td>我简短谈过镜中出现的形式。现在，再一次，那个表象是别的东西，而且性质有点类似你很久以后的经验。(见第219节)你看，即使是用那种形式，你照样接收到这个意念，然后尝试把那个资料转译为物质的说法。这种尝试必然带来扭曲，但如果没有扭曲，你就无法有意识地感知资料。在所有的情况下，你的物质伪装模式都是扭曲形成的。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take a brief break before our Instream material.</td><td>你可以在我们的殷斯翠姆资料之前短暂休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:57.

Jane was out as usual. Her eyes had remained closed through both experiments. Her pace had been fair. Surprisingly enough, her voice hadn't increased in volume to rise above the noise of the storm. Jane now said the storm hadn't bothered her, so this fact may account for it. She evidently heard me without trouble. (See the tracing of the object on page 217, and the notes concerning it on page 218. As usual at break Jane and I went over the data to make what connections we could with the object. Without Seth's help, in some detail after break, we were greatly puzzled by the data. That is, we could speculate on the reasons for what seemed to be many distortions, but had little idea of the causes. Since we could pick out a few items in the data that seemed to apply to the object, we took it that Seth had correctly tuned in on the object itself and that Jane's translation of the data had been distorted most of the time. For this reason, immediately below will be listed only those parts of the data we think apply. The rest is cleared up by Seth after break. Actually we found the experiment most interesting, and unique in the series so far.</td><td>(10:27休息。珍像往常一样出去了。在两次实验中，她的眼睛始终闭着。她的速度一直很好。令人惊讶的是，她的音调并没有提高，以便盖过暴风雨的噪音。珍现在说暴风雨没有打扰到她，所以这个事实可能就是原因。她显然没有听不见我说话的问题。(见前面的物件描摹图以及相关注释。像往常一样，珍和我在休息时重看一遍资料，以便找出与物件有关的连结。没有赛斯的帮忙，在休息后，详细一看，这个资料让我们觉得非常困惑。也就是说，我们可以推测出看似很多扭曲的理由，但对于起因却毫无概念。由于我们可以在资料中挑选出似乎适用于该物件的几个项目，因此我们认为赛斯已经正确对准物件本身，珍的资料转译大部分时候却是扭曲的。出于这个原因，下面只列出资料中我们认为适用的那些部分。赛斯在休息后把其余资料理清了。实际上我们发现这个资料非常有趣，是目前为止一系列实验中独一无二的一次。</td></tr><tr><td>(Clues were available however. As soon as she opened the double envelope and saw the front of the object, Jane announced that the picture thereon was of a moose. Actually it is a black line drawing, in some detail, of an eagle. We pursued this impasse for some little time. Jane insisted the drawing represented a moose; she interpreted the spread of the eagle's wings as stylized antlers. My tracing is quickly done on page 217, and shows little detail, but the drawing on the actual object is very well and finely done, including individual feathers on the wings, etc. I could see little relationship between an eagle and a moose here except in the most abstract sense. It was easy for us to agree that Jane saw a moose instead of an eagle because she wanted to. Intellectually she agreed that the drawing was of an eagle, but said that she saw a moose.</td><td>(然而，线索是看得到的。她一打开双层信封，看到物件的正面时，珍就宣布上面的图片是一只麋鹿。实际上，这是一只老鹰的黑色线条图。我们继续追查这个僵局一小段时间。珍坚持说这幅画描写的是一只麋鹿；她把鹰翼的展开转译成非写实的鹿角。前面的描摹图，我很快就画完，显示的细节很少，但实际物件上的图画得非常精细，包括翅膀上一根根的羽毛等等。这里我可以看到老鹰与麋鹿之间没有太大关系，除了最抽象的意义以外。我们很容易就同意，因为珍想要，所以她看到一只麋鹿而不是一只老鹰。从理智上来讲，她同意这幅画是一只老鹰，但她说她看到了一只麋鹿。</td></tr><tr><td>(As I began typing these notes on Saturday June 11, two days later, I showed Jane the envelope object again. Her opinion on the drawing had not changed; she still regarded the drawing as that of a moose, with the eagle's wings representing stylized antlers. As for the rest of the drawing other than the wings or antlers, she said she couldn't see anything in it “in particular" that represented an eagle.</td><td>(两天后，6月11日星期六，我开始为这些笔记打字，当时我再次给珍看了信封物件。她对这幅画的看法没有改变；她还是认为这是一只麋鹿的画，老鹰的翅膀代表非写实的鹿角。</td></tr><tr><td>(As soon as she saw the object and identified the eagle as a moose, Jane said the M and “munch” data, given first, applied to the moose idea.</td><td>(她一看到这个物件，并且认为老鹰是麋鹿时，珍说最先给出的M和“大声咀嚼”(munch)资料适用于麋鹿这个概念。</td></tr><tr><td>(Below are a few points that apply to the object itself. Seth concurs that a few such items did come through the general distortions.</td><td>(以下几点适用于物件本身。赛斯同意这些项目有几条确实来自一般的扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The impression of an empty area, perhaps with a border.

In any case these two objects seem to be together, toward the lower center of the object perhaps, holding the object this way. " These are excerpts from succeeding impressions as a group, and are given here because Jane thinks the bending over idea here derived from the way the wings of the eagle bend in and down toward each other; they are together, or close, at the base, and in the center of the object.</td><td>(“两个人的印象。一个人弯腰或俯身……现在，这些可能是物件或画像，而不是人，但我有两个人的印象，以及他们都是女性的印象。不管怎样，这两个物件似乎都在一起，也许朝向下方正中央，以这种方式握住物件。”这些摘录自随后的一组印象，之所以在这里提出来，是因为珍认为这里的弯腰概念来自于老鹰的翅膀两相向内和向下弯曲的方式；它们在物件的底部和正中央是在一起或靠近的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane held the envelope with the long dimension horizontal, but we do not know the position of the object inside them at that time.

It is a possibility, since the pot as well as the plant came from the apartment, and one of Jane's pet activities is decorating the plant containers with various materials and in various ways.</td><td>(我们不知道办公室秋海棠的花盆有没有用布料包裹过。这是一种可能性，因为花盆和植物都来自公寓，珍钟爱的活动之一就是用不同材料和不同方式装饰植物的容器。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Twelve of a kind connected here.” We don't know. We speculated, again, that the double six in the date on the object can add up to twelve.</td><td>(“这里和某种12有关联。”我们不知道。我们再次推测，物件上的日期里有两个6，可以加起来变成12。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A salary or payment connection. "As I sit at my drawing board at the office, perhaps a foot or eighteen inches from the begonia plant which served as a model for the envelope object, I am given my paycheck each Friday afternoon.</td><td>(“和薪水或支付的款项有关联。”当我坐在办公室的绘图板前，距离当作信封物件的模特儿，秋海棠，也许一英尺或18英寸处时，每周五下午我都会收到薪水支票。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Five in a circle. "My sixth question concerns this data, and our interpretation is given there.</td><td>(“在一个圆圈里的5。”我的第六个问题和这个资料有关，我们的解读就在那里。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The impression of splendid, something splendid.” It is no stretching of the truth to say that the office begonia plant is quite a splendid one.</td><td>(“灿烂的印象，某个灿烂的东西。”说办公室里的秋海棠是一棵颇为灿烂的植物，一点都不是言过其实。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A distant connection with monolithic.” Our dictionary says monolith, while referring to one of a kind, also can mean one of large size. The object is a drawing of what is called a giant tubular begonia.</td><td>(“与一整块[monolithic]有遥远的关联。”我们的字典说“monolith”，是指唯一一个，同时也可以是一大个的意思。这个物件是所谓巨型管状秋海棠的一幅画。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A group of men.” We believe this to be a valid interpretation: My drawing board at the office, with the begonia beside it, happens to be the first in line of several. Just beyond my board is a very large table that is used to spread out very large printed sheets before they are cut up into individual cards, etc. This table is perhaps three feet away. Around it are clustered groups of men every day, going over the current job on the press. Foremen, printers, directors, artists, etc.</td><td>(“一群男人。”我们认为这是一个有效的解读：我在办公室的绘图板恰好是一排几个当中的第一个，旁边是秋海棠。在我的绘图板那一边是一张非常大的桌子，用来铺开非常大的印刷纸张，之后它们就会被裁切成一张张卡片。这张桌子可能在三英尺外。每天聚集在它周围的是一群群男人，查看印刷厂当前的工作。领班、印刷工、主管、画家等等。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A score.” We don't know.</td><td>(“得分。”我们不知道。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with a meeting at seven, or by seven.” We don't know.

I used a black felt marking pen to make the drawing; this is indelible, and the ink soaked through the porous paper until the drawing is quite easily visible on the reverse side. This cannot be seen on the tracing on page 226.</td><td>(“两面都写了字的一张卡片。”用作物件的画是在一张多孔纸张上完成的，它比大多数纸张厚一些，实际上并不是卡片纸。我使用一支黑色毛毡尖墨水记号笔画这张素描；这是洗不掉的，而且墨水渗透了这张多孔纸，在纸张背面很容易就看得到这幅画。这在前面的描摹图上看不到。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Your initials, Joseph.” I signed and dated the object, using the first initial and last name.</td><td>(“你的名字缩写，约瑟。”我在物件上签名并注明日期，用的是第一个首字母和姓氏。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with another woman. That is, beside Ruburt.” As stated, the office begonia plant grew from a slip taken from a plant here in the apartment. This parent plant was given to Jane by our neighbor on the same floor, Miss Callahan, a retired school teacher in her late 70s.</td><td>(“和另一个女人有关联。也就是说，在鲁柏旁边。”如上所述，办公室秋海棠是从公寓这里的一棵植物剪下的一根插枝。这棵亲本植株是我们住在一层楼的邻居卡拉汉小姐送给珍的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“February or March, " See the second impression on page 230. As said there, we think it quite likely that I took the plant slip to the office last March.</td><td>(“2月或3月。”见前面第二个印象。如上所述，我们认为很可能是3月我把植物带到办公室。</td></tr><tr><td>(“and a grand view.” We are not sure. We offer this: Miss Callahan has a nice view from her apartment windows. She spends much of her day sitting at a window admiring the view, and never fails to mention it when Jane visits her. However she doesn't use the phrase “a grand view. "Jane says Miss Callahan favors the adjective “lovely” instead.</td><td>(“以及一个宏伟的景色。”我们不确定。我们提出这个：卡拉汉小姐从她的公寓窗外可以看到美丽的景色。一天大部分时间，她都坐在一扇欣赏这片风景的窗边，每次珍去探望她一定会提到它。然而，她没有用“一个宏伟的景色”这句话。反之，珍说卡拉波小姐喜欢用“可爱”这个形容词。</td></tr><tr><td>(“ I am not sure. I am thinking in terms of family connections. However the word may have to do instead with, for example, type on a card.” My first question, concerning the lineage data: See page 230. Seth didn’t elaborate very much. There is no type on the object. Can family connections be applied to the descendants of a parent plant?</td><td>(“我不肯定。我想的是家族关系。但是，这个词反而可能和，比方说，卡片上的字体有关联。”我的第一个问题，和血统资料有关；见前面。赛斯没有仔细说明。物件上没有任何字体。家族关系能否适用于亲本植株的后代？</td></tr><tr><td>(The second question asked for colors on the object: “Brown and oval.” This is a repeat of the data given on page 230, which can refer to the office begonia. Jane now continued before I could ask another question:</td><td>(第二个问题是问物件的颜色：“棕色和椭圆形。”这是重复前面给出的资料，可能是指办公室的秋海棠。在我可以提出另一个问题之前，珍此时又继续：</td></tr><tr><td>(“Now, I have the impression that the object is roughly divided into four areas, in this manner, you see, with fairly dark lines. " See the notes with this data on page 230. Jane, while holding the envelope, and the object inside it, horizontally, made a vigorous crossing and vertical motion with an arm. See the tracing on page 226. The drawing shows that the leaves of the plant are climbing up a wooden stick. With the object held horizontally, the stick is also horizontal and divides the drawing in half easily enough; the horizontal attribute of her gesture was stressed by Jane. The fairly dark lines on the object are obvious.</td><td>(“现在，我的印象是，物件粗略分为4个区域，以这种方式，你看，用相当黑的线条。”见前面这个资料的注释。珍横向拿着里面装着物件的信封，同时用一只手臂比了一个有力的交叉与垂直的动作。见前面的描摹图。画作上显示植物的叶子正爬上一根木棍。横向拿着物件时，棍子也是横向的，而且很容易就可以把这张画分成两半；珍强调她的手势是横向的这个特性。物件上相当黑的线条是显而易见的。</td></tr><tr><td>(There is a less clear vertical division to be seen on the object while in the horizontal position, although the brush marks in the upper left corner help to mark off a portion. This would give perhaps three quarters on the object definite enough, and possibly this gave rise to Seth’s statement about rough division into four areas. Jane continues:</td><td>(物件的位置是横向的时候，可以看到一个不太清晰的垂直分割，但是左上角的刷痕有助于画分出其中一部分。这可能会让物件的3/4看起来够明显，也可能是说分为4个区域这番话的起因。珍继续：</td></tr><tr><td>(“The four areas could be different in color, and fairly bright—perhaps also a pale blue. I do not know if this is a symbolic impression or not.” The object itself is in black and white only. We offer a pale blue connection however that we have been aware of for several years. Miss Callahan, who gave Jane the parent begonia which led to the making of the envelope object, is inordinately fond of blue. We do not know if Seth would call this a symbolic connection. Miss Callahan's apartment is largely blue. Her living room has pale blue painted walls, including a floor to ceiling painted blue bookcase. Her divan is covered with solid blue, as is a matching overstaffed chair. The other chair is of a blue printed pattern. The rug is a darkish violet and gray, close to a blue, etc. (“ I believe an older woman.” The third question sought to find out who the other woman was beside Jane. See the woman data on page 230. We think this answer reinforces our interpretations of the woman data, and the symbolic blue data just noted. Miss Callahan of course being considerably older than Jane—about 78, we believe. Again, Miss Callahan gave Jane the parent begonia which furnished eventually the office begonia; a drawing of the office begonia was used as the envelope object for tonight.</td><td>(“这4个区域的颜色可能不同，相当明亮——也许还有一种淡蓝色。我不知道这是不是一个象征性的印象。”物件本身只有黑色和白色。我们提供一个关联是我们已经注意了几年的淡蓝色。卡拉汉小姐把秋海棠亲本植株送给珍，后来才会产生这个信封物件，而她对蓝色的喜爱超乎寻常。我们不知道赛斯会不会称之为象征性的联系。卡拉汉小姐的公寓大部分都是蓝色的。她的客厅有浅蓝色的墙壁，包括一个从地板到天花板的蓝色书柜。她的沙发上覆盖着纯蓝色，还有一把同色系的厚软垫椅子也是。另一把椅子是蓝色印花图案。地毯是深紫色和灰色，接近蓝色等等。(“我相信是一个比较年长的女人。”第三个问题试图找出在珍旁边的另一个女人是谁。见前面的女人资料。我们认为这个答案强化了我们对女人资料以及刚刚提到的蓝色象征性资料所作的解读。卡拉汉小姐当然比珍年长很多——大概78岁，我们相信。再一次，卡拉汉小姐送给珍秋海棠亲本植株，因为它最终有了办公室的秋海棠；办公室秋海棠的画被用作今晚的信封物件。</td></tr><tr><td>(My fourth question asked for the initiale of this older woman. The question made Jane hesitate: “You had better wait on this. The older woman data leads Ruburt to make personal associations which could be distortive. " (Pause.) "We will try here with the initial A, or G. ’’Jane said the question brought her mother to her mind; Seth however did not want to give her mother 's name, which is Marie Roberts, or those initials; and Jane did not do so. But A or G as far as we know do not apply to Miss Callahan either, whose first name is Florence.</td><td>(我的第4个问题是问这个年长女人的姓名缩写。这个问题让珍犹豫不决：“这个你最好等一下。年长女人的资料引导鲁柏做了个人的联想，所以可能是扭曲的。这里我们要试试首字母A或G。”珍说这个问题让她的母亲浮现在她的脑海；但是，赛斯不想给出她母亲的名字，玛丽·罗伯兹[Marie Roberts]，或是姓名缩写；而且珍没有这么做。但据我所知，A或G不适用于卡拉汉小姐，她的名字是芙罗伦斯。</td></tr><tr><td>( I now made a comment: “That word monolithic is interesting.” Seth replied: “This is in connection with a drawing or design. And mono, also meaning one. " 7he envelope object is a drawing. See also the interpretation of monolithic on page 232.</td><td>(此时我发表了一个评论：“一整块[monolithic]这个词很有意思。”赛斯回答说：“这和一幅画或设计有关联，而mono，也有一的意思。”信封物件是一幅画。见前面一整块的解读。</td></tr><tr><td>(The next question was: “How about that five in a circle?’’ “The impression is visual. The circle outlined in yellow, I believe, and I see visually a red five inside." This puzzled us, and we think it contains some sort of distortion as far as the red five is concerned. Part of this data may be valid. As a joke one of my co workers at the office hung a homemade chain from the top of the wooden stick which supports the begonia. The stick is visible in the drawing used as object. I did not of course show the chain in the drawing.</td><td>(接下来的问题是:“那在一个圆圈里的5怎么样？”“这是视觉印象。我相信，这个圆圈用黄色勾勒出来的，在视觉上，我看到里面有一个红色的5。”这让我们苦思不解，我们就红色的5而言，它有某种扭曲。这个资料的一部分可能是有效的。我在办公室的一名同事开了个玩笑，把一条自制的链子挂在支撑秋海棠的木棍顶端。在用作物件的画作中可以看见这根棍子。我当然没有把链子画进去。</td></tr><tr><td>(Checking the day after this experiment, I found that the chain contains five large links, each perhaps two inches in diameter. The chain is made of gold coated stock, that is card stock that is gold on one side. The gold side of the stock is on the outside of the links so that they sparkle when sunlight strikes them. Seth’s mention of a visual impression, and the yellow and circle data, reminded me of the chain. We cannot determine the meaning of the red five data however.</td><td>(隔天核对这个资料，我发现链子也包含5个大链节，每个链节的直径可能是两英寸。链子是由镀金的纸张制成，也就是一面是金色的卡片纸。纸张的金色那一面在链节的外侧，这样阳光一照射，它们就会闪闪发光。赛斯提到的一个视觉印象以及黄色和圆形的资料，让我想起了这条链子。但我们无法确定红色的5这个资料有何含义。</td></tr><tr><td>(We do not know whether the chain interpretation is correct. It would be very interesting, if so, since Jane has never seen the chain, nor as stated even the plant itself since I took it to the office. Nor did she know the paper chain existed; she is quite sure I did not tell her of this, and I have no memory of doing so.</td><td>(我们不知道链子的解读是否正确。如果是的话，那就很有意思了，因为珍从未见过链子，甚至之前说过，打从我把植物带到办公室以来，她也没有见过它本身。她也不知道纸链的存在；她很确定我没有告诉她这件事，我也不记得我有说过。</td></tr><tr><td>(“ I have come as close as I can this evening.” This when I asked Seth to name the object. Jane then added:</td><td>(“我今晚已经尽可能接近了。”当我要求赛斯指出物件时，这是他的回答。然后珍补充说：</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with a framework of some kind. Perhaps wooden”, can refer to the wooden stick which shows in the drawing used as object. The stick supports the begonia plant, and is a framework in this sense.</td><td>(“和某种框架有关联。也许是木制的”可能是指在用作物件的画中显示的木棍。木棍支撑秋海棠，而且就这个意义而言，它是一个框架。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed at 11:07.)</td><td>(珍在11:07继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. I will keep you but briefly, though I could speak for some time.</td><td>现在。我只耽搁你一会儿，虽然我可以说上一段时间。</td></tr><tr><td>In our early test experiences Ruburt would not have been able to let test data come through this clearly, on an evening when you had indulged in a conversation such as you did tonight.</td><td>在我们早期的测试经验中，当你沉浸在今晚这样的交谈时，鲁柏无法让测试资料这么清楚传过来。</td></tr><tr><td>(“ I wondered about that.”)</td><td>(“我怀疑是这样。”)</td></tr><tr><td>Since our time is limited, I have emphasized our material, with our experimental data.</td><td>由于我们的时间有限，我用我们的实验资料来凸显我们的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>We will now then close the session, as I would not now add more to your work load. My heartiest wishes to you both, and to Ruburt, who thinks an eagle is a moose.</td><td>那我们现在要结束这一节了，因为我现在不要增加你的工作量。给你们两位，也给鲁柏，我最衷心的祝福，他认为老鹰是麋鹿。</td></tr><tr><td>("He still does.” See the drawing of the envelope object used in the last session, on page 217. Today Jane told me the eagle still looked like a moose to her.)</td><td>(“她依然这么想。”见上一节信封物件的图。今天，珍告诉我，那只老鹰在她看来还是像麋鹿。)</td></tr><tr><td>This is to be expected.

Jane had been trying to keep alive a young robin that had been caught by one of our cats last Monday. This morning we found the bird had died during the night. It had been kept outside, in a safe place, and fed, etc. Last night at perhaps 10 PM, as we sat in the living room, Jane suddenly announced: “The bird is dead.” But we did not go to check.)</td><td>(见上一节。珍一直尝试要保住一只年幼知更鸟的性命，上周一它被我们的一只猫抓到。今天早上我们发现这只鸟在夜间死了。它被放在外面，在一个安全的地方，也喂食过了等等。昨晚大约10点，我们坐在客厅，珍突然宣布：“乌死了。”但我们没有去查看。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. You recall certainly the material dealing with the inner senses. Experiments and experiences using psychological time, and all projection events, deal rather directly with the use of these inner senses.</td><td>现在。你肯定记得探讨内在感官的资料。使用心理时间的实验和经验，以及所有的投射事件，都和这些内在感官的使用有直接的关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Such experiences as projection will therefore involve you in extremely vivid movement and sensation. You may to some extent, and you should, use your critical faculties when you are projecting. However you cannot emphasize these too strongly or you will terminate the experience.</td><td>因此，像投射这样的经验会让你卷入极为生动的动作和感觉中。在某种程度上，你可能也应该在投射时使用你的批判能力。但是你不可以过度强调这些，否则你会终止这个经验。</td></tr><tr><td>Training will allow you to maintain the proper balance. Usually you do not use all of the inner senses in any given projection experience. Now, for this reason you see certain projections will seem entirely different than others.</td><td>训练会让你保持适当的平衡。在任何既定的投射经验中，通常你不会使用所有的内在感官。现在，由于这个原因，你会发现某些投射似乎和其他的投射截然不同。</td></tr><tr><td>You remember that I listed briefly the three forms that you use during your projections. Now I will also say that in the first form you usually use certain inner senses; in the second form you use more of these, you see, and in the third form you make an attempt to use all of them, though very rarely is this successful. You should find it interesting, when you note waking or dream projections, to notice the overall form of perception that you seem to be using. You will automatically shield yourself in a large measure from stimuli that is too strong for your own rate of development. This balancing attempt may lead to an unevenness of experience during any given projection.</td><td>你记得我简要列出了你在投射时使用的三种形式。现在我还要说，在第一种形式中，你通常会使用某些内在感官；在第二种形式中，你使用更多内在感官，你看，而在第三种形式中，你尝试使用所有内在感官，尽管这样做很少成功。当你注意到醒时或梦中投射时，你会发现，留意你似乎正在使用的整体感知形式，是很有趣的事。你在很大程度上自动避开那些对你自己的发展速度而言太强烈地刺激。这种试图平衡的行动在任何既定投射期间，可能会造成经验的不稳定</td></tr><tr><td>As you know however, it is almost impossible for you to be aware of the full perceptions possible, for the ego would never stand for it. Oftentimes, even in simple dreams, you feel concepts, you understand a particular piece of information, without a word having been spoken.</td><td>然而，如你所知，你几乎不可能觉察到可能性的全部感知，因为自我永远不会容忍它。通常，即使是在简单的梦中，你也会感受到概念，你了解一个特定的讯息，却一个字也没有说出口。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's voice was by now somewhat heavier and stronger.)</td><td>(珍的声音现在比较沉重和有力一点。)</td></tr><tr><td>As you know, this is characteristic of one of our inner senses. In some projection experiences you will also know, or experience a concept, and at first you see you may not understand what is happening. You usually think out an idea. There are some experiences that involve what we shall call pseudo projections.</td><td>如你所知，这是我们内在感官的一个特征。在一些投射经验中，你也会了解或体验一个概念，而在一开始，你看，你可能不了解正在发生的事情。你通常会想出一个主意。有一些经验涉及的是我们可以称之为伪投射的现象。</td></tr><tr><td>In these you experience as actual the innermost reality of a given concept. Now this may, or may not, be a valid projection. There are ways to discover whether the projection is a pseudo one or a valid one. For one simple example, Ruburt experienced a valid projection begun from the dream state, some time ago.</td><td>在这些伪投射当中，你实际体验到一个既定概念内在最深处的实相。现在这可能是也可能不是有效的投射。有方法可以发现投射是一个伪投射，还是一个有效的投射。举一个简单的例子，不久前鲁柏经历过一次从梦状态开始的有效投射。</td></tr><tr><td>Now this was valid. However it is also very similar to an experience in which the individual feels himself inside of a concept.</td><td>现在，这是有效的。但是，它和个人感觉他自己在一个概念之中的经验也非常类似。</td></tr><tr><td>I leave it to you, Joseph, to slow me down when you wish.</td><td>我让你决定，约瑟，你希望我慢下来，我就慢下来。</td></tr><tr><td>(“It's okay.”)</td><td>(“没关系。”)</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt was in the third form, and he did indeed project beyond your solar system. This was still a projection within the physical universe however. He was given information which he did not recall consciously. When you experience clearly (.smile), when you explore the inside of a concept, you act it out. You form a temporary but very vivid image production.</td><td>鲁柏是用第三种形式，他确实投射到你们的太阳系之外。然而，这仍然是在物质宇宙之内的一个投射。他接收到他在意识上想不起来的资讯。当你清清楚楚地体验时(微笑)，当你探索一个概念的内在时，你就会付诸行动。你形成了一个暂时但非常生动的意象产物。</td></tr><tr><td>If the experience of Ruburt’s had merely been this, it still would have been pertinent, for when you understand a concept in such a manner, you never forget it. The knowledge becomes part of your physical cells, and of your own electromagnetic structure.</td><td>如果鲁柏的经验仅仅是这个而已，那它仍然是相关的，因为当你以这样的方式了解一个概念时，你永远不会忘记它。这个知识变成你肉体细胞与你自身电磁结构的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>I want to make this clearer however. Suppose that you suddenly understand the concept of oneness with the universe, and that this particular inner sense of feeling concepts is to be used. You would then construct, as you construct dream images, a multitudinous variety of shapes and forms meant to represent the complicated varieties of life. You would then have the experience of entering into each of these lives. You would not think what it was like to be a bird, you would momentarily be a bird. This does involve a projection of sorts, and yet it still must be called a pseudo projection.</td><td>不过，我想要把这一点讲得更清楚。假设你突然了解宇宙是一体的概念，就要用到感觉概念的这一种内在感官，那么当你建构梦意象时，你就会建构种类繁多的形状和形式。以此代表生命的复杂多样。然后，你会有进入这些生命当中每一个的经验。你不会想着当一只鸟是什么感觉，你会有片刻就是一只鸟，这确实涉及各种投射，但还是必须称之为伪投射。</td></tr><tr><td>A valid projection you see would involve the actual projection of one of your forms, so that it actually did enter these various other forms.</td><td>你看，有效的投射意味着你的一个形式所做的实际投射，因此它实际上真的进入了其他这些各式各样的形式之中。</td></tr><tr><td>Now you may take a break, and we shall continue.</td><td>现在你可以休息一下，我们再继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:23.  Jane was dissociated as usual, she said. Her eyes remained closed. Her voice had become somewhat stronger, her pace good.</td><td>(9:23休息，珍说，她像往常一样出离。她的眼睛一直闭着。她的声音变得比较有力一点，她的速度很好。</td></tr><tr><td>(She resumed in the same energetic manner, although her eyes began to open after a paragraph or two. 9:37.)</td><td>(她以同样能量充沛的方式继续，但是她的眼睛在一两个段落之后开始睁开。9:37分。)</td></tr><tr><td>You see, some experiences will be simple attempts to use the inner senses more fully. You are at a point where you can utilize these to a much larger extent. Some such experiences will appear to be projections, and as we go along I will tell you how to distinguish between them.</td><td>你看，有些经验是更充分使用内在感官的简单尝试。你正处于可以更大程度利用这些内在感官的节骨眼上。有些这样的经验看起来是投射，随着我们的进展，我会告诉你如何区分它们。</td></tr><tr><td>You will be able to look back and see your physical body upon the bed on some occasions, and in other cases you will not be able to do this. The form that you see will allow you to have some idea of your abilities in any given projection. You may begin a projection in one form, and then project from it to another form.</td><td>在某些情况下，你将会有能力回头看，看见你的身体在床上，而在其他情况下，你将无法做到这一点。你看到的形式将会让你对自己在任何既定投射中的能力有一些概念。你可以在一个形式中开始投射，然后从它投射到另一个形式。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you understand?</td><td>你明白吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes.” Jane stared at me, her eyes now open steadily. Her voice was again stronger.)</td><td>(“是的。”珍盯着我看，她的眼睛现在规律地睁开。她的声音再次更加有力。)</td></tr><tr><td>In the first form, you can look back, and see your body. If you project from this form into another in order to intensify your experience, then from this second form you will not see your body upon the bed.</td><td>在第一种形式中，你可以回头看，而看见你的身体。如果你为了增强你的经验，而从这种形式投射到另一种形式，那么从这第二种形式，你就看不到你在床上的身体。</td></tr><tr><td>You will be aware however of your body, and you will experience some duality. In the third form you will no longer be aware that your body is on the bed, and you will not see it.</td><td>然而，你会觉知你的身体，你会体验几分二元性。在第三种形式中，你不再觉知你的身体在床上，你也不会看到它。</td></tr><tr><td>In the third form your experiences will be more vivid. They will involve you perhaps in other systems beside your own, and you will have little contact with your physical form. For this reason projection in the third form is the most difficult to maintain. The possibilities are truly fascinating, but there are dangers that do not exist when the other two forms are used.</td><td>在第三种形式中，你的经验会更加生动。他们会让你专注于你自身系统之外的其他系统，而且你和你的物质形式几乎没有联系。由于这个原因，第三种形式的投射是最难维持的。可能性真的很吸引人，但是也有使用其他两种形式时不存在的危险。</td></tr><tr><td>Your consciousness is far divorced from the physical organism, and it would be dangerous to stay away for any extended period of physical time. It would for example be quite possible to return to the physical body from this form, and not recognize it as your own. We would not want you to have such an experience. There is confusion and disorientation that can occur, using this third form. You need have no worries however, since as a rule your excursions will be along the lines of your own development.</td><td>你的意识远远离开物质有机体，而且离开的物质时间不管多久，只要太长就会有危险。例如，从这种形式返回肉体，而不认得它是你自己的肉体，是有可能的。我们不希望你有这样的经验。使用第三种形式可能会出现困惑和迷失方向的状况。但是，你不需要担心，因为通常你的出游和你自己的发展是一致的。</td></tr><tr><td>Using this third form, there would be a tendency for you not to recognize your own physical situation. It would be difficult to carry the memories of the present ego personality with you. This third form is the vehicle of the inner self. The disorientation that it feels is the disorientation, you see, that it will feel when the physical body is deserted, or at the point of death.</td><td>使用这个第三种形式，你会有个倾向是，不认识自己的物质情况。随身携带当下自我人格的记忆并不容易。第三种形式是内我的载体，它感觉到的迷失方向是，当身体被遗弃或死亡时，它会感觉到的迷失方向。</td></tr><tr><td>The disorientation is only temporary, and when the form is severed from the physical body, then all the memories and identity within the electromagnetic system become part of the inner self, of course.</td><td>迷失方向只是暂时的，当这个形式与肉体分离时，电磁系统之内的所有记忆和本体当然都会变成内我的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>But this is not an instantaneous process, and in any projection attempt there is no need whatsoever for this to be carried any further. This form is used however for purposes of instruction. It is used now and then to acquaint the whole personality with those circumstances that shall at one time affect it.</td><td>但这不是一个瞬间的过程，在任何投射的尝试中，都没有必要带着这个往前走。不过，使用这种形式是为了教学，偶尔用它来让整个人格熟悉那些一度影响它的状况。</td></tr><tr><td>There are occasions, though they are rare, when the disorientation period is completely passed, and connection with the body is therefore nearly broken. We shall not however deal with this situation. Most of your projections will be in the first and second forms.</td><td>虽然很少见，但是有些情况是当迷失方向的时期完全过去了，和身体的连结因此几乎不断。但是，我们不会讨论这种情况。你的投射大多数都会采用第一种和第二种形式。</td></tr><tr><td>Usually you will project from the physical body into the first form, and then perhaps into the second form. Occasionally this will happen and you will not know it, despite all your attempts to ascertain your circumstances. There are indeed however ways and signs that tell you when you switch from one form to the other, and we shall indeed see that you know these. You should both—this is Joseph and Ruburt now—you should both have several examples of projections within the first and second forms in the following months, if your development continues at its present rate.</td><td>通常，你会从肉体投射到第一种形式，然后也许再投射到第二种形式。偶尔这会发生，而且你不会知道，不管你怎样尝试查明你的处境都没用。不过，会有方法和征象告诉你，你从一种形式转换到另一种形式，我们真的应该看看你知道这些事。你们两个都应该——现在这是指约瑟和鲁柏——你们两个都应该在接下来几个月有几个在第一种和第二种形式之内投射的例子，如果你们的发展照目前的速度继续下去的话。</td></tr><tr><td>I want to mention the difference also in experience and sensation, between a projection that begins in the dream state, and one that begins in a trance state, and also to discuss what Ruburt calls awake-seeming dreams, for there are several points here that you do not know, and they are fairly important.</td><td>我想提一下，始于梦状态的投射和始于出神状态的投射之间，在经验和感觉上的差异，也要讨论鲁柏所谓的看似醒来的梦，因为这里有几点是你不知道的，而且它们相当重要。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a break now for our Instream material.</td><td>我建议现在休息一下，为了我们的殷斯翠姆资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:59.

Livestock and rats.</td><td>也和过去有关，或许是过去治疗这个疾病，或许是历史性的含义。数字175和377，我相信。这些可能是页码，我不知道。或者也可能和13世纪和17世纪有关联。也提到和火灾有关联。牲畜和老鼠。</td></tr><tr><td>A small, very white object also. It seems to be a cube with the side to the right lighter somehow than the other sides. The object may lay on the page of a book.</td><td>一个小型、非常白的物体。看起来像一个立方体，右边那一面比其他几面更轻。物体可能放在书的页面上。</td></tr><tr><td>Other impressions not connected with the object—a letter from a cousin, received by Dr. Instream.

Seth now went into something new as far as the envelope data is concerned. The Wilburs and I agreed later that Seth evidently decided to insert the following material just on his own, and because the time, and Jane's trance state, seemed right to him. There is also a general idea connection with what follows and the envelope object.)</td><td>(我似乎又打断了。就信封而言，赛斯现在又开始说起新的事情。韦伯夫妇和我后来都同意，赛斯显然决定光靠他自己插入以下资料，因为时间以及珍的出神状态对他来说似乎都适合。以下的内容和信封物件也和一个大致的概念有关联。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, we will try something here.

Jane was dissociated very well, she said—really out. She thought Seth had done this deliberately to compensate for the traffic noise coming through our open windows, and because the witnesses had, in the beginning of the data, unwittingly distracted her by moving papers, coughing, etc.</td><td>(10:31休息。珍说，她完全出离——真的出去了。她认为是因为车流噪音从我们打开的窗户传来，所以赛斯为了补偿才刻意这样做，而且因为见证者在资料的开头移动文件、咳嗽等等，而不知不觉分散了她的注意力。</td></tr><tr><td>(As noted on page 242, I asked Jane to hold the envelope in the same position as she came out of trance. Since she leaves the trance state easily and quickly, she heard me and complied. The envelopes and Bristols were then marked as noted, and finally the object itself. This shows as T at the top of page 4, in the copy on page 236. See also the notes on page 242.</td><td>(如前面所述，我要求珍拿着信封的位置与她脱离出神状态的时候一样。由于她轻松又迅速脱离出神状态，所以她听见我也照办了。随后如上述在信封和纸板做了标记，最后也在物件本身做了标记。这就是在前面的副本第四页顶端显示的T。另见前面的注释。</td></tr><tr><td>(The Wilburs, Jane and I made the envelope connections. Seth confirmed our interpretation of a couple of them after break.</td><td>(韦伯夫妇、珍和我为信封找了连结。赛斯在休息后证实我们对其中一两项所做的解读。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Ten.” The object is a notice Jane and I received in the mail recently, stating that a local artists supply store was continuing in business under new management.

We believe he was getting at the construction of the drawing on page I of the object. The three sections of milkweed pod shown are made up groups of lines; each group contains about the same number and arrangement of lines, whether one would consider them black or white. One could find arrangements of five lines in each of these groups, but could also count more or less, depending on approach. We believe the idea of repetition here to be valid.</td><td>(“也许，虽然我不确定，某个东西重复了5次。”赛斯在这里并不确定。我们相信他正处理物件第一页那张图的建构。图上的乳草荚果是由三组线条构成；每一组包含数量和排列方式大致相同的线条，无论你认为它们是黑色或白色的。在这三组线条中，每一组你都可以找到五条线的排列，但也可能因为方法的关系，数量有多有少。我们相信此处这个重复的概念是有效的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with a framework that is broken, or cut off." In the lower right hand corner of page I of the object is a monogram consisting of the letters A and S, for Art Shop. The right leg of the A is cut shorter than the left leg. When Jane saw the monogram she said the A represented a framework to her, like an A-frame house, and that the right leg was shorter.</td><td>(“和一个破掉或切断的构架有关联。”在物件的第一页右下角是由艺术商店[Art Shop]的首字母A和S组成的一个花押字。A的右边被切断而比左边短。珍看到花押字时，她说在她看来，A代表一个框架，像一间A型框架的房子，而且右边更短。</td></tr><tr><td>(The word “framing” appears at the bottom of page 3, and is itself enclosed in a fancy frame, but evidently Seth wasn’t referring to this.</td><td>(“框架”这个词出现在第三页的底部，它本身被包围在一个花式编框内，但显然赛斯指的不是这个。</td></tr><tr><td>(“This is difficult to put into words... The impression of something going forward, as of a path, you see, that is wide, and then narrows into the distance.”Jane made her gesture, as described on page 242. “That may need some interpretation, but that is the impression.” I sought more information on this impression by the first question. At the time of the above data Jane held the envelope horizontally. There can be a literal interpretation: The drawing of the milkweed on page one of the object is V-shaped in the abstract sense—wide at one end, narrowing to a point, as did Jane's gesture. Also the A in the Art Shop monogram narrows somewhat but doesn't come to a point. There can also be a symbolic interpretation, and Seth raises this possibility in answer to the first question.</td><td>(“这很难用言语描述……印象是某个往前进的东西，像一条路那样，你看，先是宽阔的，然后越远越窄。”珍比了她的手势，如前面所述。“这可能需要一些解读，但印象就是这样。”我提出第一个问题，以便找出这个印象的相关资讯。在给出上述资料期间，珍横向握住信封。可能有一个字面上的解读：在物件第一页的乳草图就抽象意义而言是V字形——一端是宽的，缩小到变成一个点，就像珍的手势那样。此外，在艺术商店的花押字当中，A也缩小了一点，但没有变成一个点。还可能有一个象征性的解读，赛斯在回答第一个问题时提出了这种可能性。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane now switched the envelope to a vertical position, and as explained on page 242 I marked the object T for top, as shown in the copy on page 236.

Now, I believe handwriting.” There is no handwriting on the object, only type. In the past Jane, or Seth, has intermixed terms for printed copy, calling it printing, writing, type, etc.</td><td>(“写了一些字。现在，我相信是手写字。”物件上没有手写字，只有印刷字。过去珍或赛斯混用过印刷版本的术语，称之为印刷、书写、印刷字体等等。</td></tr><tr><td>(“And perhaps with an older man.

We don't know whether the following data is in answer to the question: “A designation of some sort. Perhaps initials or date, in the upper left-hand corner, on the other side of the object.”Jane again indicated the upper left corner of the envelope, as she still held it vertically.

Of your family, Joseph.”</td><td>(第三个问题是和物件有关联的颜色。赛斯考虑要回答这个问题，但首先插入关于我弟弟洛伦的资料：“现在，这里我们要来尝试一下某个东西。我高高在上，俯视着一个房间，里面有4个人坐在桌边。他们是一个家庭的成员。你的家人，约瑟。”</td></tr><tr><td>(“ I believe your brother Loren is one present. The number 17, a date in July which will be significant to him, or his close family—not necessarily to him, you see.” We did not ask for this data; it came through spontaneously. We saw one reason why Seth could have chosen to insert it here in the envelope data, and Seth confirms our speculation Later. Our idea was that Seth sought to use the idea of a relative connection with the object. Ruth Gridley, listed on page 3 of the object as one of the Art Shop's new management, is my first cousin; Loren of course is my brother. But we still think the Loren data is separate in the main from the envelope data.</td><td>(“我相信你的弟弟洛伦是在场的其中一人。数字17，7月的一个日期对他，或他的亲密家人很重要——不一定是对他，你知道。”我们没有要求这样的资料；它是自发地传过来的。为什么赛斯可以选择在信封资料中插入它，我们看到了一个原因，而赛斯后来也证实了我们的推测。我们的想法是，赛斯试图使用一个与物件相关联的概念。露丝•葛瑞德利，是物件第三页列出的商店新管理阶层成员之一，她是我的表姊；洛伦当然是我的弟弟。但我们仍然认为洛伦资料基本上和信封资料是分开的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Now Seth answered the question: “A rectangular object, with white background. Also gray.” The object is rectangular. It has a white background. There is no gray on the object, but as soon as she saw the fine print on page 3, Jane said this to her meant the impression of gray.</td><td>(现在赛斯回答了这个问题:“一个长方形的物件，有白色背景。也是灰色的。”物件是长方形。它有着白色背景。物件上没有任何灰色，但是一看到第三页上的小字时，珍说这对她来说意味着灰色的印象。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A connection with a future event.” Future events are implied by the object through the copy on page 3: “Continuing under new management.” (Jane resumed at 11:12, speaking very jovially, her eyes open.)</td><td>(“和一个未来事件有关联。”透过第三页的副本，物件暗示了未来事件：“正由新的管理阶层继续经营中。”(珍在11:12继续，非常快活地说话，眼睛是睁开的。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will now close our session, out of my due passionate regard for you.

It had the habit of coming and going at all hours. Last night Jane let it in at about I AM, after hearing it scratching at the backdoor. In order to do this she had to fully dress before walking down the long hall outside our apartment. Jane fed the cat and locked our apartment door as usual before returning to bed. I know she was up at this time because she woke me getting back into bed, and told me the second cat had come home. I also heard this cat and our first cat, Willy, playing in the living room.</td><td>(最近我们收养了第二只猫，一只流浪猫。它的习惯是，任何时间都来来去去。昨晚，珍听到它在抓后门，于是在凌晨一点左右让它进来。为了这么做，她必须先穿好衣服，再走到我们公寓外面长长的走廊。珍喂了这只猫，然后像往常一样把我们的公寓门锁上，再回到床上。我知道她当时起床，是因为她回到床上的时候叫醒了我，告诉我第二只猫回家了。我也听到这只猫和我们的第一只猫，威立，在客厅玩耍。</td></tr><tr><td>(When we got up this morning cat number two was nowhere to be found. The hall door was locked. When I went to work this morning Jane went out to the garage with me. After I left, she found cat number two in the yard. Question: How did the cat get there? We decided to ask Seth tonight.</td><td>(当我们今天早晨起床时，到处都找不到第二只猫。走廊的门是锁上的。今天早上我要上班时，珍和我一起去了车库。我离开之后，她在院子里找到了第二只猫。问题：猫是怎么到那里的？我们决定今晚问赛斯。</td></tr><tr><td>(Broad smile, eyes wide open.) I should never be the one to tell you this, for my friend Ruburt will be after me with a broom next.</td><td>(笑容满面，眼睛大睁)我永远不应该是那个告诉你这件事的人，因为我的朋友鲁柏接下来会拿着扫帚追着我打。</td></tr><tr><td>("Why?”)</td><td>(“为什么？”)</td></tr><tr><td>Someone in this household walked in their sleep, and opened the door. The cat is not good at projection. Our friend Ruburt does not remember his nocturnal walk. Since we are with friends, I will tell you that he remembered his womanly modesty even in his sleep, and he once more donned the clothes that he donned earlier, you see, when he let the cat in.</td><td>这个家里的某个人睡着后梦游，开了门。猫不擅长投射。我们的朋友鲁柏不记得他的夜间散步。因为我们和朋友在一起，所以我会告诉你，他甚至在睡觉中都不忘他的女性端庄仪态，他再次穿上他稍早前穿的衣服，你看，也就是他让猫进来的时候。</td></tr><tr><td>The dear little pussies annoyed him. He was too lazy, you see, to rise from bed. He wanted to sleep. He had his cake and ate it too.</td><td>这亲爱的小猫咪惹恼了他。你看，他懒得从床上起来。他想睡觉。他拿出蛋糕，还把它吃了。</td></tr><tr><td>( I fell back to sleep at once after seeing Jane return to bed at I AM. Jane said she remembered that the two cats were very noisy as they played together in the dark apartment, and that she remembered wishing they would stop. But she had no memory of getting up a second time, dressing, etc., to put cat number two out again.) Now, I am—you may or may not take notes now, Joseph—you see, rather present with you this evening...</td><td>(看到珍在凌晨一点回到床上后，我立刻又睡着。珍说她记得两只猫在黑暗的公寓里一起玩耍时非常吵闹，也记得她希望它们会停下来。但她对于第二次起床、穿衣等等，以便放第二只猫出去，却毫无记忆。)现在，我——你可以写或可以不写笔记，约瑟——今天晚上相当投入地和你们在一起……</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth was in an excellent and humorous mood, and spoke for a while longer. I stopped taking verbatim notes at 11:20. Seth spoke to the Wilburs and me about the implications behind the death of the young robin, among other things, and verified that the Loren data in the envelope experiment was also intended to use the relative idea to tie it to the envelope object and my cousin Ruth.</td><td>(赛斯心情非常好，充满幽默，而多说了一段时间的话。我在11:20分停止逐字记录。赛斯向韦伯夫妇和我讲述年幼知更鸟死背后的含义，以及其他事情，并且证实了信封实验的洛伦资料是打算使用相关的概念，把它和信封物件与我的表姊露丝连在一起。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth called it a night, presumably, at 11:30, but then returned, still in a fine and smiling mood. He said Jane would not like the sleepwalking idea, which Jane confirmed later. He also told Marilyn Wilbur that he saw her, through Jane's eyes, as an individual—a question Marilyn had raised earlier in the evening. In the past on various occasions Seth has said he usually sees witnesses, and myself, as a composite electromagnetic image that embodies our past, present and future, as well as these attributes in whatever other lives we might have had. He has explained that this is easier, usually, than focusing so sharply on the one physical and psychic personality in our temporal now.</td><td>(大概在11:30分，赛斯说今晚到此为止，然后又回来了，心情依然很好也带着微笑。他说珍不会喜欢这个梦游的想法，珍后来证实了这一点。他还告诉到玛丽莲•韦伯，他透过珍的眼睛，看到她这个人——这是玛丽莲今晚早些时候提到的一个问题。在过去的各种场合里，赛斯说他通常看到见证人和我自己，是一个复合电磁意象，体现我们过去、现在和未来，以及我们可能有过的任何其他生命所属的特性。他解释说，相较于如此集中聚集在我们短暂当下的一个物质和心灵人格上，这样比较容易。</td></tr><tr><td>(The Wilburs left us. Jane and I thought the session over, but Seth returned briejly again at about 11:45, to comment in a hearty manner that during the physical lives Jane, Seth and I lived together in Denmark, during the 1600s, I did him out of considerable money. Bits and pieces of our reincarnational material crop up throughout the sessions.</td><td>(韦伯夫妇离开了。珍和我以为这一节结束了，但赛斯大约在11:45分又回来一小段时间，用一种充满热忱的方式评论说，在几世的物质生命中，珍、赛斯和我于17世纪一起住在丹麦，我害他损失了相当多的钱。我们的转世资料在课间会一点一滴出现。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth returned once more at 11:54, this time again in answer to our speculations concerning the second cat and Jane's sleepwalking episode. Here is the rest of the story involving the second cat: After I left for work and Jane had taken the cat into the house, she discovered to her sorrow that the cat had somehow gotten its lower jaw caught in a new collar we had put on it the day before, and that evidently the cat's lower jaw had been forced open in this strained position for some hours. Jane had to use scissors to cut the collar off. The cat promptly fell into a stupor us sleep, that lasted all day.</td><td>(赛斯在11:54分再次回来，这次又回答了我们对和第二只猫和珍的梦游情节所做的猜测。和第二只猫有关的故事，剩下的部分是：我出门去工作后，珍把猫带进屋子里，她很难过地发现猫的下颚不知怎样卡在我们前一天给它套上的新项圈上，而且显然猫的下颚卡在这个不上不下的位置而被迫张开已经几小时了，珍不得不用剪刀把项圈剪断。猫很快就沉睡得一动也不动，整整睡了一天。</td></tr><tr><td>(We were wondering how long the animal had been forced to struggle with its jaws open in this manner when Seth came through. Jane spoke with her eyes open while standing quietly by a table. Seth told us that Jane, in her sleep, put the cat back out at 3 AM. The cat got its lower jaw caught in the collar “shortly after,” and remained so caught until we found it shortly after 7:30 AM.</td><td>(当赛斯过来时，我们正在想这只猫被迫以这种方式张开下颚而挣扎的时间有多长。珍安静地站在一张桌子旁边，睁着眼睛说话。赛斯告诉我们，珍在睡觉时，于凌晨3点又把猫放出去。“不久之后”，猫的下颚就卡在项圈里，而且一直卡着，直到我们在早上7:30分过后不久发现它为止。</td></tr><tr><td>(Thus Seth returned three times in all. Jane had been well dissociated each time.)</td><td>(就这样，赛斯总共回来三次。珍每次都完全出离。)</td></tr><tr><td>IMPRESSIONS ATTACHED TOSESSION 268 FRIDAY, JUNE 17, 1966</td><td>1966年6月17日星期五第268节的附加印象</td></tr><tr><td>(The following are the impressions Jane received at 10:22 while holding Don Wilbur's watch:)</td><td>(以下是珍拿着唐•韦伯的手表，在10:22接收到的印象：)</td></tr><tr><td>1943</td><td>1、1943年。</td></tr><tr><td>April date.</td><td>2、4月的日期。</td></tr><tr><td>tall man with grey hair...sort of prickly.</td><td>3、头发灰白的高个子男人……有点刺刺的。</td></tr><tr><td>a connection with someone else beside Don with the watch.</td><td>4、与有手表的唐身边的另一个人有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>*correct—the watch was a gift from his wife.</td><td>*正确——手表是他妻子送的礼物。</td></tr><tr><td>small stupid incident immediately before or after the purchase.</td><td>5、在买表之前或之后立刻发生的愚蠢小事。</td></tr><tr><td>*correct—It was a Christmas gift and he had bought the same item, a watch for his wife.

The results were well below par however. Jane was very tired before the session, although she said she felt fine when I questioned her. Had I realized how tired she was the session would not have been held; both of us have been extremely busy lately and cramped for time. Jane said she did not let me know she was tired, because under such circumstances sometimes excellent material has come through.</td><td>(信封实验结果包含了几个有效的重点。不过，结果远远低于标准。珍在课前非常疲累，虽然当我问她时，她说她觉得还好。我要是知道她有多累，这一节就不举行了；我们两个人最近都很忙，时间不够用。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane was smoking when the session began, and her eyes were open from the beginning.

There were some notes I wanted to give you concerning dreams in which you feel certain that you are awake. When these dreams are unusually vivid, then the ego is aware of participating. The ego is not using its critical faculties however as a general rule.</td><td>现在。关于你感觉自己确实醒着的梦，我想给你一些注。当这些梦异常生动时，自我对参与是有觉知的。然而，一般来说，自我并没有在使用它的批判能力。</td></tr><tr><td>As you realize, you can use the critical faculties. But you see when you do so you realize that you are not in your normal waking condition. In awake-seeming dreams you are indeed awake, within of course a different psychological framework. Indeed, within a different framework of reality.</td><td>你明白，你可以使用批判能力。但是你看，当你这样做的时候，你晓得你就不是在平常的醒时状态。在看似醒着的梦中，你确实是醒着的，当然是在一个不同的心理架构之内。甚至，是在一个不同的实相架构之内。</td></tr><tr><td>You are operating at a rather high level of awareness, and you are using inner senses. These enable you to perceive an added depth or dimension, and this is responsible for the increased sense of vividness, and also for the sense of exhilaration that sometimes occurs within this particular sort of dream.</td><td>你在一个相当高的觉知层面上运作，而且你正在使用内在感官。这些感官让你能够感知一个额外的深度或次元，而生动的感觉之所以增强，还有在这一类的梦中之所以有时会产生兴奋的感觉，这就是原因。</td></tr><tr><td>The next step of course is to allow the ego to use its critical faculties also within the dream state. You are then able to realize that while you are indeed awake, as you seem, you are awake within a different condition.</td><td>当然，下一步是容许自我也能在梦状态之内使用它的批判能力。然后你就能够明了，当你确实醒来时，像你看似如此那样，你是在一个不同的状况下醒来。</td></tr><tr><td>When this occurs you will be able to use your normal abilities in addition to other abilities used while in the dream state itself. You will be certain of your identity. You will realize that your physical self is sleeping, or in a dream state, and that the inner self is fully awake. Now this represents a definite increase in the scope of consciousness, and a considerable expansion over the usual limitations set by you upon the self.</td><td>在发生这种情况下，除了在梦状态中使用的其他能力以外，你还可以使用平常的能力。你会对自己的本体有把握。你会发觉内向的自己正在睡觉，或处于梦状态中，也会发觉内我是完全醒着的。现在，这代表意识的范围明确增大，而且你对自己设下的惯常限制也有相当大的扩展。</td></tr><tr><td>Only then can you fully begin to manipulate the conditions that exist, and communicate the knowledge that you receive to your own ego. For the time, you see, the ego becomes a direct participator in such experiences—at least to some degree.</td><td>唯有到那时候，你才能完全开始操纵现存的状况，并且把你接收到的知识传达给你自己的自我。在这时候，你看，自我就变成这种经验的直接参与者——至少在某种程度上。</td></tr><tr><td>Almost all of your dream experiences do involve projection of one kind or another. These experiences vary in intensity, type, and even duration as any other experiences vary. It takes a good deal of training and competence to operate with any real effectiveness within these situations.</td><td>几乎所有的梦经验都涉及到某一种投射。任何其他的经验都各有不同，同样地，这些经验的强度、类型，甚至持续时间也都各有不同。要在这些情况之内真正有效地运作，需要大量的训练和才能。</td></tr><tr><td>All in all the intellect plays some part, but the intuitional qualities are the most important. There are chemical changes that occur with the physical body when projections occur. There are also electromagnetic variations. These vary according to the form in which the projection occurs.</td><td>总而言之，智力发挥了一定作用，但直觉性质是最重要的。当投射发生时，肉体会发生化学变化。还有电磁变化。这些变化是根据投射时采用的形式而定。</td></tr><tr><td>The projected form does make some impression upon your physical system. In other words, it is possible for it to be detected. It is a kind of pseudo image, materialistically speaking, but it has definite electromagnetic reality, and chemical properties.</td><td>被投射的形式的确会给你的物质系统留下某个印象。换句话说，要察觉到它是可能的。从物质上来讲，它是一种伪意象，但它具有明确的电磁实相和化学属性。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Animals have indeed sensed such apparitions. There is hardly any magic involved. They react to the chemical properties of the apparition, and build up the image from it—from them, the properties.</td><td>现在。动物确实感应到这样的显灵。其中几乎没有涉及任何魔法。它们对显灵的化学属性作出反应，并且从它——从它们，种种属性，开始逐步建立意象属性。</td></tr><tr><td>These chemical properties however are more diffuse in an apparition than in a physical form. The chemical composition of a storm perhaps will give you an idea of what I mean. They are indeed small disturbances, you see—they form small disturbances within your physical system.</td><td>然而，这些化学属性在一个显灵之中比在物质形式之中更加分散。风暴的化学成分也许会让你透过这想法明白我的意思。它们的确是小骚动，你看——它们在你的物质系统之内形成小骚动。</td></tr><tr><td>As a rule they are not solid in the same way that clouds are not solid, and yet they have shape, and to a certain extent boundaries, and of course movement. They definitely have a reality, you see, though you cannot usually perceive it with the physical senses.</td><td>一般来说，它们和云一样都不坚固，但它们有形状，而且在某种程度上也有边界，当然还有动作。你看，它们肯定有一个实相，但是你通常无法用肉体感官来感知它。</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps this diffused quality is the most important difference between such an apparition and a physical form. There is an atomic structure. In some ways however the structure is less complete than a physical form. There is always a minute difference in the physical body’s normal weight when the individual is projecting. The excess chemicals built up during the waking condition are used to help form the projecting images. There is a slight loss of electromagnetic potency and chemical potency when the individual is projecting.</td><td>也许这种分散的性质是这种类型与物质形式之间最重要的差别。有一个原子结构。然而，在某些方面，这个结构不如物质形式完整。当个体在投射时，肉体的正常体重总是有微小的差异。在醒时状况下积累的多余化学物质，被用来帮助投射意象的形成。当个体在投射时，电磁效力和化学效力会有轻微的损耗。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take your break, and I shall continue.</td><td>你可以先休息一下，我再继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:30. Jane had been dissociated as usual. She knew her eyes had been open most of the time. Her voice had not been as strong as usual lately however. She remarked casually that she felt somewhat tired. Her delivery had been quite active and emphatic though.</td><td>(9:30休息。珍像往常一样出离。她知道她的眼睛大部分时间都是张开的。不过，她的声音最近不像往常那样有力。她随口提到她感觉有点累。但是她的传述非常活泼而且话多强调。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same manner at 9:46.)</td><td>(9:46分，珍以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>There is much to be considered here. Identity is not dependent upon physical existence.</td><td>这里有很多要考虑的问题。本体不依赖于物质存在。</td></tr><tr><td>Electromagnetic reality belongs to the inner self. It is not a property that belongs to physical matter, although it does appear in physical terms. (Pause.) The second and third projection forms have electromagnetic realities. (Pause.) We are going slow here to get this material through clearly.</td><td>电磁实相属于内我。尽管它确实以物质方式出现，但它并不是一个属于实体物质的属性。(停顿)第二种和第三种投射形式具有电磁实相。(停顿)我们在这里放慢速度，好让这个资料清楚地传过来。</td></tr><tr><td>The chemical properties of the body are the result of certain electromagnetic changes. Chemicals are therefore byproducts of electromagnetic realities. The electromagnetic properties, again, belong to the psychic, not the physical structure.</td><td>身体的化学属性是某些电磁变化的结果。因此，化学物是电磁实相的副产品。再一次，电磁属性属于心灵结构，而不是物质结构。</td></tr><tr><td>In physical existence a certain portion of the inner self ’s electromagnetic properties are used by the physical structure of the body. Subtle changes occur in the body when the inner self projects. This projection is not dependent upon physical life—that is, the survival of the human personality also is then not dependent upon physical survival, nor need it be supported by physical life. The electromagnetic properties simply revert to their original source with the inner self, and are no longer utilized in the construction of a corporeal image.</td><td>在物质存在中，身体的物质结构使用了内我某一部分的电磁属性。当内我投射时，身体发生微妙的变化。这种投射不依赖物质生命——也就是说，那时候人类人格的存活不依赖肉体的存活，也不需要物质生命的支持。电磁属性就只是随着内我回归它们最初的源头，不再用于身体形相的建构。</td></tr><tr><td>All consciousness exists first and primarily in electromagnetic terms, although consciousness may project itself into many various forms. It is never completely imprisoned within those forms however. You see, I have somewhat explained this to you. (Smile.) As physical beings your perception, your physical perception, is slowed down to a necessary but very extensive degree.</td><td>虽然意识可以把自己投射到很多不同的形式之中，但是所有的意识首先而且主要存在电磁之内。然而，它永远不会完全被禁锢在这些形式中。你看，我多少已经向你解释过这一点了。(微笑)身为物质存在体，你的感知，你的肉体感知，减慢到一个必要但非常广泛的程度。</td></tr><tr><td>The span of a whole man’s lifetime is no more than a moment point. The ego is the portion of you equipped to explore and experience this moment point in depth. (Smile.) Value fulfillment demands this slowing down of perception. This is most difficult to explain. Consider using psychological time. You have experiences within a few physical moments of physical time, experiences that are entirely independent of your time structure.</td><td>人的一生寿命不过是一个片刻点而已。自我是你能够用来探索和体验这个片刻点的那个部分。(微笑)价值完成需要感知的这种减速。这很难解释。想想心理时间的运用。你在物理时间的几个物理时刻之内获得经验，这些经验完全独立于你们的时间结构之外。</td></tr><tr><td>You are exploring the inner contents of a moment, delving into its experience. Now this is what the ego does you see within a lifetime, only to a greater degree. In projections, and in your dreams, your perceptions to some extent enable you to leap out of the ego’s time limitations. The physical body is indeed the ego’s vehicle. You do not need it, you see, for projections.</td><td>你正在探索一个片刻的内在内容，钻研它的经验。现在，这就是，你看，自我在一生中所做的事，只不过程度更大而已。在投射中，还有在你的梦中，你的感知在某种程度上使你能够跨出自我的时间限制。肉体确实是自我的载体。你看，你的投射并不需要用到它。</td></tr><tr><td>(Smile, pause.) We have just covered some rather important material, and we shall discuss it more thoroughly. You may take a brief break before our Instream data.</td><td>(微笑，停顿)我们刚刚谈到一些相当重要的资料，而且我们会讨论得更加彻底。你可以在我们的殷斯翠姆资料之前暂时休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:04.

Again, a connection with a disturbance, with a knife. This is the pointed impression. I do not know if the knife is literal. Sharp, something sharp.</td><td>颜色为绿色、黄色。尖尖的花或星形。再一次，和一场骚动、一把小刀有关联。这是一个尖的印象。我不知道刀是不是字面上的意思。尖锐，某个尖锐的东西。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt thinks of a newspaper article, about a murder. A formal affair of a conventional social nature. An inadequacy. Something canceled or expired. The color white and four lines, perhaps with white between them.</td><td>鲁柏想到一篇关于谋杀案的报纸文章。具有传统社会性质的一个正式事件。一个不足之处。取消或过期的东西。白色和四条线，也许和它们之间的白色有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have any questions? Red and white squares connected here.</td><td>你有任何问题吗？这里和红色和白色正方形有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>(l had the choice of trying to guide Seth back to the object through questions, or of hying again with new data. It had soon become clear that the impressions were ofj, although at this time I didn't know why. Seth's accuracy had picked up toward the end of the data, however. Jane sat waiting.</td><td>(我有机会利用问题尝试引导赛斯回到物件上，或利用新的资料再试一次。很快就会清楚地看到印象已经偏离主题了，尽管此时我不知道为什么。然而，接近资料的结尾，赛斯的准确度又提高了。珍坐着等。</td></tr><tr><td>("Do you want to try another set of impressions?")</td><td>(“你想不想要试试另一组印象？”)</td></tr><tr><td>Very well, give us a moment please.

Jane had been dissociated as usual. When she came out of trance now her eyes were bleary, and it was obvious that she was not at her best. She said that she knew the first data was off when I asked if she wanted to try again.</td><td>(10:26休息。珍像往常一样出离。当她脱离出神状态时，两眼惺忪，显然不是她的最佳状态。她说当我问她想不想要再试一次时，她就知道第一个资料偏离了主题。</td></tr><tr><td>(Strangely enough, she had two good images while giving the inaccurate data, she said—one image for each set of data. The first concerned a card shape, rectangudar , with balancing designs on each end of it while held horizontally. See page 255. The second image was of the target shape also mentioned on page 255.</td><td>(她说，奇怪的是，在给出了不准确的资料时，她有两个贴切的意象——每组资料都有一个意象。第一个意象是卡片形状，长方形，横向拿着它，它的两侧都有平衡的设计。第二个意象是前面提到的靶形。</td></tr><tr><td>(We will interpret the data we feel applies. Jane, incidentally, said she never used the word smidgeon that she knew of. See the rubbing of the envelope object on page 250, and the notes on the next page.</td><td>(我们将会解读我们认为适用的资料。顺便一提，珍说她从来不曾用过她知道的“smidgeon”[极少量]这个字。见前面信封物件拓印件，以及注释。</td></tr><tr><td>(From the first data, page 255: “Pointed flower or star shapes. Again, a connection with a disturbance, with a knife. This is the pointed impression. I do not know if the knife is literal. Sharp, something sharp... Ruburt thinks of a newspaper article, about a murder." Seth also mentioned a connection with turbulence at the start of the data. There can be a direct connection with the envelope object, and a newspaper connection; it seems that both are somewhat distorted, and that one perhaps influenced the other.</td><td>(开始的资讯:“尖尖的花或星形。再一次，和一场骚动、一把小刀有关联。这是一个尖的印象。我不知道刀是不是字面上的意思。尖锐，某个尖锐的东西。鲁柏想到一篇关于谋杀案的报纸文章。”在资料一开头，赛斯还提到骚乱的关联。可以和信封物件有直接的关联，而且和报纸有关联；似乎两者都有些扭曲，而且其中一个可能影响了另一个。</td></tr><tr><td>(As indicated on page 251, the object was cut off the edge of the wood panel with a razor blade; the blade had to be sharp to slice cleanly through cloth, and such cuts were made on two sides of the object.</td><td>(如前面所示，用剃刀的刀片把物件从木板的边缘切下来；刀片必须锋利，才能彻底切开布料，而且是在物件的两侧进行这样的切割。</td></tr><tr><td>(As always when doing such work, I spread newspapers on my drawing table. Jane saw me doing this, and knew I was experimenting gluing the burlap to panels to make painting surfaces. I made this particular panel from which the envelope object came on Saturday afternoon, June 18.</td><td>(在做这样的工作时，一如既往，我都会在我的绘图桌铺上报纸。珍看过我这样做。也知道我在尝试把粗麻布黏在木板上，来制作画布的表面，我是在6月18日星期六下午制作了这一个木板，也就是信封物件的来源。</td></tr><tr><td>(The newspaper connection also developed because on the front page of todays paper for June 20th, was the story of a local woman being murdered with a knife. So although I used newspapers while developing the envelope object, I couldn't have used the particular newspaper which carried the murder story, since this news developed two days later. Jane and I had talked about the stabbing at supper this evening however, and evidently the knife connection here and with the object caused the distortions.</td><td>(之所以也产生报纸的关联，是因为今天6月20日的报纸头版，报导当地一名妇女被人用刀杀死的故事。所以，虽然我在研制信封物件时用了报纸，但我不可能用这张刊登这起谋杀案的报导，因为这个消息是两天后才出现的。然而，今晚在晚餐时，珍和我谈到刺杀事件，显然这里与刀的关联以及和物件的关联造成了扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>(At the end of Seth's second try at the envelope data, he once again came up with the newspaper connection: “Still, there seems to be a newspaper connection. Printing or black ink, I do not know.” The black ink connection is interesting to me. As I worked with the materials on the newspapers, I wondered whether it was such a good idea, fearing that perhaps the acrylic glue I was using might dissolve the black printing ink enough to cause it to dirty the white burlap I was handling. There was no real trouble although I did get a few faint smudges on the burlap; I removed them without trouble. I do not know if Seth referred to this, or merely black ink being connected with newspapers.</td><td>(在赛斯第二次尝试信封资料时，他再次提出报纸的关联：“不过，似乎和报纸有关联。印刷或黑色油墨，我不知道。”我觉得黑色油墨的关联很有意思。当我在报纸上使用这些材料时，我怀疑过这是不是一个好主意，担心我使用的丙烯酸胶水可能溶解黑色印刷油墨，而弄脏我正在处理的白色粗麻布。没有太大的麻烦，但是粗麻布上的确有一些模糊的污迹；我毫不费力就清除掉了。我不知道赛斯指的是这个，或仅仅是和报纸有关的黑色油墨。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed with her eyes closed and at a slow rate at 10:49.)</td><td>(10:49，珍闭着眼睛继续，速度缓慢。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will close our session.</td><td>我们要结束我们的课了。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt was simply exhausted, and that is all.</td><td>鲁柏根本就筋疲力尽了，就是这样。</td></tr><tr><td>The object did not have sufficient emotional connections to offset his exhaustion. The yellow piece of burlap might have done this.</td><td>这个物件没有足够的情感连结，来抵消他的疲惫。这可能是那块黄色粗麻布造成的。</td></tr><tr><td>(We bought two colors of burlap while shopping Saturday, the white I used to experiment with, and a piece of light yellow that I gave to Jane. Jane had become involved with the yellow material, trying it out as a curtain, slipcover, tablecloth, etc., and she made plans to buy some more. She had become quite enthusiastic over the idea.)</td><td>(星期六购物时，我们买了两种颜色的粗麻布，这块我以前试过的白布，以及我给珍的一块浅黄色的布。珍变得很爱用这块布料，试着用它做窗帘、套子、桌布等等，她计划再买一些。她对这个想法非常热衷。)</td></tr><tr><td>The newspaper connection was correct, as you thought, and the sharpness. His own associations operated, though he did not realize it. It is to be expected at times, and is quite natural.</td><td>和你想的一样，报纸的关联是正确的，还有尖锐锋利也是。他自己的联想在运作，但他没有发觉。有时候，这是意料中的事，也很自然。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, my heartiest wishes to you both.</td><td>现在，我衷心祝福你们俩位。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good night, Seth.”</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 10:52.

Her voice remained quiet; there were many people in the yard outside our windows but it was too warm to close ourselves in.)</td><td>(这节一开始，珍抽着烟，她的眼睛很快就开始睁开。她一直轻声细语；在我们窗户外面的院子里有很多人，但是太暖和了，我们没办法不开窗。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening, dear friends.</td><td>晚安，亲爱的朋友们。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>My dear Joseph, there are indeed balances that operate. You need not fear that subconsciously you are going to invite hordes into your home, nor that Ruburt will subconsciously do so.</td><td>亲爱的约瑟，确实有平衡在运作。你不必害怕你会邀请一群群人进来你们家，而鲁柏在潜意识里也不会这么做。</td></tr><tr><td>There is also something you forget. You are your subconscious self, and oftentimes what makes no sense to the ego makes good sense to the overall personality. Still, there are psychological balances that always operate when the overall personality gestalt is operating effectively, as it is in both of your cases.</td><td>还有一件事你忘记了。你就是你的潜意识自己，对自我没有意义的东西往往对整体人格是有意义的。尽管如此，当整体人格完形正在有效运作时，就像你们两人的情况那样，平衡仍然一直在运作。</td></tr><tr><td>The overall needs of the personality are always taken into consideration by what I have called in the past the inner ego. Now this portion of the self is indeed self-conscious in the highest meaning of the term—aware of the subconscious portion of the personality, aware of the primary conscious framework that you call your ego, and constantly directs the overall activities. This portion is aware of the complicated workings of the nervous system and all bodily functions. It is the overseer. It knows when to allow subconscious needs and wishes their fulfillment. It knows when to put fulfillment off for a time. It is this part of the personality that is in charge of overall stability.</td><td>我过去所谓的内心自我向来都会考虑到人格的整体需求。现在，这部分的自己确实是有着最高层意义的自我意识——对人格的潜意识部分是有觉知的，对你称之为自我的主要意识架构是有觉知的，而且持续不断指挥全部的活动。这个部分对神经系统和所有身体功能的复杂运作是有觉知的。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. This inner ego can also operate within the dream state, and in certain awake-seeming dreams it is the portion that realizes that the personality is not in its normal waking condition. It is this portion of the self that is with you in the most excellent projections. The inner ego is the part of the personality that contains the highest aspirations and capabilities. It has been called by psychologists the subliminal self.</td><td>它是监督者。它知道允许潜意识的需求和愿望得以实现，它知道何时停顿实现。负责整体稳定的正是人格的这个部分</td></tr><tr><td>When in such dreams your perceptions seem exceedingly clear, you can be certain that the inner ego is operating. Now all portions of the personality, of the present personality, belong to this inner ego. It functions constantly, and yet it is always in a state of becoming. It is more than what you are at any given moment in your time. It contains, and j^, the psychological blueprint containing the full potential of the present personality within any given incarnation.</td><td>现在。这个内在自我也可以在梦状态中运作，而且在某些看似醒着的梦中，发觉人格不在它平常的醒时状态也正是它。在最佳的投射中与你同在的，正是自己的这个部分。内在自我是人格当中具有最高的抱负和能力的那个部分。心理学家称之为阈下的自己(subliminal self)。</td></tr><tr><td>It is the director of all the subsidiary psychological subpersonalities that form the acting-present primary personality. It gives and takes. It prevents unconstructed aspects from gaining control, unless of course there are strong reasons why such control is necessary in the long run.</td><td>在这样的梦中，你的感知似乎清晰至极，你可以确定内在自我正在运作。现在，人格，现有人格的所有部分，都属于这个内在自我。它持续不断运转，但始终处于变为的状态。它不只是你在你们的时间当中任何既定时刻的你所是而已。它包含而且就是心理蓝图，现有人格在任何既定的转世之内的全部潜力就包含在这个蓝图之中。</td></tr><tr><td>It dabbles in both your future and your past, speaking now in your terms. As you create a painting, and the painting is still an aspect of yourself, so it creates the whole personality, which is an aspect of itself. It operates in both the waking and the dream state. It often forms the content of each. It is more knowledgeable than any one aspect of the personality. It is more knowledgeable than all other aspects of the personality, for it forms them together into a cohesive whole.</td><td>它是所有附属心理次要人格的指挥者，这些次人格形成了行动-当下的主要人格。它有施也有受。它阻止没有建构好的面向取得控制，当然，除非有充分的理由证明长远来说这种控制是必要的。它涉足你的未来和你的过去，我现在是用你们的说法在讲。就像你创作一幅画，这幅画仍然是你自己的一个面向，所以它创造整个人格，整个人格也是它自己的一个面向。它在醒时状态也在梦状态当中运作。每一个的内容通常是由它形成的。它比人格的任何一个面向更有见识。它比人格任何一个面向更为博学，因为是它把它们组合成为一个有凝聚力的整体。</td></tr><tr><td>It is therefore the director of afi activities, both in the waking and dream condition. It is the inner ego from whom you receive your inspiration, and it is the inner ego which gives consent to our meetings.</td><td>因此，无论是在醒时还是在梦中，它都是所有活动的指挥者。你的灵感就是从内在自我接收来的，而同意我们聚会的也是内在自我。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take a break, and we shall continue.</td><td>你可以休息一下，我们再继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:22. Jane was well dissociated, her manner very active, eyes open often, smoking, etc. Resume at 9:31.)</td><td>(9:22休息。珍完全出离，她的态度很活泼，经常睁开眼睛、抽烟等等。9:31继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>I told you from the beginning that the inner ego is aware of data that is received through the inner senses as well as data from the outer senses.</td><td>我从一开始就告诉你，内在自我对透过内在感官接收的资料以及来自外在感官的资料是有觉知的。</td></tr><tr><td>It is the prime identity of the whole present personality. In many cases it is the I of your dreams. It is definitely the I of your creative activity. It is the I, you see, which survives physical existence, and the physical, physically-oriented ego is only a part of it.</td><td>内在自我是整个现有人格的主要本体。在很多情况下，它是你梦里的那个“我”(I)。它绝对是你的创造活动里的那个我。你看，在物质存在之后存活下来的是那个我，而物质导向的自我只是它的一部分而已。</td></tr><tr><td>If only the physically-oriented ego survived, very little indeed would survive at all. The physically-oriented ego is hardly aware of your experiences in their entirety. The physically-oriented ego, if it alone survived, would contain only your conscious memories. Even now, in physical existence, you operate on a much deeper and more complicated level than this. Events and experiences which are forgotten, or which escaped the physically-oriented ego, still affect your activities in this life, and if they did not your physical existence would be brief indeed.</td><td>如果只有物质导向的自我存活下来，那么存活下来的其实根本就少之又少。物质导向的自我对你的整体经验几乎毫无知觉。物质导向的自我，如果它独自存活下来的话，就只包含你的意识记忆而已。即使是现在，在物质存在中，你都是在比这还要深入很多也更为复杂的层次上运作。被遗忘或逃脱物质导向自我掌控的事件和经验，仍然影响着你在这一生的活动，而且，如果它们不是这样，你的物质存在确实会很短暂。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane pounded the tabletop for emphasis, eyes wide and dark.)</td><td>(珍敲击桌面以示强调，双眼张大而且颜色很深)</td></tr><tr><td>Any survival that was based upon the survival of the physically-oriented ego alone would be as shallow as a paper cutout. These things escape you. You take it for granted that the physically-oriented ego represents your own psychological identity, you see, and this is an illusion. It contains a portion of your psychological feeling of identity, but only that.</td><td>任何独以物质导向的自我为基础的存活都是像剪纸一样肤浅。你没有注意到这些事情。你理所当然地以为物质导向的自我就代表你自己的心理本体，但这是一个幻相。它包含了你在心理上对本体的一部分感觉，但就只是这样而已。</td></tr><tr><td>Feelings and sensations and memories that it knows nothing of have built up your psychological identity, and given you a sense of continuity. Of these this ego knows but little. Intimacy with your self and with your own identity, that is intimate knowledge of your own identity, resides in all portions of the self, and is not dependent upon a survival based upon the survival of the physically-oriented ego. This would represent a sham of a survival indeed.</td><td>它一无所知的感觉和知觉以及记忆建立了你的心理本体，给你一种连续感。对于这些，这个自我知之甚少。熟知你的自己以及你自己的本体，亦即深入了解你自己的本体，这种亲密与自知就存在于自己的所有部分之中，而且不依赖以物质导向自我的存活为基础的生存。这确实代表生存的假象。</td></tr><tr><td>There is a basic difference you see between a survival personality, and the personality as you know it. The individual in physical life shows his surface face, so to speak, outward. Inner psychological realities are hidden beneath the physically-oriented ego simply because it cannot afford to deal with them. Its one main purpose is simply to allow the personality to operate effectively within its physical environment.</td><td>在一个死后犹存的人格与你所知的人格之间，你看，有一个基本的差别。在物质生命中的个体，可以说，向外展现他表面的那张脸。内在心理实相隐藏在物质导向的自我之下，只因为它没有能力处理它们。它的主要目的之一就只是，让人格在它的物质环境之内有效运作而已。</td></tr><tr><td>The surviving personality has a different psychological balance. The outer ego no longer shows its outside face, so to speak, (again Jane struck the tabletop) but takes its place with the other aspects of the personality. You might say that ]t becomes the subconscious, although I am speaking now simply to get the idea across, and this is not precisely the case.</td><td>死后犹存的人格有一种不同的心理平衡。外在自我不再秀出，可以说，它外在的那张脸(珍再次敲击桌面)，而是以人格的其他面向取而代之。你可以说它变成潜意识，不过，我现在这样讲只是想把这个概念解释清楚而已，事实并不完全是如此。</td></tr><tr><td>It is true however to say that the memories of the physically-oriented ego take their place with memories that were once subconscious. I am speaking now of the psychological makeup of the survival personality. The memories remain in physical existence. There is no real distinction between psychological reality and physical reality. The physically-oriented ego manufactures this distinction of necessity.</td><td>然而，说物质自我的记忆以曾经是潜意识的记忆取而代之，的确是事实。我现在说的是死后犹存人格的心理构造。记忆仍然保留在物质存在中。实相与物质实相之间没有真正的区别。物质导向的自我出于必要而制造了这种区别。</td></tr><tr><td>The survival personality does not need to do this. To him all realities are psychological realities, a thought as real as a chair—in fact, much more real. Therefore, communications between survival personalities and physically-oriented personalities are bound to suffer difficulties, and these difficulties are the result of the change of psychological frameworks.</td><td>死后犹存的人格不需要这么做。对他来说，所有的实相都是心理实相，一个思想和一张椅子一样真实——事实上，更加真实多了。因此，存活的人格与物质导向的人格之间的沟通必然会遇到困难，而这些困难是心理架构变化的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>We are going to have a brief session this evening, and after a break we shall have the Instream material.</td><td>我们今晚将会有一节短课，休息之后，我们会有殷斯翠姆资料。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, Ruburts book on the nonphysical self will sell, and shortly. Put down the initials G’s here, and let it go for now.</td><td>现在，鲁柏谈非物质自己的那本书会卖出去，而且是在不久之后。这里记下缩写ＧＳ，然后暂且放下这件事。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:46.

Perhaps it contains a list. It is colored however, perhaps with a metallic color, (pause) of silver color.</td><td>物件似乎是某种卷轴——某个卷起来的东西，像你卷起纸张那样。也许它上面有一清单。不过，它有颜色，可能是金属色，(停顿)银色。</td></tr><tr><td>A turnabout for Dr. Instream. He has changed a decision, from one decision to an opposite one. (Pause.) I believe that he should have kept to his original course.</td><td>殷斯翠姆博士的转折点。他改变了决定，从一个决定改变为另一个相反的决定。(停顿)我相信他应该维持原来的做法。</td></tr><tr><td>A roll of string. He has been tying things together. Some difficulty with his throat, or his wife’s throat, on the left side. (Long pause.)</td><td>一卷绳子。他一直把东西捆在一起。他的喉咙或他妻子的喉咙有点问题，在左侧。(长时间停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>A master lunch today. That is, a lunch which is a meeting of several people at least. The scroll object can be used vertically or horizontally.

I have the impression that the object on the stone represents a man on a horse.</td><td>一个石头的物件，有一个边缘。我相信，边缘相当锐利。(停顿)物件是长方形的，而且对石头来说，形状相当一致。(眼睛短暂睁开)它是灰色的。一个金属物体坐在它上面，尺寸可能是迷你的。我的印象是，在石头上的物体代表一个骑在一匹马上的男人。</td></tr><tr><td>The whole object may itself be in miniature. I am not sure of the miniature connection however. The object seems to have a purpose or function connected with a desk. (Pause.)</td><td>整个物件本身可能是迷你的。但我不确定这个迷你的关联。物件似乎有一个和一张桌子有关的目的或功能。(停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>It would seem too small for a paperweight. Perhaps there is a connection with a rubber stamp. (Pause.)</td><td>对于纸张来说，这似乎太小了。也许和一个橡皮图章有关联。(停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>A tie-up of sorts this evening, in which Dr. Instream was involved. (Pause.)</td><td>今天晚上一次勉强算是的合作，殷斯翠姆博士参与其中。(停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>We will have a full session Wednesday.</td><td>我们在星期三会有一节完整的课。</td></tr><tr><td>If Ruburt will begin his exercises again he will notice an immediate improvement. In any case you are quite welcome to an evening off, and I therefore give you my heartiest wishes.</td><td>如果鲁柏再次开始做他的运动，他会注意到立即的改善。无论如何，你们尽管休息一晚，不用客气，因此我向你们致上最诚挚的祝福。</td></tr><tr><td>Good night, Seth.</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 9:15. Jane was dissociated as usual. This was the second time recently that her eyes had opened while she gave experimental material; perhaps this will become more usual.)</td><td>(9:15结束。珍像往常一样出离。这是她最近第二次在给出实验资料时，眼睛已经睁开了；也许这会越来越常见。)</td></tr><tr><td>SESSION 272</td><td>第272节 鲁柏私人课</td></tr><tr><td>JUNE 29, 1966 9 PM WEDNESDAY</td><td>1966年6月29日 星期三 晚上9点</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane now felt much better. She had received a proof of the dust jacket for her ESP book today, and both of us liked it very much. Her eyes began to open almost as soon as the session began, and she was smoking. Her pace was good.)</td><td>(珍现在感觉好多了。她今天收到了ESP那本书的书衣清样，我们俩都非常喜欢。几乎这节一开始，她的眼睛就睁开了，而她在抽烟。她的速度很好。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(Good evening, Seth.)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, I am glad to see that our friend Ruburt is again spry, good-natured, and himself again.</td><td>现在，我很高兴看到我们的朋友鲁柏再度精神好、脾气好，而且又恢复他自己的本色了。</td></tr><tr><td>The book jacket is indeed one to be proud of, and the book will be a book to be proud of. There is a small matter I would like to clear up. There was no subconscious distortion on Ruburt’s part, when I told you that the nonphysical self book would sell. I am speaking of this instance only.</td><td>这个书衣确实值得骄傲，而且这本书是一本值得骄傲的书。有一件小事我想要理清一下。当我告诉你这本谈非物质自己的书卖得掉的时候，鲁柏那边并没有任何潜意识的扭曲。我讲的只是这个例子。</td></tr><tr><td>I knew that the book would be returned shortly, and this is the reason that I gave you this reassurance. In some other instances concerning the same kind of matters, some distortions did occur. These were not basically distorted passages, only partially so. I believe two poetry books will sell. One is the psychological book. Now, this is undistorted, and if this does not materialize, than I am wrong, not Ruburt, for once. Qr probabilities enter in. Obviously Ruburt must send the books out, for example.</td><td>我知道这本书很快就会有回音，这就是我给你这个保证的原因。在涉及同类事项的一些其他情况下，确实发生了一些扭曲。这些基本上不是扭曲的段落，只有一部分是。我相信两本诗集也会销出去。一本是心理学的书。现在，这没有被扭曲，如果这件事没有实现，那就是我错了，而不是鲁柏，仅此一次。或是可能性进来了。显然鲁柏，比方说，必须把书送出去。</td></tr><tr><td>Later in the session I will slip in a few remarks, if possible, concerning the ESP book.</td><td>这一节后面，如果可能的话，我会就ESP那本书加进几则评论。</td></tr><tr><td>I would like to devote a little time this evening to a matter that concerns Ruburt rather deeply. You may or may not include this in your official records, as you prefer.</td><td>今天晚上我想花一点时间来讨论一个与鲁柏有关的问题。你可以也可以不把它放在你的正式记录里，随你高兴。</td></tr><tr><td>This has to do with the attack made on Ruburt by your domestic cat. Several issues are involved: Ruburt’s own mood at the time, for one thing. Now. The cat senses both of your moods immediately. It is psychically very close to you both. Being a house cat, it is closed in with you. As a rule you both radiate strong constructive energy. For a short period of time, Ruburt turned his creative energy, as he knows, I believe, inward rather than outward, knotted it up, misdirected it, did not focus it properly, and turned it into destructive energy.</td><td>这和你们的家猫对钱所做的攻击有关。其中牵涉到几个问题：一方面是，鲁柏自己在当时有心情。现在。猫立刻感觉到你们两人的心情。在心灵上，它和你们两人非常亲近。身为家猫，它和你们关在一起。一般来说，你们两人都散发出强大的建设能量。在一段很短的时间内，鲁柏把他的创造力，像他自己知道那样，我相信，转向内在而不是外在，让它打了结，误导它，没有正确地集中它的焦点，而把它变成破坏能量。</td></tr><tr><td>Now all energy you see is creative energy, and constructive. When it is not properly used it backs up so to speak, and explodes or erupts in what seems to be a destructive manner. This is what happened, to some degree.</td><td>现在，你看，所有能量都是创造能量和建设能量。当它没有被正确使用时，可以说，它就会倒退，以一种看似破坏的方式爆炸或爆发。在某种程度上，发生的事情就是这样。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Ruburt would not turn any destructive energy loose upon you, my dear friend, for he loves you too deeply. He is too mature now to turn such destructive energy inward in a strong manner, against his own organism. He would not willfully turn such energy loose even upon an animal.</td><td>现在。鲁柏不会把任何破坏能量发泄在你身上，因为他太深爱你了，我亲爱的朋友。他现在太成熟了，以至于他以一种强烈的方式把这样一股破坏能量转向他自己的有机体。他甚至不会故意把这样一股能量发泄在一只动物身上。</td></tr><tr><td>Usually his aggressive feelings are automatically sublimated into his work. He grapples with ideas and with words. The destructive energy however found no outlet. It therefore took the point of least resistance, and he quite subconsciously of course projected it upon his pet. It was not that he actually focused the energy purposely upon the cat, merely that the cat’s spongelike psychic nature received it full force.</td><td>通常他的攻击感会自动升华，变成他的作品。他与思想和文字搏斗。然而，破坏能量找不到任何出口。因此，它选了阻力最小的点，他当然很大部分在潜意识里把它投射到他的宠物身上。倒不是说他实际上故意把能量集中在猫身上，而只是说，猫有如海绵般的心灵本质照单全收了。</td></tr><tr><td>At the same time the animal was denied the usual constructive psychic atmosphere in which it usually is allowed to operate. The situation in the bedroom was not important in itself. The cat was nervous, bewildered and somewhat frightened however to begin with. The situation was simply the point at which the cat, in self-defense, threw back the destructive energy which it had received, and I must say in fury and full measure, and in the only way it knew.</td><td>与此同时，动物无法享有平常的建设性心灵气候，而它通常是被容许在其中运作的。卧室的情况本身并不重要。无论如何，这只猫一开始很紧张，不知所指，也有点害怕。这种情况只不过是猫在自我防卫时，甩掉它接收到的破坏能量那一刻而已，而且我必须说，是以愤怒又火力全开的方式，它唯一知道的方式就是甩掉那股能量。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, the other smaller episodes involving Ruburt and the cat alone have always occurred during the same process, only when lesser emotional crises were involved. You were quite right in saying that Ruburt fears violence. This is one of the keynotes of his personality, and rather obviously this has to do with his early life and his mother.</td><td>现在，其他只涉及鲁柏和猫而且比较小的状况一直都发生在同一个过程中，只不过是在情绪危机比较小的时候。你说鲁柏恐惧暴力是完全正确的。这是他的人格基调之一，显然这和他早年的生活以及他的母亲有关。</td></tr><tr><td>There is much more here. However he began his creative life very early as an outlet, you see, for aggressive and violent feelings. As an infant and a young child he had a strong temper, which terrified him, and he indulged in childish tantrums. Children know much more than they are given credit for. Is your hand tired?</td><td>这里还有非常多资料。不管怎样，他很早就开始把他的创作生活当作一个出口，你看，来宣泄攻击和暴力的感觉。当他是婴儿和小孩的时候，他的脾气很大，这让他感到害怕，而且他放任自己幼稚地使性子。小孩子知道的远比人们以为的还要多很多?</td></tr><tr><td>("No.”)</td><td>(“不累。”)</td></tr><tr><td>The child even then realized that violence and aggression was somehow connected with his mother’s illness. He also, that is Ruburt also, felt the violence that is a part of his father’s personality. Suddenly the tantrums ceased. He held them back in pure terror of the consequences, for suddenly the violent-tempered mother was immobile. He feared the same fate. The father had completely disappeared. To the child the father simply vanished from the face of the earth, an equally fearful fate.</td><td>孩子甚至当时就明白暴力和攻击性在某种程度上与他母亲的病有关。他也，就是鲁柏也感觉这暴力属于他父亲人格的一部分。突然间，不发脾气了。在害怕后果的纯粹恐惧中，他挡住这些脾气，因为脾气火暴的母亲突然不良于行了。他害怕遭遇同样的命运。父亲完全消失了。对于孩子来说，父亲简直就是从地球表面消失了，一样可怕的命运。</td></tr><tr><td>The child took all this as the punishment for violence. The mother now could no longer be violent in act. Not only that, but she was helpless to resist violence. This made the child hold back the most natural of aggressive feelings. In most cases the child can slap the parent. It may be slapped back, but it knows the slap will not really kill the parent. It is pretend.</td><td>孩子把这一切当作是对暴力的惩罚。现在母亲再也无法行使暴力了。不仅如此，她也无法抗拒暴力。孩子因此压抑最自然的攻击性感觉。在大多数情况下，孩子可以拍打母亲。他可能会被打回来，但他知道拍打不会真的杀死母亲。他假想着。</td></tr><tr><td>In this case the child did not dare slap the parent, for even the slightest move upon the mother’s bed, the slightest most unintentional motion, made the mother cry out in pain. Not only unintentional violence then of the simplest kind, had to be avoided, but the unintentional motion and the thoughtless childish move. This was aggravated because when the mother became frightened she pleaded with the child to sleep with her.</td><td>在这个情况下，孩子不敢拍打母亲，因为即使在母亲的床上最轻微的移动，最轻微、最无心的动作，都会让母亲痛到哭了起来。当时不仅最单纯的一种无心的暴力，都必须避免，连孩子无心的动作和不经思考的行动也是。这种情况之所以更加严重，是因为当母亲受到惊吓时，她就会恳求孩子和她一起睡觉。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, the quick nervous turning of the child upon the bed bought instant cries of anger and of abuse. We are getting this material through very well, and it is important. However I will give you a break for the sake of your faithful hand.</td><td>再一次，孩子在床上紧张地快速转动，引来的是立即大声冲口而出的愤怒和辱骂。我们非常顺利把这个资料传过来，它很重要。但是，为了你那忠心耿耿的手，我要让你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:32. Jane was as well dissociated, she said, as she has ever been: “He had me so that I was more him than me... Now, how did he do that?" She could have been talking about a stranger, she continued, yet knew what she was saying and that she talked about herself.</td><td>(9:32休息。珍说，她和以往一样完全出离了：“是他让我这样子的，如此一来我就比较是他而不是我……现在，他是怎么做到的？”她继续说，她本来可能是在谈论一个陌生人，却又知道自己在说什么，也知道她谈论的是自己。</td></tr><tr><td>(She resumed in the same very active manner, her eyes open about all of the time, at 9:42.)</td><td>(9:42分，她以同样非常活泼的方式继续，她的眼睛从头到尾差不多都是睁开的。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. It has always been extremely difficult for him to defend himself physically. As a child he simply would not do so, and to make matters worse the mother taunted him for being a coward.</td><td>现在。在身体上捍卫自己，对他来说一直是极度困难的事。身为一个孩子，他根本不会这样做，更糟糕的是，母亲还嘲笑他是个胆小鬼。</td></tr><tr><td>That he finally defended himself against her, defended himself against her emotionally and psychically, is all the more astounding. The main reason that he does not see her is not because he fears her, but because he fears the violence in himself that he has never dared direct toward her.</td><td>他终于捍卫自己而反抗她，在情绪上和心灵上捍卫自己而反抗她，这更是令人震惊。他没有看到她，主要原因不是因为他怕她，而是因为他怕他自己的暴力，他从来不敢直接面对她。</td></tr><tr><td>He projects it so that it seems to originate in the mother. At the same time the mother experiences unrecognized feelings of violence against the daughter, that sh£ has never been able to express in physical terms.</td><td>他投射它，这样一来它似乎是源自于母亲。同时，母亲体验到针对女儿被忽略的暴力感受，而且她一直都没有能力借由身体表达过。</td></tr><tr><td>She did express this violence, and again with fury, through verbal attacks to which Ruburt was extremely sensitive. But Ruburt did not even dare to express his violence verbally, because of the parent-child relationship. Added to this was the fact that the child loved the parent much more strongly, you see, than the parent ever loved the child.</td><td>她确实表达过这种暴力，而且再一次在愤怒中，透过鲁柏极为敏感的言语攻击来表达。但是，由于是亲子关系，所以鲁柏甚至在口头上都不敢表达他的暴力。除此之外，还有一个事实是，孩子爱母亲的强烈程度，远远超过母亲对孩子曾有过的爱。</td></tr><tr><td>Now symbolically any attack upon Ruburt becomes an attack by the parent, against which the child in Ruburt dares not retaliate. Flight becomes the only answer, the only sure solution, as flight from the parent was the only solution, for the parent could not run after.</td><td>现在，在象征意义上，对鲁柏的任何攻击都会变成母亲的攻击，在鲁柏里面的这个孩子不敢对此进行报复。逃离成了唯一的答案，唯一可靠的解决方案，正如逃离母亲是唯一的解决方案，因为母亲无法追赶。</td></tr><tr><td>The cat therefore was allowed to chase our friend through the apartment. Beside the rather ordinary humiliation, there was the deep bewilderment, you see, for this was the first time, symbolically, that the parent could pursue physically. If it were not for these early connections Ruburt would not have been so panic-stricken.</td><td>因此，猫被允许追着我们的朋友满公寓跑。除了相当平常的羞辱之外，还有深深的困惑，你知道，因为这是第一次，在象征意义上，母亲可以用身体追逐。如果不是因为这些早期的连结，鲁柏就不会那么惊慌失措了。</td></tr><tr><td>I am trying to explain this rather thoroughly, for once he realizes these connections he will not need to fear this quite human and natural aggressiveness. It only turns into violence, and into a fear of violence, when it is so meticulously denied.</td><td>我试图鉅细靡遗地解释这一点，因为一旦他意识到这些连结，他就不需要恐惧这种相当人性而且自然的攻击性了。只有在如此精心地否定它时，它才会变成暴力，变成对暴力的恐惧。</td></tr><tr><td>With the particular cat episode, we have something else. The mother had an absolute terror of cats, and considered them the personification of evil. She used the cat symbol as the symbol for her own mother-in-law. She was extremely unbalanced, the mother, emotionally, and considered her husband’s mother, who was a foolishly naive, good-natured and innocent thing, as a personification of evil.</td><td>关于这只猫的事件，我们还有别的东西要说。母亲对猫有一种绝对的惧怕，而且认为它们是邪恶的化身。她把猫的象征用在她自己婆婆的象征上。她，这只母猫，在感情上极度不平衡，而且认为她丈夫的母亲，一个天真到好傻，本性善良又无辜的人是邪恶的化身。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt knew this well. He has since grown to like all animals but at the moment of the attack, you see, the cat instantly became this personification of evil to him, and again his primary concern was to flee. There was never an instant in the whole affair when he thought of striking back.</td><td>鲁柏很清楚这一点。他从那时起渐渐喜欢上所有的动物，但是在攻击发生的那一刻，你看，这只猫对他而言立即变成这个邪恶的化身，再一次，他主要关切的是逃离。在这整个事件当中，他从来没有一刻想到要反击。</td></tr><tr><td>He does not see his mother because he imagines subconsciously that he is protecting her from his own violence against her, lest after all these years it might erupt. Now this is ridiculous. This restrained violence has been excellently used for creative purposes.</td><td>他没有看到他的母亲，因为他在潜意识里想像他正在保护母亲钟爱自己对她的暴力，唯恐过了这些年之后，它可能会爆发。现在，这太荒谬了。这种克制的暴力已经被用在创造性的目的上了，而且用得非常之好。</td></tr><tr><td>It is only when a break occurs, you see, when the creative energy blocks up, that such difficulties arise. For these reasons it pains him deeply to write, even to an editor, words that are not docile.</td><td>只有在发生中断时，在创造能量阻塞时，这样的困难才会出现。由于这些原因，要写出不温顺的字句，甚至是对编辑，他都会觉得痛苦万分。</td></tr><tr><td>When he was not docile as a child there was vicious instant retaliation of a most complicated nature. There was ordinary retaliation, in that he was punished through word attacks, and through such corporal punishment as the invalid could give. But, and here Joseph we come to the real heart of the matter, the mother retaliated in the main not by a direct attack upon the child, but by causing the child to believe that its misbehavior could be, and very nearly was, going to result in the death of the mother. As any child does, the child at times wished for the parents death, and here we see the mother acting out her own death in order to punish the child.</td><td>小时候，要是他不温顺，就会立刻遭受到性质最复杂的报复。有平常的报复行为，透过言语攻击，透过病残的人能够做到的这种体罚来惩罚他。但是，这里，约瑟，我们来到这个问题的真正核心，母亲基本上不是借由直接攻击孩子进行报复，而是让这个孩子相信它的不乖可能会，而且几乎就是会，导致母亲的死亡。和任何一个孩子一样，这个孩子有时候希望母亲去死，在这里我们看到母亲为了惩罚孩子而演出她自己的死。</td></tr><tr><td>This could happen as a result of the smallest transgression, if the mother was in a particularly unstable condition. When the death was not acted out in drama form—this you are familiar with, we shall not go into it here—then instead the mother pretended to have an attack of one kind or another, and she told the child that the child was directly responsible.</td><td>如果母亲处于一个特别不稳定的状态中，最小的过失就可能造成这样的结果。如果没有以戏剧形式演出死亡——这你是熟悉的，我们这里就不讨论了——那么母亲就会假装有这种或那种类型的攻击，而且她告诉孩子，孩子就是罪魁祸首。</td></tr><tr><td>The child therefore until its teens dared not be anything but docile. The personality was a strong one however, and the rebellion found no outlet except for creativity. Now the present personality suffers pangs of remorse over the slightest imagined wrong it may do to another.</td><td>因此，孩子一直到10几岁了，还是除了乖乖听话以外，什么都不敢。然而，这个人格是强大的，除了创造力之外，叛逆找不到任何出口。现在，目前的人格为了想像它可能带给另一个人而遭受一阵阵的悔恨之苦。</td></tr><tr><td>When this builds up and enough small legitimate injustices are borne, docilely, then we have an explosion of a sorts. Everyone else you see has a right to gripe, he feels subconsciously, but he cannot. He is terrified to do so. When he manages to do so he is jubilant out of all proportion. His swearing you see allows him leeway.</td><td>日积月累之下，再加上温顺地忍受够多小小的、合理的不公正对话，然后我们就有了某一种的爆炸。你看，他在潜意识里感觉到，其他每个人都有权利发牢骚，他却不行。他很害怕这么做。当他想办法这么做的时候，他欢欣鼓舞到无以复加的程度。你看，他的咒骂给了他余地。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I suggest your break.</td><td>现在我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:10. Jane was again very well dissociated. She said she could feel herself begin to protest when Seth got to the part concerning her mother's pretending of death, but Seth led her over the rough spots well.</td><td>(10:10休息。珍再一次完全出离。她说，当赛斯说到她母亲假装死亡的部分时，她可以感觉自己开始抗议，但赛斯顺利带领她渡过难关。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same manner again at 10:19.)</td><td>(10:19分，珍再次以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. We will give our Instream material this evening. However while the conditions are right I will continue. There are some issues that should be made clear. (Smile.)</td><td>现在。我们今晚会给出我们的殷斯翠姆资料。不过，在条件适合的时候，我会继续讲。有些问题应该讲清楚。(微笑)</td></tr><tr><td>Now you become, Joseph, the voice calling Ruburt a coward, you see. I am speaking of course from the viewpoint of Ruburt’s subconscious.</td><td>你看，约瑟，现在你变成骂鲁柏是胆小鬼的那个声音。我当然是从鲁柏的潜意识角度来说。</td></tr><tr><td>You grew up in an environment, my dear friend, in which violence and aggressiveness became one, were expressed in some degree by both parents. But this expression was denied to the children, and you longed to retaliate. Your father’s aggressiveness, normal male aggressiveness, was blocked up, and directed against your mother. You longed to express your natural violence, you normal aggressiveness, and you also feared to do so, and dwelled mainly in your own world.</td><td>你在一个环境中长大，我亲爱的朋友，那里暴力和攻击性合为一体，在一定程度上由父母双方把它表达出来。但是小孩子却被剥夺了这种表达，你渴望报复。你的攻击性，正常的男性攻击性受阻了，而且导向针对你的母亲。你渴望表达你的自然暴力，你正常的攻击性，但你也害怕这么做，而主要窝在你自己的世界里。</td></tr><tr><td>As a rule you do not express these feelings in the area where they would normally be expressed, and you also use them as a basis for creative work. As such they are valuable. You are twice angry at Ruburt’s lack of aggressiveness in the business world, therefore.</td><td>一般来说，你不会在这些感觉被正常表达的领域表达这些感觉，而且你也利用它们作为创意工作的基础。因此，它们很有价值。所以，你对鲁柏缺乏商业界的攻击性感到加倍愤怒。</td></tr><tr><td>All of this needs to be said, you see. You are both learning at a rather amazing rate. In the past you turned some repressed violence inward against yourself. Ruburts selling jobs were very practical for a time, for they allowed him to release aggressive feelings. You become angry when you think, rightly, that Ruburt is too docile in his dealings, but this is because you are angry at your own lack of power as a child to retaliate against the atmosphere of violence that you sensed in the child’s home.</td><td>这一切全都需要说出来，你看，你们两人正以相当惊人的速度在学习中。过去，你把一些压抑的暴力往内转向自己。鲁柏的销售工作在一段时间内非常实际，因为他得以借些释放攻击的感觉。当你合情合理地认为鲁柏做买卖太过于温顺时，你就会生气，但这是因为你对自己小时候缺少力量，无法报复你在孩子时的家中感受到的暴力气氛而感到愤怒。</td></tr><tr><td>You are also angry at Ruburt’s docility because it reminds you of your father's lack of aggression in his business dealings. When all this is out in the open as it is now, you will find that both of you can deal much more effectively with the outside business world, and you will not be hampered as you both have been.</td><td>你也气鲁柏的温顺，因为它让你想起你的父亲在商业交易中缺乏攻击性。当所有这一切像现在一样全部摊在阳光下的时候，你会发现你们两人都可以更有效地与外在的商业界打交道，而且你们不会像往常一样受到阻碍。</td></tr><tr><td>Now give us a moment please for our Instream material.</td><td>现在请给我们一点时间来处理我们的殷斯翠姆资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(Pause at 10:30. Jane sat with both hands raised to her closed eyes. This is the 76th Dr. Instream experiment.)</td><td>(10:30停顿。珍坐着，双手抬起，放在闭着的眼睛上。这是第76次的殷斯翠姆博士实验。)</td></tr><tr><td>For our object, a mirror, or something that reflects, as a very shiny surface. (Pause.) Connected with dark leather, as a belt. This could be a shiny buckle.</td><td>关于我们的物件，一面镜子或某个反射的东西，像一个非常光亮的表面。(停顿)和深色皮革有关联，像一条腰带。这可能是一个闪亮的带扣。</td></tr><tr><td>An error, discovered only recently, perhaps this week, involving a list of names.</td><td>一个错误，最近才发现的，可能是这星期，和一份清单有关。</td></tr><tr><td>The buckle, or belt, or similar object, is a gift I believe to Dr. Instream. A connection with it and a May, late May, date.</td><td>带扣、腰带或类似的物件，我相信是殷斯翠姆博士的礼物。和它以及一个5月下旬的日期有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Close by him now a small box with a miscellany of objects. (Pause at 10:35.) Perhaps the box of walnut, or there is a walnut connection here.</td><td>他现在合上一个装有各种杂物的小盒子。(10:35停顿)也许是核桃盒，或者这里与核桃有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>Four plus one equals five. This has to do with an added, or unexpected guest. Four were expected, and five arrived.</td><td>4加1等于5。这和一个新增或意料之外的访客有关联。预计有4个，但来了5个。</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have an envelope for me?</td><td>你有没有信封要给我？</td></tr><tr><td>(“No, I guess not. ")</td><td>(“不，我想没有。”)</td></tr><tr><td>We will then take a break, or you may end the session as you prefer.</td><td>那么，我们休息一下，或者你也可以结束这一节，看你比较喜欢怎样。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Well take the break.”</td><td>(“我们休息一下吧。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:36. Jane was again way-out—she had been all evening, she said. Presumably to let the emotionally charged material come through easily. Not all of it was new to us.</td><td>(10:36休息。珍再次出去很远——她说她一整个晚上都是这样。大概是要让这个充满情绪的资料容易传过来。其中一些对我们来说并非前所未闻的资料。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed, her eyes again open most of the time, at 10:45.)</td><td>(10:45分，珍继续，她的眼睛大部分时间都是睁开的。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will shortly end our session.</td><td>我们很快就结束我们的课。</td></tr><tr><td>If you read this material carefully it can benefit you more than either of you now realize. You are indeed both improving. However since the conditions were right this evening, this was the time to give you this material.</td><td>如果你仔细阅读这个资料，它对你们两人的助益会比你们现在知道的还要多。你们两人的确在提升中，但是，因为今天晚上条件合适，所以给你们这个资料正是时候。</td></tr><tr><td>l should not need to tell you, Joseph, that a rebuff or reproof by you is intensely felt by Ruburt. This does not mean of course that you should not speak your mind, merely that the fact should be taken into consideration.</td><td>我应该不需要告诉你，约瑟，鲁柏强烈感受到你的拒斥或责备。当然，这不表示你不应该说出你的想法，而是意味着你应该考虑到这个事实。</td></tr><tr><td>With what you both know now you should work out an excellent balance, you see, in your business dealings, in the same way that you have worked out an excellent balance in your creative and personal lives.</td><td>根据你们现在知道的，你应该在你的交易中，你看，找到一个很好地平衡，就像你在你的创作和个人生活中找到一个绝佳的平衡一样。</td></tr><tr><td>Now these emotional confessions of Ruburt's annoy you considerably. They are not necessary. However your annoyance can be tempered with somewhat more understanding, and this in itself will tend to minimize their occurrence. When he indulges in this sort of thing he is feeling rebellious, you see, and this is a result of the built-up aggressive feelings of which I have been speaking.</td><td>现在，鲁柏的这些情感告白让你相当恼火。它们不是必需的。然而，多一点的了解，你的不快就可以缓和下来，而这本身就会使它们的发生次数减到最少。当他沉溺于这种事情时，他会有叛逆的感觉，你看，这就是我一直在说的攻击性感受日积月累而造成的结果。</td></tr><tr><td>Subconsciously he feels that you are saying shut up, and this angers, humiliates and bewilders him. He struggles against such disclosures to begin with. Instead you see methods can be used to direct the emotions in other channels. You can get him to talk about other matters by asking for example about what he has written for the day. The subject chosen by you must be one in which he is immensely interested however. He will understand that you are merely trying to redirect him, and will not feel that you are restraining his freedom to say what he wants to say. He will understand what you are doing, but that is all right. He knows the emotional situation with your mother, and will not object.</td><td>在潜意识里，他感觉你在说闭嘴，这种愤怒既羞辱他又让他不知所措。他一开始就努力抗拒这种揭露。相反，你看，可以运用方法来把情绪引导到其他管道。你可以比方说问他当天写作的内容，引导他谈论其他事情。你选择的主题必须是他极为感兴趣的主题。他会了解你只是试着要改变他的方向，而不会觉得你是在限制他想说什么就说什么的自由。他会明白你在做什么，但那没有关系。他知道你母亲的情绪状况，而且不会反对。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I will leave you both, and I hope you will see that I have done you both a service, for this is my intention. The storm with Ruburt has passed, and you have both learned much because of it. It is a minor storm indeed, compared to what would have occurred some years earlier. He does not move furniture as erratically as he did, and is learning despite this to use his energies constructively.</td><td>现在我要离开你们两了，我希望你们能够看到我帮了你们两位一个忙，因为这就是我的意图。鲁柏的风暴过去了，你们两人因此学到了很多东西。与几年前发生的情况相比，这确实是一场小风暴。他没有像以前那样不规则地移动家具，而且尽管如此，他正在学习用建设性的方式使用他的能量。</td></tr><tr><td>The garden work is a help. It would be for you, had you the time. There are unfortunate connections with your father however, that might at first mitigate against your enjoyment, though old experience with the land would soon come back to you.</td><td>园艺工作是一个助力。这是对你来说，要是你有时间的话。然而，那些与你父亲是有一些不幸的连结，可能在一开始会减少你的乐趣，但是你和土地接触过的经验很快就会回到你身上。</td></tr><tr><td>(Reincarnation here. I believe Seth refers to my previous existence as a landowner and farmer in Denmark in the 1600s.)</td><td>(这里是讲转世。我相信赛斯指的是我在1700世纪的前世，当时我是丹麦的一个地主和农民。)</td></tr><tr><td>I repeat: Ruburt should make a daily habit of his exercises. If you have any questions I will answer them. Otherwise we shall close our session.</td><td>我再说一遍：鲁柏应该养成每天运动的习惯。如果你有任何问题，我会回答它们。否则我们就结束我们的课。</td></tr><tr><td>(“You were going to say something about the ESP book.

First however it is necessary that the nature of identity itself be studied more carefully. The nature of identity is strongly dependent upon the innate ability to draw upon, utilize and direct psychic energy.</td><td>我们很快回来谈投射的资料。首先，有必要更仔细研究本体本身的性质。本体的本质在很大程度上取决于汲取、利用和引导心灵能量的先天能力。</td></tr><tr><td>There are as I have told you no limitations to the self. It grows by growing, and by constant use of its abilities. It can be said that all consciousnesses and all identities are but one. This in no way negates the existence of any given identity however. All identities are more dependent upon each other, and yet more independent, than you imagine.</td><td>我告诉过你，自己是没有任何限制的。它透过成长，透过不断使用它的能力而增长。可以说，所有的意识和所有的本体都只是一个。然而，这绝对不会让任何既定本体的存在化为泡影。所有的本体依赖彼此的程度，以及独立的程度，都超过你的想像。</td></tr><tr><td>Various aspects of the personality exist whether or not you are aware of their existence. When you do become aware of their existence, your awareness in no way negates their independence. You simply expand psychically. Portions of the self live a more or less independent existence, both while the dominant personality sleeps and is awake.</td><td>无论你是否觉察到它们的存在，人格的各个面向都存在。当你对它们的存在有了觉知时，你的觉知绝对不会打消它们的独立。你只是在心灵上扩展而已。在支配人格睡觉时和醒时，自己的各个部分或多或少都独立存在。</td></tr><tr><td>When and if the dominant personality becomes aware of this situation, it automatically expands. It consciously contains experience that was previously subconscious. Now. The inner ego is quite familiar with the existence of the physically-oriented ego, but the physically-oriented ego is not usually familiar with its inner counterpart.</td><td>当支配人格觉察到这个情况时，它会自动扩展。它在意识上包含以前在潜意识里的经验。现在。内在自我相当熟悉身体导向自我的存在，但是身体导向的自我通常不熟悉它的内在对等物。</td></tr><tr><td>When through training the ego becomes more aware of this inner self, the whole personality benefits. The whole self as it exists at any given time can be glimpsed through studying the actions of the physically-oriented ego, as seen in physical manipulation, and in studying the activities of the inner ego as seen in dream experiences. Obviously some training is necessary before this can be achieved.</td><td>当自我经由训练而更能觉察到这个内我时，整个人格都会受益。透过研究物质导向的自我在物质操纵当中可见的行动，以及研究梦经验当中可见的内在自我的活动，就可以一瞥存在任何既定时间的全我。显然，在实现这个目标之前，必须进行一些训练。</td></tr><tr><td>Later you may be able to follow this inner self even while the physical ego operates in its normal manner, but this is much more difficult if overall personality balance is to be maintained. It should be fairly obvious that identity hardly resides exclusively within the physically-oriented ego. In one sense, identity is always a becoming, and it can never be a static, finished thing. For it knows itself through change, and that which is finished cannot change.</td><td>之后，即使物质自我以平常的方式运作，你可能也有办法追随这个内我，但是，如果要维持整体的人格平衡，这就会困难多了。很明显，本体几乎不仅仅存在于物质导向的自我之内。从某种意义来说，本体永远在变为中，它永远不会是一个静止、完成的东西。因为它透过改变来了解它自己，而已经完成的东西是不会改变的。</td></tr><tr><td>You see I would like you eventually to progress to a point where you can manipulate almost as freely within nonphysical reality as you do within physical reality. And of course be conscious or aware of the experience.</td><td>你看，我希望你最终能够进步到一个点是，你在非物质实相之内可以几乎像在物质实相之内一样自由操纵。当然要对这个经验有意识或有觉知。</td></tr><tr><td>Your own personalities will set the pace, for they are well-balanced ones. All of this demands spontaneity and control. This is the motion of consciousness. It is unfortunate that identity is considered generally as a rather static and permanent acknowledgment, for it is not.</td><td>你自己的人格将会决定速度，因为他们是很平衡的人格。这一切都需要自发性的控制力。这是意识的运动。遗憾的是，本体通常被视为一个相当静态和永久的认定，因为它不是。</td></tr><tr><td>Our material on the nature of action will be helpful here. The ego, the physically-oriented ego, is a convenient figurehead. It represents only an imperfect glimpse of a given momentary appearance—the portion of the self that happens in any given instant to show itself.</td><td>我们谈行动本质的资料在这里可以帮得上忙。自我，物质导向的自我，是一个方便的傀儡。它只代表一个既定的短暂表象不完整的一瞥——自己在任何既定的瞬间刚好露面的那个部分。</td></tr><tr><td>You do not know the self as it is within physical existence, and until you do you cannot hope to know what survives physical death, or what part of you is awake while the ego sleeps. When I refer to the ego I do so for simplicity’s sake, since the term has meaning to you. There are obviously portions of the self that never operate directly within physical reality.</td><td>你不认识在物质存在之内的自己，在你认识它之前，你无从得知在肉体死亡之后存活下来的是什么，或在自我睡着时，醒着的是你的哪一部分。当我提到自我时，我是为了简单起见才这么说，因为这个字眼对你有意义。显然，自己的某些部分永远不会在物质实相中直接运作。</td></tr><tr><td>Consider this analogy: The self as a moving circle, such as a Ferris wheel. A tree in front of the wheel will represent physical reality. The whole self, or the whole wheel, is composed of many selves in various positions, as the many people who sit on the Ferris wheel. As the wheel turns you call the person or the self who faces the tree the ego, simply because this is the portion that faces physical reality, represented by our tree. But the self who faces the tree one moment is not the self that faces it the next moment, and the operator of the wheel is never in evidence, you see.</td><td>想想这个比喻：自己是一个移动的圆圈，比如摩天轮。摩天轮前面的一棵树代表物质实相。全我，或整个摩天轮，是由很多在不同位置上的自己所组成的，就像很多坐在摩天轮上的人一样。当轮子转动时，你把面向这棵树的人或自己称为自我，只因为这部分面对我们的树所代表的物质实相。但是，这一刻面对树的自己并不是下一刻面对树的自己，而且你看，摩天轮的操作者永远不明显。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your first break.</td><td>我建议你第一次休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:30. Jane was dissociated as usual. Midway through the delivery her eyes began to open often. She resumed in the same manner at 9:40.)</td><td>(9:30休息。珍像往常一样出离。在传述过程中途，她的眼睛开始经常张开。9:40，她以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>I do not mean to imply a mechanical connection however with our analogy-</td><td>我不是故意在我们的比喻里隐含一个机械的关联。</td></tr><tr><td>The driver of our wheel in this case never appears in the seat that faces physical reality. He is in a strange position, in that he is an overall self, composed in part of the sum of these other selves, and yet more than the sum.</td><td>在这个例子当中，我们的摩天轮驾驶永远不会出现在面向物质实相的座椅上。他处于一个奇怪的位置，因为他是一个自己，一部分由其他这些自己的总和构成，但不仅仅是这个总和而已。</td></tr><tr><td>The selves who ride the wheel therefore also provide some of the power that runs the wheel. It is only because you stress similarities rather than differences that you do not realize that the self that you call the ego is but the appearance, in one particular perspective, of many quite different aspects of the personality.</td><td>因此，驾驶摩天轮的自己们也提供一些驱动轮子的力量。只是因为你强调相似之处而不是相异之处，所以你没有发觉你称之为自我的那个自己只不过是在一个特定的视角中，很多不同人格面向的表象而已。</td></tr><tr><td>Perhaps if you imagine a spotlight directed on the seat in front of the tree, you will see this more clearly. You cannot see the other selves on the wheel, you only see the one spot that is lit, and the light is that of physical perception. There are different lights, however. If others watched and saw only that portion of the self that was clear in their perspective, then they would imagine that they saw the primary self also.</td><td>也许，如果你想像一盏聚光灯针对树前方的座位，你就会更清楚地看见它。你无法看见其他在摩天轮上的自己，你只看到一个被照亮的点。这个灯光就是肉体感知的灯光。然而，有不同的灯光。如果其他人看着而且只看到在他们的视角中清晰可见的那部分自己，那么他们就会想像他们也看到了主要的自己。</td></tr><tr><td>The inner ego is the self who drives the wheel with purpose; at the same time there are many other wheels and many spokes... Our moment point analogy will also help you here. The sleeping self will of course be considered the primary self from the standpoint of its own reality. I cannot emphasize too strongly the fact that all of these portions are self-conscious. They may not be conscious of the other selves however. The inner senses connect all the selves, and the movements of consciousness are far more complicated than that of a Ferris wheel.</td><td>内在自我是带着目的驾驶摩天轮的那个自己；同时还有很多其他的摩天轮以及很多轮辐……我们的片刻点比喻在这里也可以帮上你的忙。从它自身实相的角度来看，睡着的自己当然会被认为是主要的自己。这些部分全部都是有自我意识的，我再怎么强调这个事实都不为过。然而，他们可能没有意识到其他的自己。内在感官连结所有的自己，而且意识的流动远比摩天轮的转动复杂多了。</td></tr><tr><td>You are receiving instructions, you see, now in physical reality. You are also receiving instructions in other realities. You are not aware of these consciously. Certain portions of your personalities are learning, within their own perspective, to venture into physical reality, as you are learning to venture into nonphysical reality.</td><td>你看，你现在正在物质实相之中接受训练。你也在其他实相之中接受训练。在意识上，你对这些训练是没有觉知的。你人格的某些部分在它们自己的视角之内，正在学习冒险进入物质实相，就像你正在学着冒险进入非物质实相一样。</td></tr><tr><td>Certain portions that deal rather directly with the manipulation of psychic energy are being instructed also. All of this is more complicated than it would seem, and yet extremely simple when the basic principles are understood.</td><td>某些与心灵能量的操纵直接相关的部分也正在接受训练。这一切比表面看来还要复杂，但是一旦了解基本原则，却非常简单。</td></tr><tr><td>The psychology of personality cannot be grasped unless reincarnation is taken into consideration, but even then this only represents energy operating within one system. The personality operates simultaneously within many systems. Projection represents practical application. Such experience allows you to unite various aspects of the self, and to bring the whole self into sharper focus. As a rule projection in some areas can only be achieved by those who are living their last earthly cycle.</td><td>除非把转世考虑在内，否则无法理解人格的心理，但是即便如此，这也只代表在一个系统之内运作的能量而已。人格在很多系统之内同时运作。投射相当于实际的应用。这样的经验让你能够统合自己的各个面向，把全我带入更清晰的焦点之中。一般来说，在某些领域的投射只有那些正在度过他们最后一次地球周期的人才办得到。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:00. Jane was again out as usual. Her eyes had been open most of the time. Her manner had been active, she had smoked, sipped wine, etc. Resume at 10:08.)</td><td>(10:00休息。珍像往常一样出去。大部分时间她的眼睛一直开着。她的态度很活泼，她抽了烟，喝了酒等等。10:08分继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>It is true that the whole personality, or whole self, does not directly manifest itself within physical reality.</td><td>没错，整个人格或全我并不是直接在物质实相之内显现。</td></tr><tr><td>However, the personality as it is manifested can never be understood if it is taken alone. There are sufficient hints and signs that do appear, to give evidence of these other portions of the self. Now there is one important point in particular in all this that should be emphasized, and I will repeat it: Certain portions of the self do not manifest themselves directly within physical reality. They do not operate directly within physical reality, and the word directly is significant.</td><td>然而，如果光看它而已，永远也无法了解显现的人格。的确有足够的提示迹象出现，为自己的这些其他部分提供证据。现在在这一切当中，有一个重点应该要特别强调一下，我要再说一遍；自己的某些部分并不直接在物质实相之内显现。它们并不是直接在物质实相之内运作，直接这个字眼极为重要。</td></tr><tr><td>They do not on their own perceive physical objects as such. We will refer to this later, for it will help you understand the ways in which so-called extrasensory perceptions are utilized, both on a conscious and a subconscious basis.</td><td>它们不是自己感知实际物体。我们稍后会提到这一点，因为它会帮助你了解所谓的超感官知觉的使用方式，无论是在意识还是潜意识上。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, do you have an envelope for me, Joseph?</td><td>好，约瑟，你有没有信封要给我？</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes.

The zip code number for instance for Middle Grove is 12850.</td><td>(我们认为上面的资料也发展成下一个:“而且和表示音符的记号有关联。一个音符，你知道。”再次使用自由联想——“这是要把我们引导到音符这个字眼上。”[译注：便条和音符的英文都是note。]如上所述，珍记得她母亲送给她的毛衣附上了一张便条。但我们找不到这张便条。珍相信便条实际上就是写在生日卡片背面的短信。我们找到了珍的母亲5月10日写的信，说要把毛衣邮寄给珍，虽然有某种关联，但我们不相信上述资料指的就是那封信。(“这里和一个集会有关联。7、3、0：也许是4，4、1、0。”我们看不到这些数字的任何关联。例如，米德格罗夫的邮递区号是12850。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Something to do with a dying out or fading away, as a score. " There is a possible connection with this data and the letter to Jane from her mother on May 10,1966. This letter too is written on a card. The front of the card contains a picture of three cherubs singing. One of them plays an accordion, the other two hold sheets of music on which the scores are clearly visible. Note the mention of music also in the data on pages 274 and 276. Besides telling Jane about the sweater, Jane's mother wrote in the May 10 letter of the death of a family friend, Father Ryan, and enclosed a news clipping account of the funeral, which was to be held shortly. Father Ryan died of leukemia and his death was expected; it could correspond to “dying out” or “fading away".</td><td>(“某个和逐渐消失或隐没有关的东西，就像乐谱。”可能和这个资料以及珍的母亲于1966年5月10日写给她的信有关。这封信也是写在一张卡片上。卡片正面有一张三个小天使唱歌的图片。其中一个弹的是手风琴，另外两个拿着乐谱，上面的总谱清晰可见。注意前面的资料也提到乐谱。除了告诉珍有这件毛衣之外，珍的母亲在5月10日的信里，也写到一位世交莱恩神父去世，不久将要举行葬礼，并附上葬礼的新闻剪报。莱恩神父死于白血病，他的死是预期中的事；它可能和“消失”或“隐没”相呼应。</td></tr><tr><td>(Fad we not found the May 10 letter we wouldn't have thought of the connections immediately above; even as it is I would hesitate to claim them without further data from Seth. Jane thinks they are legitimate.</td><td>(要是没有找到5月10日的信，我们就不会立刻想到上面的关联；即使是这样子，没有赛斯进一步的资料，我也会犹豫要不要把它们说出来。珍认为它们是合理的。</td></tr><tr><td>( I asked Seth three questions, asking for elaboration on color, the country connection and the nurse, or nursing. His answers merely reaffirmed the original data. See page 275.</td><td>(我问了赛斯3个问题，要求他详述颜色、乡下的关联和护士或看护。他的回答只是重申原本的资料而已。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in a quiet manner at 10:52.)</td><td>(10:52分，珍以安静的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>We are endeavoring to keep the sessions within a convenient time schedule.</td><td>我们正在努力把课安排在方便的时间表之内。</td></tr><tr><td>The package however did refer to the sweater. The box was wrapped in a layer of brown paper tied with a red ribbon; the whole then inserted into another box, a commercial box from a store, in which a nightgown had once been placed.</td><td>无论如何，包裹确实是指毛衣。盒子里用一层牛皮纸包着，系上一条红缎带；然后整个塞进另一个盒子里，一间商店的一个商用包装盒，本来里面放的是一件睡袍。</td></tr><tr><td>There was a note. The small cube referred to a small golden square of sachet, which was originally in the box but not sent to Ruburt.</td><td>有一张便条。小方块是指一个金色的正方形小袋子，最初放在盒子里，但没有寄给鲁柏。</td></tr><tr><td>We will end the session, and I look forward to our next.

This wasn't her really strong voice by any means, yet it echoed from the living room walls; this effect I believe was accentuated because we had taken the rug up from the floor for the summer. But the voice was a good one, the best in many sessions. The windows were open and it easily rose above traffic sounds, etc.</td><td>(当课程开始的时候，珍的声音变得很大声而且比往常更加低沉。不管怎么说，这都不是她最强的声音，但它却在客厅的墙壁上回响；我相信这种效果更为突出，是因为我们夏天把地毯从地板上卷起来了。但声音很好，是许多课程中最好的声音。窗户打开着，这很容易引起交通噪声等等。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane's pace was average, her eyes closed. She was also smoking, and her eyes, exceptionally dark, began to open after a few paragraphs. The session is quite unusual in two respects, as will be seen.)</td><td>(珍的节奏平稳，闭着眼睛，她在吸烟，眼睛特别黑，几段以后，开始睁开眼睛。正如我们将看到的，这节课在两个方面非常不同寻常。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now, good evening.</td><td>现在，晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>Before we speak any further about projections, the structure of the self must be more thoroughly discussed.</td><td>在我们进一步谈论投射之前，必须更彻底讨论一下自己的结构。</td></tr><tr><td>Its composition is not easy to explain in your terms. At your end there are strong chemical and electromagnetic connections that you do not understand. These in large measure help form the physically oriented ego, or at least form its characteristic manner.</td><td>用你们的说法解释它的成分并不容易。在你那一边，你有强大化学和电磁连结，但你并不了解。这些连结在很大程度上帮忙形成物质导向的自我，或至少形成它特有的方式。</td></tr><tr><td>Without these chemical and electromagnetic connections, (voice louder) the ego as such would not exist. The ego is largely dependent upon the physical mechanisms that compose the corporal image. It has its beginnings with corporal birth. While we speak of the ego, this part of the self is hardly permanent or constant, but ever-changing. However the intellect is also a portion, or an attribute, of the ego.</td><td>没有这些化学和电磁的连结，(声音更响亮)这样的自我就不会存在。自我在很大程度上依赖着构成肉体意象的物质机制(physical mechanisms)。它始于肉体的诞生。当我们谈到这个自我的时候，这一部分的自己根本不是永久或不变的，而是不断变化的。然而，智力也是自我的一个部分或属性。</td></tr><tr><td>Obviously the ego is a part of the whole self. Directly its experiences must be physically oriented, and vet with training it can also learn to appreciate realities that are not physical. It must not be pushed, but with the proper attitudes it can and must participate to some extent in all psychic experiences, if the overall stability is to be maintained.</td><td>显然，自我是全我的一部分。直接来说，它的经验必须物质导向，可以透过训练，它也可以学会欣赏非物质的实相。不能逼近它，但是，如果维持住整体的稳定，在态度正确的情况下，它可以也必须在某种程度上参与所有的心灵经验。</td></tr><tr><td>Now where the ego operates you will always find chemical repercussions; to some extent or another then the physical body will be involved. Deeper or less familiar portions of the self exist without a chemical manifestation. These usually take electromagnetic forms to some degree however.</td><td>现在，在自我运作的地方，你总会发现化学反应；所以在某种程度上，肉体也参与其中。在自己当中更深或比较不熟悉的部分是存在的，但不会具体显现在化学上。然而，这些在某种程度上通常都采用电磁形式。</td></tr><tr><td>Now certain chemical changes must come about in the physical organism before projection can occur. Were it not for these you would still be imprisoned within the corporeal image. You know that dreaming has definite chemical bases, that chemicals built up during periods of waking existence are released through dreams. Not only are they released but they form a propelling action that allows energy to flow in the opposite direction. As chemical reactions allow the body to utilize energy and form physical materializations, so the excess built up then becomes a propelling force, allowing action to flow in what you would term subjective directions.</td><td>现在，在投射得以发生之前，物质有机体必须发生某些化学变化。如果不是这些化学变化，你依然会被囚禁在肉体意象之内。你知道做梦有明确的化学基础，在醒时的化学物质透过梦而释放出来。它们不仅被释放，还形成一个推进的行动，使能量得以往反方向流动。就像化学反应让身体得以利用能量并形成物质的显化，同样地，积聚过多的能量也会变成一股推动力，使行动能够朝你所谓的主观方向流动。</td></tr><tr><td>Now this same chemical reaction must also occur, only more strongly, before a legitimate projection of the self from the physical organism can occur.</td><td>现在，自己要从物质有机体进行一次真正的投射之前，同样的化学反应也必须先发生，只不过更强烈。</td></tr><tr><td>This is one of the main reasons why such projections happen rarely. Usually, and without training, the chemical excess is used in the dreaming process. In periods of exuberant energy and well-being a more than normal amount of excess accumulates. This can trigger a projection.</td><td>为什么这样的投射很少发生，这就是主要原因之一。通常，在没有训练的情况下，过剩的化学物质会被用在做梦过程。在能量旺盛和身心健康的时期，多余化学物质就会积累到超过正常量。这可能就会触发投射。</td></tr><tr><td>Also in periods of momentary indisposition however, the dreaming process may be blocked and the chemical excess accumulated. Again, a good time to try projections.</td><td>此外，在暂时不适的时期，做梦过程可能会被阻挡，而积累过多化学物质。再一次，又是尝试投射的好时机。</td></tr><tr><td>These chemical excesses are a natural byproduct of consciousness that is bound up in physical materialization. The more intense the characteristic experience of reality, the greater the chemical excess that is built up. Consciousness itself, when physically oriented, burns up chemicals. The more intense the individual the hotter the fire, so to speak, and the greater the chemical excesses that must be released.</td><td>这些多余的化学物质是意识的一个自然副产品，与物质显化有关。实相的特有体验越深刻，多余的化学物质就会积累越多。当意识本身是物质导向的时候，它就会燃烧掉化学物质。个体越是热切，可以说，这把火就烧得越热，必须释放的多余化学物质也就越多。</td></tr><tr><td>Released they must be, or the organism would not survive. Periods of intense activity may also then generate this additional chemical propellant. Now. Although this necessary chemical fuel is generated through intense activity of a mental or psychic nature, it is released, making projections possible in alternating periods of quietude and rest.</td><td>一定要释放它们，不然有机体无法存活。激烈的活动期间也可能产生这种额外的化学推进物。现在。尽管这种必要的化学燃料是经由心智或心灵的激烈活动而产生的，但它被释放出来，使得投射能够在安静和休息的交替期间进行。</td></tr><tr><td>Is your hand tired?</td><td>你的手累了吗?</td></tr><tr><td>("No.”</td><td>(“不累。”</td></tr><tr><td>(It was 9:29. Jane did not take a break. Her delivery was by now very animated and her eyes had begun opening often. The voice was just as strong as before, showing no signs of fatigue. Occasionally Jane sipped some wine and smoked a cigarette.)</td><td>(现在是9:29。珍没有休息。她的传述到此刻为止非常活泼，而且眼睛开始经常睁开。声音和以前一样有力，没有任何疲倦的迹象。珍偶尔喝一点洒、抽一支烟。)</td></tr><tr><td>There must be a disciplined focus of this propellant therefore, if projection is to be achieved. Now. Periods of heightened sexual activity of a strong and deep nature will help. However, periods of no sexual activity will also help. On the one hand the chemical excess is built up as a result of over intensity. On the other hand, and in the latter case, it is built up because psychic and sexual release has not been granted. Eggs and asparagus are helpful.</td><td>因此，如果要达成投射，必须要自律地聚焦在这个推进物上。现在。本质强烈又深刻的性活动增加的时期是有帮助的。但是，没有性活动的时期也有帮助。一方面，过剩的化学物质之所以积累，是因为过激的结果。另一方面，而且在后面的情况下，它之所以日积月累，是因为心灵方面和性方面没有得到释放。蛋和芦笋是有帮助的。</td></tr><tr><td>I am obviously not suggesting a whole diet composed of eggs and asparagus. These plus fish oils are beneficial however, but not when taken with acid foods. Periods of especially intense psychic and Mental activity can help you achieve projections. Periods of very little, unusually sparse, mental and psychic periods are often apt to result in projections—also however for the same reasons given concerning sexual activity.</td><td>我在建议的是一套由蛋和芦笋组成的饮食法。不过，这些加上鱼油是有益的，但是和酸性食物一起食用就不是。特别激烈的心灵和心智活动时期可以帮助你达成投射。心智和心灵活动非常少、少到不寻常的日期往往容易引发投射——但是基于那些和性活动有关的相同原因，也是如此。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I am speaking not only of legitimate projections, but of projections vivid enough to be recalled and recorded. Projections in other words in which the ego can take at least some small part. Spontaneous projections of which you are not aware occur frequently.</td><td>现在，我在讲的不只是真正的投射，还有生动到能够记得和记录下来的投射。换句话说，自我至少能够参与一小部分的那些投射。你毫无知觉的自发投射经常发生。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest a more thorough examination of your dreams here, for many of them contain such spontaneous projections. They are most apt to occur in the early hours, between 3 and 3 A.M. The body temperature drops at such times. Five in the afternoon is also beneficial from this standpoint. The drinking of pure water also facilitates projection, although lor obvious reasons the bladder must be empty.</td><td>这里我建议对你更彻底检视你的梦，因为其中很多都包含这样的自发投射。它们最容易发生在凌晨3点到5点之间。在这个时候体温下降。从这个角度来看，下午5点也是有利的。饮用纯水也有助于投射，但膀胱必须是空的，原因显而易见。</td></tr><tr><td>The north-south position is extremely important in this context, and indeed a necessity for any efficient dream records. The reasoning parts of the brain can work most efficiently along with the intuitive portions of the self when the physical organism is in that position.</td><td>在这个背景下，南北向的位置极为重要，而且确实是任何有效梦记录的一个必要条件。当物质有机体处于这个位置时，大脑的推理部位就能够与自己的直觉部分非常有效率地一起工作。</td></tr><tr><td>Joseph, if your hand is tired we shall break.</td><td>约瑟，如果你的手累了，我们就休息。</td></tr><tr><td>("Okay.”</td><td>(“好。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane stopped speaking at 9:42 but did not come out of trance. This is the first such instance in the sessions. Her manner had been very active, her eyes open often, her voice strong. Now she sat without moving perceptibly, her eyes closed, for two minutes. I got up and moved around, then sat down again.</td><td>(珍9:42停止说话，但没有脱离出神状态。这是课间第一次有这样的情形。她的态度非常活泼，眼睛经常睁开，声音有力。现在她坐着不动，眼睛闭着，持续两分钟。我起身四处走动，然后又坐下来。</td></tr><tr><td>("I’m ready now. "At 9:44.)</td><td>(“我现在准备好了。”9:44。)</td></tr><tr><td>The whole organism operates more effectively, generally speaking, in such a position, but more than this, the whole self operates more as a single unit. The intellectual processes are to some extent diminished in other positions. This has to do as I have said with electromagnetic properties.</td><td>一般而言，整个有机体在这样的位置上比较能够有效运作，但更重要的是，全我更能够以一个单元的形式运作。心智历程在其他位置上会缩减到某种程度。这与我说的电磁属性有关。</td></tr><tr><td>In other positions it is the ego and intellect that suffer most, and since our purpose is to enlighten them as much as possible, this is not to our advantage.</td><td>在其他位置上，自负和理智吃的苦头最多，由于我们的目的是尽可能启发它们，所以这对我们不利。</td></tr><tr><td>Energy is most easily utilized in this position, for one thing, and this cuts unnecessary restrictions to a minimum. There is a vast difference between ordinary dreams and projections, whether or not the projections occur from the dream threshold. Dreams are constructed and sent upon their way. As you know, they maintain an independence within their own dimension.</td><td>首先，在这个位置上，能量最容易被利用，而且这会把不必要的限制减到最低。普通梦和投射之间存在着巨大的差异，无论投射是不是始于梦起点。梦被建构并且被送上路。如你所知，它们在它们自己的维度之内保有独立。</td></tr><tr><td>Projections involve many more aspects of the whole self, and are a mark that the personality is progressing in important ways. The inner senses are allowed their greatest freedom in projection states, and the whole self retains experience that it would not otherwise. When this knowledge becomes part of the usual waking consciousness, that is when you realize what you have done, then you have taken a gigantic step forward.</td><td>投射涉及全我的面向还有很多，是人格在许多重要方面正进步中的一个标记。内在感官在投射状态中得以拥有最大的自由，而且全我获得其他情况下无法获得的经验。当这个知识变成平常醒时意识的一部分时，也就是说，当你发觉你所做的事时，你就已经往前迈出巨大的一步。</td></tr><tr><td>An almost automatic determination must be set up however if projections with conscious awareness are to be anything but rare oddities. With you both the problem is somewhat different than it might be with others. These chemical excesses are used up for one thing in your own creative work. You do this now automatically.</td><td>如果带着意识觉知的投射不会什么都不是，而仅仅只是罕见的怪事，那就必须下定一个几乎是自动的决心。比起在其他人身上，这个问题在你们两人身上稍微有点不一样。这些多余的化学物质首先被用在你自己的创作上。你现在是自动这么做。</td></tr><tr><td>It goes without saying that your work will gain immeasurably through the extended experience of projections. The yoga exercises allow you, when they are faithfully executed, to draw an abundance, indeed a superabundance, of energy. This energy results also in chemical excesses that can be utilized in projections without drawing away energy for your work.</td><td>不用说也知道，透过扩展的投射经验，你的工作将会得到无法估量的收获。要是确实执行的话，瑜珈练习让你能够汲取丰富的，确切地说是超级丰富的能量。这股能量也会造成化学物质过剩，投射可以利用这些多余的化学物质，而不会消耗掉你创作所需的能量。</td></tr><tr><td>The expectation and the knowledge that you are part of all energy will allow you to realize that all the energy you require will be given, since you are part of it. Only your own attitude, only any mans attitude, limits the amount of energy at his command.</td><td>预期并且认识你是所有能量的一部分，你就能够明白，你会得到你需要的所有能量，因为你是它的一部分。只有你自己的态度，只有任何人的态度，才会限制它自由支配的能量。</td></tr><tr><td>I find myself trying to instruct you both again in the true nature of practicality.</td><td>我发现我自己又试着按照实用性的本质来指导你们两人。</td></tr><tr><td>Is your hand tired?</td><td>你的手累了吗？</td></tr><tr><td>("No. “ 10:10.)</td><td>(“不累。”10:10。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your attitudes toward what is possible determines what is possible for you in very definite terms. Your attitudes create possibilities and impossibilities. Your attitude toward money creates your bank account. I am not speaking of your personally, alone. These laws apply to all. What you expect you create, and that is the beginning and end of it, whether you are speaking of psychic matters or physical matters.</td><td>你对什么是可能的所抱持的态度，非常明确地决定了什么对你来说是可能的。你的态度创造了可能与不可能。你对金钱的态度创造了你的银行户头。我在说的不只是你的人格而已。这些法则适用于所有人。你预期什么，你就创造什么，无论你在谈的是心灵问题还是物质问题，这就是它的开始也是结束。</td></tr><tr><td>Until you learn this you learn little, and until you learn this you do not know what it means to be practical. If you did not think projection was possible for you, you would never achieve a projection. You create your reality, and no one else can create it for you.</td><td>在你学到这一点之前，你学到的东西很少，在你学到这一点之前，你不知道所谓实际是什么意思。如果你认为投射对你而说是不可能的，你永远也不可能达成投射。你创造你的实相，没有人能够为你创造它。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. There are definite chemical changes during projections. There are also electromagnetic changes that can be perceived with instruments. Certain electrical fields will also make themselves known under these conditions. The fields have always existed but they will only become apparent to physical instruments when they are being crossed. In other words, at the very act of projection.</td><td>现在。在投射期间有明确的化学变化。也有可以用仪器感知的电磁变化。在这些状况下，某些电场也会自行表露。这些场域一直都存在，但只有在它们被跨越时，换句话说，也就是正在投射时，它们才会显露在物理仪器之前。</td></tr><tr><td>The mirror in your bedroom is an excellent aid, incidentally. Certain temperature variations are also helpful. A cool body temperature for example, and the outside temperature, or rather the room temperature, between 73.8 and 75.9 or .10. High humidity is poor.</td><td>顺便提一下，你们卧室里的镜子是一个绝佳的辅助用具。某些温度变化也很有帮助。例如，偏凉的体温、室外温度，或室温在23.2℃至24.3到9℃之间。湿度高很不利。</td></tr><tr><td>The color of a room is important. Your room, the bedroom, is a good color for this purpose. Cool colors are best. Too-warm colors are detrimental, being too closely allied with earthly aspects. For various reasons in your particular climate, May, October, February, March, are best. August sac be beneficial according to the weather. Also September, April at times. Too-warm weather is detrimental.</td><td>房间的颜色很重要。你们的房间，卧室，对这个目的来说，颜色很适合。冷色调是最好的。太暖的颜色是不利的，和地球的种种面向太过于紧密相连了。由于各种原因，在你们的特定气候中，5月、10月、2月、3月是最好的。8月可能是有利的，要看天气而定。有时候9月、4月也是。太暖和的天气是不利的。</td></tr><tr><td>Now this has to do with the electrical currents about the skin, and sweat on the body. Also with saline composition of the body at various times of the year.</td><td>现在，这与皮肤周围的电流和身体上的汗水有关。也和身体在一年当中各个不同时期的盐分有关。</td></tr><tr><td>When you want a break, please say so.</td><td>当你想要休息时，请说出来。</td></tr><tr><td>(“All right, well take one now.”</td><td>(“好吧，我们现在就休息一下。”</td></tr><tr><td>(At 10:15 Jane stopped speaking once again, ad sat very quietly, as before. Her voice had been strong and clear throughout, varying little in strength through the session. Since she was still in trance I thought it voluntary, and that she must feel in excellent form this evening. Her eyes were now closed.)</td><td>(10:15，珍再次停止说话，像之前一样安静地坐着。她的声音从头到尾既有力又清晰，一整节下来在力道上变化不大。由于她仍处于出神状态，我认为这是自愿的，她今晚一定是感觉非常好。她的眼睛现在闭着。)</td></tr><tr><td>Walk about if you prefer.</td><td>如果你愿意，可以到处走走。</td></tr><tr><td>( I did, stretching. In an aside as I paced about, and as Seth, Jane assured me there was no rush to get back to notes, etc. But I was ready to resume at 10:18, and the strong voice once again boomed out.)</td><td>(我有，还伸展了一下。题外话，在我踱步的时候，身为赛斯的珍向我保证，不必急着回来写笔记等等。但是在10:18分，我准备好要继续了，这时有力的声音再一次轰然而出。)</td></tr><tr><td>These projections take a strong propelling force, for you are literally traveling from one dimension or reality to another. And yet you will retain awareness. All of this evening I have been speaking of projections in which awareness is retained, and not of more frequent projections which are usually forgotten.</td><td>这些投射有强大的推动力，因为你实际上是从一个维度或实相旅行到另一个维度。但是你还是有觉知。一整晚我都是在谈带着觉知的投射，而不是在讲通常都会被忘记的那类比较常有的投射。</td></tr><tr><td>The psychic energy necessary is considerable. It is twice as considerable when you attempt to manipulate in these seemingly alien conditions. Yet you must do so, and safely return.</td><td>必要的心灵能量是相当可观的。可观的程度比你试图在这些看似陌生的条件下进行操纵时还要高出一倍。但你必须这样做，而且安全返回。</td></tr><tr><td>We shall discuss various kinds of projections in detail, for you will become acquainted with them. Unless the structure of personality, or of the self, is clearly understood, projection itself will not seem possible. A self that is conceived of as a physical composition only would never be able to project, nor survive physical death.</td><td>我们详细讨论各种不同的投射，因为你会逐渐熟悉它们。除非清楚了解人格或自己的结构，否则投射本身似乎是不可能的。一个被想成只有物质成分的自己，永远无法投射，也无法在肉体死亡之后存活下来。</td></tr><tr><td>Through the years a history of personal projections will serve to prove to you the nonphysical aspect of the self. You may even meet me (smile, eyes open wide) in some future projection. My meetings with you here involve to some extent projections on my part and on Ruburt’s part. As yet he is not consciously aware of these projections. When I am here, he is often somewhere else. Part of him remains to keep check on me, and unfortunately this is the part that could be, but is not as yet, aware of his other surroundings.</td><td>多年来，个人投射的历史有助于向你证明，自己的非物质面相的确存在。在未来的某个投射中，你甚至可能见到我(微笑，睁大眼睛)。我和你在这里的相会在某种程度上涉及我这边和鲁柏那边的投射。到目前为止，他在意识上还没有觉察到这些投射。当我在这里时，他经常在别的地方。他的一部分仍然在监督我，不幸的是，可能但还没有对他的其他环境有觉知的，就是这个部分。</td></tr><tr><td>You often project when you are painting, and you do not know it.</td><td>你经常在绘画的时候投射，而你却不知道。</td></tr><tr><td>Now I will give you both a break.</td><td>现在我要让你们休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:29. Jane now came out of her trance for the First time since 9 PM. As far as we know this is by far the longest trance she has undergone. Nor was her emergence from it easy; she seemed to grope her way out of it slowly, eyes blinking with effort many times before they finally opened clearly. (She was, she said, “way-out,” very well dissociated indeed. She had little recollection of her surroundings while speaking, and was quite surprised to learn her eyes had been wide open much of the time. She recalled a couple of cigarettes and a sip or two of wine, but these actions were “removed” from her.</td><td>(10:29休息。从晚上9点开始，现在是珍第一次脱离她的出神状态。据我们所知，这是她到目前为止经历过最长的出神。而且回神过程也不容易；她似乎慢慢摸索，才找到路出来，因为她的眼睛最终明显睁开之前，眨了很多次。</td></tr><tr><td>(She knew, she said, at once that the voice was strong and loud. From the moment the session began she was “within the voice, "as though wrapped in a cocoon. The voice swept her along as it has on a few occasions in the past. Nor did she know she would be kept in trance during breaks to rest my writing hand. She thought Seth did this to keep the session short, yet get lots of material through. She felt a sense of strangeness at break time because she didn’t leave trance, but was not worried, nor did she try to get out of trance. Jane said she now felt quite tired.</td><td>(她说，她“出去很远”，确实是非常顺利出离。她在说话时对她周围的环境几乎毫无记忆，并且在得知她大部分时间都睁开眼睛时，她觉得相当惊讶。她记得抽了一两根烟，喝了一两口酒，但这些行动都从她身上“消除”了。(她说，她立刻知道声音既有力又响亮。从这节开始的那一刻开始，她就“在声音之内”，好像包裹着一个茧。就像过去几次一样，声音席卷了她。她也不知道在让我写字的手歇一会儿的休息期间，她仍然在出神中。她认为赛斯这样做，是为了缩短上课时间，同时又可以获得大量资料。在休息时，她有一种奇怪的感觉，因为她没有回神，但她并不担心，也没有试着脱离出神状态。珍说她现在觉得很累。</td></tr><tr><td>(The moment the session began Jane felt a great sense of confidence that she knew wasn’t hers—a sense that things were going to go extremely well. Throughout, her voice has been loud and strong, with an echoing quality engendered by our walls and the rugless floor.</td><td>(这一节开始的那一刻，珍感觉非常有自信，她知道这不是她的感觉——事情会进行得极为顺利的一种感觉。从头到尾，她的声音响亮又有力，我们的墙壁和没有地毯的地板都因此产生了回音。</td></tr><tr><td>(Although tired, Jane resumed at 10:40.)</td><td>(虽然累了，但是珍还是在10:40继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will continue this discussion at our next session.</td><td>我们将在下一节继续这个讨论。</td></tr><tr><td>Circumstances were good this evening, and I decided to take advantage of them. If you did not have to rise so early in the morning I would continue. However we do have all the time in the world, indeed.</td><td>今晚的情况很好，我决定利用它们。要是你早上不必这么早起，我会继续讲下去。不过，说真的，我们的确有一整个世界的时间。</td></tr><tr><td>My heartiest wishes to you both. You should find this evenings material helpful and instructive. As always I regret leaving you, but more than usually this evening, since I came through so well.</td><td>向你们两位致上我最衷心的祝福。你应该会发现今晚的资料很有帮助，也很有教育意义。一如既往，要离开你们，我觉得遗憾，但是今晚更是比平常舍不得，因为我过来得非常顺利。</td></tr><tr><td>I intend to outline the steps involved in the various kinds of projections for you. And now good evening.</td><td>我打算为你概述各种投射的相关步骤。现在，晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good night, Seth. ’’)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>One small point, however. You project also while you are in the waking state, but you do not realize this. Training can help you however, though this involves more work, and you will not reach that stage of realization for some time.</td><td>不过，一个小小的重点。你在醒时状态中也会投射，但你没有发觉。无论如何，训练可以帮助你，但是这要下更多工夫才行，而且要经过一段时日之后，你才能够达到发觉自己在投射的阶段。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 10:45.

Ithaca is 30. some miles northeast of Elmira.</td><td>(第64次信封实验的信封标的物是我们最近一次度假时，于1966年7月12日在纽约州伊萨卡附近的罗伯·特雷曼国家公园取得的一张停车票卡。它是用黑色印刷在卡片上，序列编号则用浅蓝色的油墨。我把它放在两块纸板之间，然后放入一般的双层信封里。伊萨卡位于埃尔迈拉以北30英里处。</td></tr><tr><td>(We visited the park three times during that week, but I kept the date for the ticket straight by attaching a penciled slip to it. As it happens some of the envelope data arises out of our two subsequent visits.

Her eyes were open from the beginning of the session, she was smoking, and her voice was average with pauses.)</td><td>(在这一节开始前，珍说她对赛斯会说些什么一点概念也没有。自从课一开始，她的眼睛一直是睁开的，她在抽烟，她的声音不急不徐，偶有停顿。)</td></tr><tr><td>Good evening.</td><td>晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。”)</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Using energy generates energy.</td><td>现在。使用能量产生能量。</td></tr><tr><td>The more creative energy you generate, the more you are able to generate. You do not use up energy in biological terms, and to think so is an error.</td><td>你产生的创造能量越多，你有能力产生的能量就越多。</td></tr><tr><td>To refrain from using energy is to have less of it. The use of energy is the basis for personality and the intensity of experience. There is no such thing as hoarding energy. The creative individual has more vivid dream experiences and more vivid waking experiences than other individuals. Creativity should not be considered as the property of those who work in the arts however, for it is not theirs exclusively.</td><td>按照生物学的说法，你不会用光能量，而且这么想是错的。克制使用能量就是减少拥有的能量。能量的使用是人格和经验强度的基础。没有囤积能量这种事情。比起其他个体，有创造力的个体拥有更生动的梦经验和更生动的醒时经验。然而，创造力不应被当成是艺术工作者的财产，因为它不是他们独有的。</td></tr><tr><td>Creativity' is an emotional and psychic characteristic. It can be used in various ways. The dreams of the highly creative exist multidimensionally. Projections rarely occur except to creative individuals. Now I am taking considerable time to deal with projections because on a spontaneous basis they occur more or less constantly.</td><td>创造力是一种情感和心灵的特征。使用它的方式很多。高度创造性的梦存在多重维度中。除了有创造力的人以外，投射很少会发生。现在我花了相当多的时间来讨论投射，因为在自发的基础上，它们或多或少持续不断发生。</td></tr><tr><td>Conscious projections— I should clear this: Projections that are conscious ones—usually occur only to highly creative individuals. Spontaneous projections however do occur constantly to every consciousness. You do not dwell within your physical universe as completely as you imagine, and as I have told you, you exist as long out of it as you do within it.</td><td>有意识的投射——我应该理清这一点：有意识的投射——通常只发生在具有高度创造力的人身上。然而，自发的投射的确不断发生在每一个意识身上。你并不是如你想像的那样完全寓居在你们的物质宇宙之内，而且我跟你说过，只要你存在它之内，你就是存在它之外。</td></tr><tr><td>This does not mean that you do not exist however in the apparent interval. Our discussion concerning the nature of matter is important here, for I explained the pulsations that occur in atoms. Your perception of time causes many difficulties when you try to examine reality as it exists independent of matter. The limitations of verbal communications make some explanations difficult. (See Volumes I and 2, for example.)</td><td>但是，这并不是说你不存在于明显的间隔(interval)之中。我们针对物质本质的讨论在这里很重要，因为我解释了发生在原子之中的脉动。当你试图检视独立存在于物质之外的实相时，你对时间的感知会造成很多困难。由于口语沟通的限制，有些很难解释。(例如，见第一册和第二册。)</td></tr><tr><td>You understand the concept of the spacious present. It appears to you of course that this room and everything within it is more or less in constant existence, between the limitations of its creation or manufacture, and death or material decay. Within the time structure of your perception, this chair for example has been in constant existence since you purchased it.</td><td>你了解广阔的现在这个概念。当然，在你看来，这个房间以及其中的每一样东西或多或少都持续存在着，介于它的创造或制造的限制以及死亡或物质衰变之间。在你感知的时间结构之内。比方说这张椅子自从你买了它以来一直都存在着。</td></tr><tr><td>I have told you that pulsations occur as energy enters into an atom and then departs from it. There is an interval in which the chair simply does not exist, but you do not perceive it. A mechanism something like an afterimage allows you to see matter as continuous.</td><td>我告诉过你，在能量进入原子，然后离开原子之时，脉动就会发生。有一个间隔，在这个间隔之中，椅子根本不存在，但你没有感知到它。类似残影的机制使你能够看到连续存在的物质。</td></tr><tr><td>Now the length of this interval would seem unbelievably brief from some perspectives or systems, and centuries long, you sec, if viewed from different systems. You yourselves do not perceive it at all. Consciously you do not perceive the intervals (smile, eyes wide open) during which you yourselves simply do not exist as material organisms.</td><td>现在，从某些视角或系统看来，这个间隔的长度似乎短暂到令人难以置信，而且如果是从不同的系统看来，你看，则有几世纪之久。你们自己根本没有感知到它。在意识上，你们没有感知到你们自己身为物质有机体根本就不存在的那些间隔。(微笑，睁大眼睛)</td></tr><tr><td>We have, again, almost a mental afterimage that gives you the illusion that one moment leads smoothly to the next. You do exist during these intervals, but you do not exist in any physical terms. It is not a matter—if you will excuse my pun—it is not a matter of the consciousness escaping from the body. It is a matter concerning the fact that no physical body exists from which to escape.</td><td>我们再一次几乎拥有一个心智残影，它给你这一刻顺利来到下一刻的幻相。在这些间隔期间，你确实存在，但是就任何物质的角度来说，你并不存在。这件事并不是——如果你能原谅我用双关语(译注：matter可以指物质，也可以指事情。因此此处谈到物质，故而用matter这个字是一语双关)——这件事并不是意识逃脱身体。这件事和一个事实有关，那就是，可以从中逃脱的肉体并不存在。</td></tr><tr><td>The consciousness exists however. The consciousness as it reasserts itself within physical reality has no memory of the interval in which it did not physically exist. The inner self however retains all memory. Dreams allow consciousness to disentangle itself from physical reality. For various reasons the intervals here, you see, are to some extent recalled.</td><td>然而，意识是存在的。在物质实相之内重新显现的并不记得它在物质上并不存在的间隔。但是，内我保留所有的记忆。梦使意识得以脱离物质实相。由于各种原因，你看，这里的间隔在某种程度上被记得。</td></tr><tr><td>A large variety of dreams are the memories of this nonphysical existence that constantly occurs, though in waking life you are seldom aware of them. This cycle that psychologists have recently discovered, having to do with the various dream levels, corresponds to the ebb and tide of consciousness as it appears within and disappears from physical reality. It creates physical reality, as you know.</td><td>各式各样的梦就是这种不断发生的非物质存在所属的记忆，只不过在醒时生活中你很少觉察到它们。心理学家最近发现的这个周期与各种梦层次有关，相当于意识出现在物质实相之内以及从物质实相消失的起起落落。如你所知，它创造了物质实相。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take your first break.</td><td>你可以休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:27. Jane had been dissociated as usual. Her eyes had been open often, pace and voice average. She resumed in the same manner at 9:35.)</td><td>(9:27休息。珍像往常一样出离，她的眼睛经常打开，速度和声音普通。9:35，她以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>There is an ebb and tide. Your consciousness is not fully focused within physical reality, even during those intervals when you exist within it. The focus varies considerably, and in certain rhythm.</td><td>有一种起起落落。你的意识并没有完全聚焦在物质实相之内。甚至是你存在其中的那些间隔期间也是如此。焦点变化相当大，而且照着某种节奏进行。</td></tr><tr><td>The amount of focus and the intensity varies according to the individual, but consciousness is never entirely focused within physical reality. Now when conscious projections occur you are taking advantage of these intervals between materializations. You may call these non intervals, actually.</td><td>焦点的数量和强度依据个体而变化，但意识从不完全聚焦在物质实相之内。现在，当有意识的投射发生时，你正在利用物质显化之间的这些间隔。其实，你可以称之为非间隔(non interval)。</td></tr><tr><td>Your idea of time does not exist within such intervals. You do not even take it with you. Now these no intervals are indeed openings into other realities, and you can theoretically explore them. They exist as actually as physical reality. You are doing the same thing when you realize you are dreaming, and decide to explore, say, a distant landscape that appears within the dream.</td><td>你的时间观念并不存在于这样的间隔之内。你甚至没有带上它。现在，这些非间隔确实是通往其他实相的门户，理论上你可以探索它们。它们与物质实相一样实际存在。当你发觉你在做梦时，你就是在做同样的事，决定探索，就说，一个出现在梦中的遥远景观。</td></tr><tr><td>You may say that these no interval experiences are subjective, but no more are they subjective than your physical life is. Theoretically you could explore these endlessly. Practically you cannot. Now in your physical life as you know it, you are indeed exploring such a non interval. Do you see?</td><td>你可以说这些非间隔经验是主观的，但它们并不比你的物质生命更主观。从理论上讲，你可以无休无止地探索这些。但在实际上你不能。现在，在你所知的物质生命中，你确实正在探索这样一个非间隔。你明白吗?</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes.”)</td><td>(“明白。”)</td></tr><tr><td>For this is a non interval to the inner self. This material is extremely important. One portion of you leaves the inner self to explore in depth a particular non interval. To the inner self no time passes. You experience of course physical time. This non interval however creates its own interval points that you also explore, in your dreams and waking projections that escape your ordinary consciousness.</td><td>因为这对内我而言是一个非间隔。这个资料非常重要。你的一部分离开了内我，去深入探索一个特定的非间隔。对内我来说，没有任何时间流逝。你当然体验了物质时间。但是，这个非间隔创造了它自己的间隔点，你也在不受你平常意识控制的梦中和醒时投射中探索这些间隔点。</td></tr><tr><td>In exploring these non intervals however (smile) you also create that which you explore, for none of this exists without creative consciousness. This evening’s material, read along with the discussions concerning the nature of action, will give you a more comprehensive idea of what I am trying to tell you.</td><td>然而，在探索这些非间隔时(微笑)，你也创造了你探索的东西，因为没有创造意识，这一切就都不存在。今晚的资料，连同有关行动本质的讨论一起读，会让你更全面了解我想告诉你的是什么。</td></tr><tr><td>This process is literally endless. The abundance of energy at your command is more vast than you suppose. Conscious projections are journeys into other non intervals, and they are extremely valuable to the whole personality.</td><td>这个过程实际上是无止境的。随你支配的能量比你以为的还要丰沛。有意识的投射是进入其他非间隔的旅程，它们对整个人格非常有价值。</td></tr><tr><td>They relieve the physical organism for one thing. They refresh it immeasurably for another. We will deal with dream projections in detail, and then we shall discuss conscious projections literally from the waking state. I will give you my directions for projections from within the dream state first.</td><td>首先，它们让物质有机体放松。其次，它们让物质有机体大幅度更新到无可计量的程度。我们会详细探讨梦投射，然后我们会讨论实际从醒时状态出发的有意识投射。我首先要给你指引的是从梦状态出发的投射。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take a break, and we shall continue.</td><td>你可以休息一下，我们再继续。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:52. Jane said she was far-out. Her pace was a bit faster, her eyes open often, etc. As Seth talked she had feelings of concepts, of things “opening up.” She felt herself rushing in various directions, she said, inspired by these concepts, then giving voice to them one by one as she reached them. She called it a process of returning.</td><td>(9:52休息。珍说她出去很远。她的速度加快了一点、她的眼睛经常睁开等等。当赛斯说话时，她有一些概念、东西“展开”的感觉。她说，她感觉自己往不同方向冲，受到这些概念的启发，然后在她冲到它们那里的时候，再一个接一个说出来。她称之为回归过程。</td></tr><tr><td>(She resumed in the same active manner at 10:00.)</td><td>(10点整，她以同样活泼的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>We have not really begun full discussions of the types and kinds and degrees of dream experiences.</td><td>我们还没有真正开始充分讨论梦经验的种类和程度。</td></tr><tr><td>Some dreams as you know are more closely allied with physical reality than others. Some however are excellent as thresholds for conscious projection. What Fox called awake-seeming dreams are excellent. These can be produced during relatively brief naps also.</td><td>你知道，有些梦与物质实相的连结比其他的梦更紧密。然而，有些则是有意识投射的绝佳起点。福克斯所谓的看似醒来的梦是非常好的跳板。这些也可以在相对短暂的小睡期间产生。</td></tr><tr><td>Our instructions will begin with the use of these dreams whenever they occur. You will know them by their intense vividness. These are dreams when at first you are certain that you are awake. It is sufficient to keep this in mind, so that in the middle of a dream you can realize what it is.</td><td>我们的训练将从利用这些梦开始，不管它们发生在何时。你从它们生动至极的样子就认得出它们。这些就是一开始你确定你醒着的梦。记住这一点就够了，这样在做梦时，你就能够发觉它是什么。</td></tr><tr><td>lbe pure and brilliant quality of the surroundings have much in common with the appearance physical reality has for children. The physical senses seem to operate with such efficiency that you think you are awake, but their brilliancy is super perfect. As soon as you realize what type of dream this is, then with practice you can project within it consciously, and explore your environment.</td><td>四周环境的纯净和明亮品质，与物质实相显现在孩童眼中的表象有很多共同之处。肉体感官的运作效率似乎如此之高，以至于你认为你是醒着的，但它们的明亮程度却是超乎完美。一旦你发觉这是什么类型的梦，那么透过练习，你就能够有意识地投射进入其中，探索你的环境。</td></tr><tr><td>Now.

The interesting bit of information here is that a deliberate effort was made to spread the blanket on a grassy spot near the picnic tables, so that a softer bed would be furnished.</td><td>(这里的两个印象都是有效的。毯子的资讯是因为大卫的关系。在他摔倒之后，从聚会的成员当中寻找毯子。最后在一辆车子里拿出一条，大卫被要求安静躺在毯子上，以便确定没有延迟的创伤出现。结果完全没有。这里一个有趣的资讯是，我们刻意把毯子铺在野餐桌附近的草地上，如此一来就有一张比较柔软的床。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed at 10:50; her eyes again open.

It was not the best course, which would have been a psychic one.</td><td>总而言之，鲁柏在这样的处境下采取了明智的做法。这不是最好的做法，本来可以在心灵层面上解决才是最好的途径。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest your break.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:32.

This is a point aside, yet an important one: Food is indeed sacred. Its preparation is more a psychic matter than a physical one. The preparer of food puts more into it than spices. A food can be contaminated, poisoned, by a cook, with no physical elements involved at all. When ten people are poisoned for example by a food, it is no coincidence, and more is involved than mayonnaise left in the sun. Ruburt’s healing nature protects and enriches your meals, and this is an important and constant element in your wellbeing.</td><td>他特别感激，并且觉得透过他吃的食物，他也得到其他的好处，而他的确是。这一点虽然离题，但很重要：食物确实是神圣的。食物的准备不只是物质上的事，更是心灵上的事。准备食物的人放进去的不只是香料。食物可以被厨师污染、下毒，但却完全不涉及任何物质元素。例如，当10个人因食物中毒时，这根本不是巧合，其中涉及的因素不只是美乃滋暴晒在阳光下而已。鲁柏的疗愈本质保护也丰富你的三餐，你之所以平安健康，这是一个持续不变的重要因素。</td></tr><tr><td>In many households steady small illnesses often result because the preparer of foods has an unhealthy psychic nature. These are often the carriers of disease. This is meant as a general statement however, for you are all subject to fluctuating circumstances, and are more or less able to use your abilities.</td><td>在很多家庭当中，经常持续出现的小病，是因为准备食物的人有不健康的心灵本质。这些人往往是疾病的带原者。然而，这番话是一般性的陈述，因为你们全部受到波动的环境影响，而且或多或少能够使用你们的能力。</td></tr><tr><td>For Ruburt once more: Yes, you are perfectly safe with your cat, if you both proceed with your present course. Now, unless you have any questions we will go to other material.</td><td>再一次告诉鲁柏：是的，如果你们两人继续维持现在的做法，你和你的猫在一起非常安全。现在，除非你有任何问题，否则我们要转向其他资料了。</td></tr><tr><td>("Go ahead.” 9:52.)</td><td>(“请便。”9:52。)</td></tr><tr><td>Projections actually involve a change of atomic structure.</td><td>投射实际上涉及到原子结构的变化。</td></tr><tr><td>Consciousness simply changes its form. The physical body is maintained, yet certain chemical changes occur in it also. Initially when projection is first accomplished, there is a strong charge of adrenaline. There is high activity of the thyroid gland. There is a charge of sexual hormones, which are utilized also for projection.</td><td>意识只是改变了它的形式。维持了肉体，但是其中也会发生某些化学变化。一开始在最初完成投射时，肾上腺素会大量分泌。甲状腺会高度活跃。性激素会分泌，也被用来投射。</td></tr><tr><td>After projection is accomplished however there is a marked decline of chemical activity and hormone action, a drop in temperature, sometimes very low, and a drop in blood pressure. There are changes also in the eye mechanisms. The rapid eyes movements noted in the dream state by investigators, cease entirely.</td><td>不过，投射完成之后，化学活性和激素作用会明显下降，体温会下降，有时降到非常低，血压会下降。眼部机制也会有变化。研究人员注意到，在梦状态中的快速眼球运动完全停止。</td></tr><tr><td>The eyes muscles are not used, the normal muscular activity that usually occurs in sleep vanishes. The physical body is in a deep trance state. The trance may be masked also by sleep, if the projection occurs from a dream state. According to the intensity of the projection and according to the systems visited, the physical body becomes more or less rigid when consciousness returns to it.</td><td>眼部肌肉没有被使用到，通常在睡眠中发生的正常肌肉活动消失了。肉体处于深度出神状态。如果是从梦状态投射，那么睡眠也可能会掩盖出神。根据投射的强度而定，也根据被探访的系统而定，当意识返回肉体时，肉体或多或少变得僵硬。</td></tr><tr><td>This is simply a reaction to returning consciousness. There is a subtle difference in the way sugar molecules are utilized. Momentarily the physical body uses less sugar. However the sugar is important in fueling the consciousness on its journey. It aids in connecting the consciousness to the body, and without it under some conditions consciousness could be cut off from return. In other words, there is indeed a connection that is and must be partially physical, between the body and the traveling consciousness, and it is based upon a certain sugar molecule in a form not normally seen.</td><td>这只是对返回的意识产生的一个反应。使用糖分子的方式有一个细微的差别。身体暂时使用比较少的糖。然而，在供应燃料给旅途中的意识这方面，糖是重要的。它有助于把意识连结到肉体上，如果没有它，在某些状况下，意识的归途可能会被切断。换句话说，在肉体和旅行中的意识之间，确实存在一个必然有一部分是物质的连结，而且这个连结的基础是某种以平常看不到的形式呈现的糖分子。</td></tr><tr><td>Before conscious projection I would therefore recommend you take a small amount of starchy or sugar food. This molecular structure thins out, so to speak, and while not physically visible has a physical basis. For projections within other systems, another transformation must and does take place. The physical connection will only allow you to go so far. What amounts to another projection from this first form then occurs.</td><td>因此，在有意识的投射之前，我建议你摄取少量淀粉或糖分的食物。这种分子结构可以说变薄了，虽然在物质上是不可见的，却有一个物质的基础。至于在其他系统之内的投射，另一种转变必须发生也确实发生了。物质连结只能让你走这么远而已。然后，等于是从这第一种形式开始的另一次投射就发生了。</td></tr><tr><td>To return then under such circumstances requires an entry from this second form back into the first, and then into the physical body. You may take your break.</td><td>要在这样的状况下返回，就必须从这第二种形式回到第一种形式，然后再回到肉体。你可以休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:06. Jane out as usual, eyes open often. She again sat at the table for the delivery. She resumed, seated in the rocker and with her eyes closed, at 10:15.)</td><td>(10:06休息。珍像往常一样出去了，眼睛常常睁开。她再次坐在桌边传述。10:15分，她坐摇椅上，闭着眼睛继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>I had intended to begin my practical suggestions this evening, for I will give you a complete set of instructions.</td><td>我打算今天晚上开始讲我的实际建议，因为我会给你一整套操作说明。</td></tr><tr><td>A small snack before bed is a good one you see from this standpoint. Alcohol is of some benefit, though not to any great degree. Excellent results can be achieved in dream-based projections during the day-in a nap. When these are good they will perhaps be the best of any dream-based projections.</td><td>从这个角度来看，睡前吃些点心是个好主意。酒精有一些好处，但助益不大。在白天，午睡时，以梦为基础的投射可以达到绝佳的效果。当这些都很好的时候，它们也许会是任何以梦为基础的投射当中最好的。</td></tr><tr><td>They are also exceedingly safe. The body itself is well stocked, so to speak, and it is possible to maintain projections for a longer period than usual in night projections. I am speaking now only of dream-based projections.</td><td>它们也极其安全。身体本身可以说是库存充足，要维持比平时的夜间投射更长时间的投射是可能的。我现在只谈以梦为基础的投射。</td></tr><tr><td>The morning hours are better than the afternoon hours. The period just before the menstruation cycle is a good one for Ruburt for this purpose. (Pause.)</td><td>上午的时间比下午的时间好。为了这个目的，对鲁柏来说，月经之前的时期是个好时机。(停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>Do you have an envelope for me?</td><td>你有没有信封要给我？</td></tr><tr><td>("Yes.”</td><td>(“有。”)</td></tr><tr><td>(At 10:22, her eyes closed, Jane took the envelope for our 65th experiment from me and pressed it to her forehead in a more or less vertical position.)</td><td>(10:22，珍闭着眼睛，从我这里拿了第65次试验的信封，把或多或少是垂直的它按压在她的额头。)</td></tr><tr><td>Give us a moment, please. These are impressions.</td><td>请给我们一点时间。这些都是印象。</td></tr><tr><td>Stern. I do not know if this refers to stern as severe, or stern as a ship.</td><td>Stern。我不知道这是指严厉之意的stern，还是指船尾之意的stern。</td></tr><tr><td>Connection with a March date, and three. Either March third (pause) or an event involving three people in March. Connection with an event not repeated. Numbers, perhaps 01913.</td><td>与3月的一个日期，和3有关联。不是3月3日(停顿)就是3月份一个涉及3个人的事件。和一个不重复的事件有关联。数字，也许是01913。</td></tr><tr><td>Connection with black, and a small square. This could be symbolic of a death connection, or it could be literal. A word beginning with an M. I do not know—massage, mucilage—leave it for now.</td><td>和黑色以及一个小正方形有关联。这可能是一个死亡关联的象征，也可能是真有其事。一个M开头的字。我不知道——massage(按摩)、mucilage(黏液)——暂时不管它。</td></tr><tr><td>Soothing music perhaps. Four square, or four and four squares.</td><td>也许是抒压的音乐。4个正方形，或4和4个正方形。</td></tr><tr><td>A tree, or tall tree shape. Straight. A word with M again, perhaps this time a name or initial. Ruburt thinks of Marie or Mary. It is a large M, and belongs with a name. This seems very vivid in itself, but it could simply stand for Miss so-and-so you see, or Mrs. A woman connection.</td><td>一棵树或高大的树木形状。笔直的。又是一个M开头的字，也许这次是一个名字或缩写。鲁柏认为是Marie(玛莉)或Mary(玛丽)。它是一个大型的M，属于一个名字。它本身看起来非常生动，但可能只是代表某某小姐，你看，或某某太太。和一个女人有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>An E and a B. A tournament, perhaps symbolic. A crossing, as of swords. Connection with transportation, and perhaps with water. Rectangular object, with some dark coloring, perhaps dark blue. The color reminds me of water at night.</td><td>一个E和一个B。一场锦标赛，也许是象征。交叉，像交叉的剑那样。和交通运输有关联，也许也和水有关联。长方形物体，带点深色，也许是深蓝色。这个颜色让我想到夜里的水。</td></tr><tr><td>An implied border. Writing or printing in a lower left-hand corner perhaps, very small, holding the object horizontally. (Jane gestured with the envelope, which she now held horizontally.)</td><td>一个隐含的边框。也许在左下角有书写字或印刷字，非常小，纵向握住物件。(珍用信封比了一个手势，她现在是垂直握着它。)</td></tr><tr><td>Something on the back also. An oval shape, or eye shape—that is, this kind of an eye, you see (her eyes closed, Jane pointed to one of her own) inside of a rectangle or triangle.</td><td>还有某个在背面的东西。一个椭圆形或眼睛的形状——也就是说，这是一种眼睛，你看，(珍闭着眼睛，指着她自己的一只眼睛)在一个长方形或三角形内。</td></tr><tr><td>The feeling of something hanging over, threatening or overhanging, on the upper half of the object, and dark. Something small and bright also, beneath this overhanging or threatening portion. 1966, also looking forward to 1967. Connection with a photograph I believe, or other object with triangular corners that photographs usually fit into in an album.</td><td>有个东西逼近、压迫或悬垂的感觉，在物件的上半部，而且是深色的。还有某个小而亮的东西，在这个悬垂或压迫的部分。1966年，也期待着1967年。我相信和一张照片有关联，或其他通常可以在相簿里放进照片，边角是长方形的物件有关。</td></tr><tr><td>Two people.

Once again Jane's associations seemed to flow in a fleer manner, this being the third experiment in which this is apparent. We think more data was obtained on this envelope than in previous ones.</td><td>(我们自己找出问题，赛斯验证了其中一些。再一次，珍的联想似乎更自由地流动，这是第三次有这个明显现象的实验。我们认为在这个信封上得到的资料比以前的信封多。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Stern. I do not know if this refers to stern as severe, or stern as a ship. "At first this stumped us. Jane said then that the connection referred to Enfield Glen, which we visited three times during our vacation from July 9. 17. See the notes on page 294 and the tracing on the previous page. The object was obtained July 15, during our vacation, on Friday. Jane recalled that she had wanted to visit the Glen instead of drive to Wellsburg. The connection would be the Glen, where there is a beautiful pool and stream, leading to stern “as a ship.”</td><td>(“Stern。我不知道这是指严厉之意的stern，还是指船尾之意的stern。”起初这难倒我们了。然后珍说这个关联是指恩费尔德峡谷，我们在7月9日到17日度假期间曾去过那里3次。见前面的注释及描摹图。这个物件是7月15日，在我们度假期间，那个星期五取得的。珍记得她本来想要去峡谷而不是开车去威尔斯堡。关联就是峡谷，那里有一个美丽的池水和溪流，所以才会有“船尾这意”的stern。</td></tr><tr><td>( I believe the “well” in Wellsburg, also implying water and thus stern, worked in the same manner here. In addition the first name of the owner of the lumberyard in Wellsburg, which furnished the object, is named Glenn; associating thus with Enfield Glen, or Robert H. Treman State Park near Ithaca, NY.</td><td>(我相信威尔斯堡[Wellsburg]的“Well”[井]，也暗示着水，因为严厉之意的stern，在这里也同样适用。此外，在威尔斯堡的这间木料旁，提供了这次的物件，负责人的名字是格伦[Glenn]；因此它和恩费尔德峡谷，或纽约州伊萨卡附近的罗伯･特雷曼国家公园有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with a March date, and three. Either March third or an event involving three people in March.” We could make no connection here, although Seth was quite positive. Because of the length of the session we did not ask for elaboration.</td><td>(“与3月的一个日期，和3有关联。不是3月3日就是3月份一个涉及3个人的事件。”这里我们找不到任何关联，虽然赛斯非常肯定。由于这一节的长度关系，我们没有要求他详细说明。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with an event not repeated. ’’ I bought two sheets, 4x8 feet, at the lumberyard in Wellsburg on July 15. Since this particular kind of Masonite is hard to find and the Schuyler lumberyard had a good supply, I decided to return to Wellsburg on Saturday, July 23, to buy two more full sheets. But in the interim I figured out a method to coat the Masonite for paintings that obviated the use of any special kind of Masonite, and thus did not return to Wellsburg.</td><td>(“和一个不重复的事件有关联。”我于7月15日在威尔斯堡的木料场买了两张4乘8英寸的薄板。由于这一种纤维板很难找到，斯凯勒木料场有充足的货源，我决定在7月23日星期六返回威尔斯堡，再购买两张全开的薄板。但是在去之前这段期间，我想出一个给纤维上涂层的方法，而不必用到任何特殊种类的纤维板，因此没有返回威尔斯堡。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Numbers, perhaps 01913. "Since the object is a bill, many numbers appear on it. See page 293.  The sequence 01913 does not appear in whole, but the sequence beginning with 0 does appear, in .09. This shows twice on the front of the bill; once via bleed through on the back, also. There are two other sets of numbers visible as ghost images on the back of the bill, and both evidently begin with a zero, but are hard to decipher.</td><td>(“数字，也许是01913。”由于物件是一张账单，因此会出现很多数字。见前面。序列01913不是整体出现，而是以0开头的序列确实出现在09当中。这在账单正面出现两次；还有一次是因为渗透而出现在背面。在账单背面可以看见另外两组数字的叠影，而且显然开头都是0，但是难以辨认。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with black, and a small square. This could be symbolic of a death connection, or it could be literal.” Perhaps it is both. The back of the bill is printed in heavy black ink, the front in red. The arrangement on the back is not square, being more rectangular.</td><td>(“和黑色以及一个小正方形有关联。这可能是一个死亡关联的象征，也可能是真有其事。”也许两者皆是。账单的背面是用深黑色油墨印刷的，正面是红色。背面的排列不是正方形，比较接近长方形。</td></tr><tr><td>(The death connection enters in because the bill was filled out by the worker at the lumberyard who obtained and cut the Masonite so it would fit into our station wagon. The worker—whose name we do not know, but could easily learn—became quite talkative when he learned I planned to use the Masonite as support for paintings. He described to us in some detail how he had a portrait of himself drawn during the Second World War, when he was overseas. War...death. The conversation was unusual in that the worker explained how the artist drew his face as though it was symmetrical, whereas in reality it is quite asymmetrical, with an impaired eye.</td><td>(与死亡关联之所以进入资料中，是因为填写账单的是木料场的一名工人，他取出并裁切纤维板，以便把它放进我们的旅行车。这名工人——我们不知道他的名字，但很容易就可以查到——得知我计划用纤维板来支撑画作时，变得相当健谈。他向我们详细描述第二次世界大战期间，他在海外时怎样让人帮他自己画一幅肖像。战争……死亡。这番交谈很不寻常，因为工人解释了画家如何画出他的脸，仿佛它是对称的，而实际上它是非常不对称的，因为一眼有损伤。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A word beginning with an M.” The middle initial of the proprietor of the lumberyard: Glenn M. Schuyler, shown in large red type on the bill. Another M enters in later. There is a chance here that Seth did not mean an initial. In this event, it can be said we made the trip to Wellsburg for the express purpose of buying Masonite.</td><td>(“一个M开头的字。”木料场老板的中间名缩写：格伦･M･斯凯勒，以大型红色印刷字体显示在账单上。另一个M稍后也进来了。这里有可能赛斯的意思并不是指缩写。在这个事件里，可以说我们是特地为了买纤维板才去威尔斯堡。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane however had an image of a large capital M, she said, in which case the first interpretation applies above. Seth mentions an initial specifically later but not above. Jane was aware of no color in her image; she saw the M alone.</td><td>(然而，珍有一个意象是大型的大写字M，她说，在这种情况下，上文的第一个解读是适用的。赛斯稍后特别提到一个缩写，但上文不适用。珍觉察到她的意象没有颜色；她只看到了M。</td></tr><tr><td>(Seth continues the above data, and gives another instance of the freer association employed, all stemming from the letter M: “ I do not know—massage, mucilage—leave it for now. "Jane said the mucilage connection referred to the word cement on the bill heading, beneath the Schuyler name.</td><td>(赛斯继续上述资料，并给了另一个更自由的联想实例，全部来自字母M:“一个M开头的字。我不知道——massage(按摩)、mucilage(黏液)——暂时不管它。”珍说与黏液的关联指的是账单标目当中，在斯凯勒名字下面的cement[水泥]这个字。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Soothing music perhaps. "Jane said this is a distortion of the massage data above, massage and music both being soothing.</td><td>(“也许是抒压的音乐。”珍说这是上述按摩资料的扭曲，按摩和音乐两者都很抒压。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Four square, or four and four squares.” This I regard as excellent data pertaining to the object, whereas Jane said it had no particular meaning for her because she didn’t know the specifics concerning the way I usually buy Masonite.</td><td>(“4个正方形，或4和4个正方形。”我认为这一样是有关物件的绝佳资料，而珍说它对她而言没有特别的意义，因为她不晓得我平常购买纤维板的方式具体是怎样。</td></tr><tr><td>(The object shows I bought two full sheets of Masonite, each one 4x8 feet in dimension. The worker previously mentioned at the lumberyard cut the sheets in half so that we could load them into the car. This gave four pieces of Masonite, each one of which was four feet square.</td><td>(物件显示我买了两片全开的纤维板，每片的尺寸都是4*8英寸。之前提到的木料场工人把两片都切成两半，好让我们可以把它们装入车内。这样就有4片纤维板，每片都是4英尺见方的正方形。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A tree, or tall tree shape.” The bill’s heading contains the word lumber, a product of trees. Masonite of course is a lumber product, but the connection is farther removed from the object, perhaps, in this case.</td><td>(“一棵树或高大的树木形状。”账单的标目包含木材这个词，木材是树木的一种产品。纤维板当然是木材产品，但在这种情况下，也许这个关联距离物件比较远。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Straight.” We associate this with the tree data above. Lumber usually being straight as opposed to crooked.</td><td>(“笔直的。”我们把这一条和上面的树木资料联想在一起。木材通常是笔直而不是弯曲的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A word with M again, perhaps this time a name or initial.” Ruburt thinks of Marie or Mary. It is a large M, and belongs with a name. This seems very vivid in itself but it could simply stand for Miss So-and-So, you see, or Mrs. A woman connection.” Seth here evidently refers to a different name this time than that shown on the bill, Glenn M. Schuyler. Jane is subjectively sure Seth was getting at the name of Mrs. Marilyn Wilbur, who lives with her husband Don in Wellsburg; the Wilburs are good friends of ours. The Marie or Mary is very suggestive of Marilyn.</td><td>(“又是一个M开头的字，也许这次是一个名字或缩写。鲁柏认为是Marie(玛莉)或Mary(玛丽)。它是一个大型的M，属于一个名字。它本身看起来非常生动，但可能只是代表某某小姐，你看，或某某太太。和一个女人有关联。”这里赛斯显然是指一个与账单上显示的名字格伦·M·斯凯勒不同的名字。珍在主观上确定赛斯要传达的名字是玛丽莲·韦伯太太，她和丈夫唐一起住在威尔斯堡；韦伯夫妇是我们的好朋友。玛莉或玛丽都很容易让人联想到玛丽莲。</td></tr><tr><td>(“An E and a B.” There are words beginning with E and B on the object, but the data is too general.</td><td>(“一个E和一个B。”在物件上有E和B开头的字，但这个资料过于笼统。</td></tr><tr><td>(“A tournament, perhaps symbolic. A crossing, as of swords. "Jane was sure this referred to the story told us by the worker at the lumberyard, who procured the Masonite for me, concerning his war service, his portrait, etc., done while he was in the service. The worker made out the bill which served as object.</td><td>(“一场锦标赛，也许是象征。交叉，像交叉的剑那样。”珍确信这是指木料场那位帮我取来纤维板工人告诉我们的故事，讲到他服役时参战的历程、他在从军期间请人完成的肖像画等等。用来当作物件的账单是这名工人填写的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with transportation.” This could be our trip to Wellsburg, specifically to buy the Masonite. A distance of perhaps ten miles each way.</td><td>(“和交通运输有关联。”这可能是指我们前往威尔斯堡的旅行，特别是购买纤维板这件事，单程距离可能是10英里。</td></tr><tr><td>(“And perhaps with water.” This could stem from the wells in Wellsburg, as explained earlier, or from the fact that Jane would have preferred going to Enfield Glen to swim, instead of buying Masonite. Also, we planned to go swimming locally after getting the Masonite, but became so busy we did not do so.</td><td>(“也许和水有关联。”这可能源于威尔斯堡的井，之前已经解释过，或是出自珍本来比较想去恩费尔德峡谷游泳而不是买纤维板这个事实。此外，我们计划买了纤维板之后去当地游泳，但后来太忙了，所以没有这么做。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Rectangular object, with some dark coloring, perhaps dark blue. The color reminds me of water at night.” The bill used as object is rectangular in shape. The back of it is printed in black. The price and date applied automatically by the register at the top of the bill is in a medium blue ink. Since we have the carbon copy, the handwriting on the bill is in a dark blue or gray. These three points can all be included in the “dark coloring" category, and blue is given specifically by Seth.</td><td>(“长方形物体，带点深色，也许是深蓝色。这个颜色让我想到夜里的水。”用作标的物的账单是长方形的。它的背面是黑色印刷。账单顶部由收银员自动登录的价格和日期用的是蓝色。由于我们有副本，所以知道账单上的笔迹是深蓝色或灰色。这三点都可以包含在“深色”这个类别里，而蓝色是赛斯特别提到的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“An implied border.

However if she held the object so that its head, or top, pointed to the right as she faced it, then there would be printing along the left-hand side of the bill. This being the fine print at the bottom of the front of the bill.</td><td>(“也许在左下角有书写字或印刷字，非常小，纵向握住物件。”此时，珍拿着横向的信封。我们没有在信封或物件加上标记来验证这个资料。但是，如果她这样拿着物件，以至于当她面对它时，它的上端或顶部便指向右侧，那么沿着账单左侧就有印刷字。这是在账单正面底部的小型印刷字。</td></tr><tr><td>(If Jane held the object with its head pointing to the left as she faced it, then the price and date would be at the left edge of the bill. This copy is larger however.</td><td>(如果珍拿着物件时面对着它，它的上端指向左侧，那么价格和日期就会在账单左边的边缘。但是这个副本比较大。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Something on the back also.” There is black printing on the back of the object, plus a bleed through of the price and date at the top, and a couple of ghost images of other price-and-date data beneath, in reverse.</td><td>(“还有某个在背面的东西。”物件背面有黑色印刷字，还有顶端渗透过去的价格和日期，以及下面其他价格和日期资料的叠影，字都是反的。</td></tr><tr><td>(“An oval shape, or eye shape—that is, this kind of an eye, you see, inside of a rectangle or triangle. "Jane pointed to her own eye while giving this data. It is very good. As stated earlier the worker at the lumberyard who procured the Masonite for me, then made out the bill used as object, had a bad eye. It will be recalled that the worker described a portrait drawn of him while he was in the service; and that the artist making the portrait drew him with a symmetrical face, whereas his face is decidedly not symmetrical.</td><td>(“一个椭圆形或眼睛的形状——也就是说，这是一种眼睛，你看，在一个长方形或三角形内。”珍在给出这个资料时指着她自己的眼睛。这个资料非常好。之前说过，在木料场帮我取来纤维板，然后填写这张用来当物件的账单那名工人，他有一只眼睛坏了。记得工人描述了他在服役期间请人画的一幅肖像；以及那幅肖像的画家帮他画了一张对称的脸，但他的脸明显不对称。</td></tr><tr><td>(The rectangle or triangle data refers to the fact that the worker wears glasses.</td><td>(长方形或三角形资料指的是工人戴着眼镜的事实。</td></tr><tr><td>(“The feeling of something hanging over, threatening or overhanging, on the upper half of the object, and dark.” This is most interesting, and is an example of the new method in which Seth gives Jane some of her data now. Jane said it was difficult to describe, but she had the very definite impression, or feeling or image, within, of a large dark overhanging mass above her, as a roof might be, for instance. This impression was strong, and she believes the overhanging feeling led her to attach the threatening data to it.</td><td>(“有个东西逼近、压迫或悬垂的感觉，在物件的上半部，而且是深色的。”这个非常有意思，是赛斯现在用一个新方法把珍的一些资料传给她的例子。珍说这很难描述，但她的内在有一个非常明确的印象、感觉或意象是，一团巨大的黑色悬垂物体在她上方，比方说，可能是屋顶之类的。这个印象很强烈，她相信这个悬垂的感觉导致她把胁迫资料附加在它上面。</td></tr><tr><td>(On the object, the first word in the heading beneath the name is Roofing. This ties in neatly with the next data. Note also that the word Roofing is located on the upper half of the object; that is, high up on the object, as a roof would usually be over the head of an observer.</td><td>(在物件上，名字下方的标目里，第一个字词是屋顶[Roofing]。这和下一个资料完全连结在一起。另外也请注意，屋顶这个词位于物件的上半部；也就是说，高居在物件上方，就像屋顶通常都高出观察者的头部一样。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Something bright and small also, beneath this overhanging or threatening portion. "Again, very interesting when the bill is studied. Note that the I Roller Pan is written on the bill directly beneath the word Roofing, which is referred to in the data above. Thus, the position of the roller pan is interpreted literally by Seth as being under a roof—quite a logical position. The roller pan, which I never used, is of course bright and shiny, tin coated probably, and is small in comparison to a roof size.</td><td>(“还有某个小而亮的东西，在这个悬垂或压迫的部分。”再一次，在研究该账单时非常有趣。注意在账单上，一个滚筒盘就写在上述资料提到的屋顶一词正下方。因此，赛斯字面把滚筒的位置解读成在屋顶上——相当合乎逻辑的位置。我从未使用过的滚筒盘当然是明亮又有光泽，可能是镀锡的，而且和屋顶的尺寸比较起来很小。</td></tr><tr><td>(“1966, also looking to 1967. " Note the box on the front of the bill bearing the words Account forwarded. Since I bought the Masonite in 1966, and presumably would keep an account going at the lumberyard, any sum due would be carried over into 1967.</td><td>(“1966年，也期待着1967年。”注意账单正面的方框里面有转账的字样。自从我在1966年买了纤维板，而且可能在木料场留下一个账户之后，任何应付款项都会保存到1967年。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Connection with a photograph, I believe, or other object with triangular corners that photographs usually fit into in an album.

This basic information perhaps led to the above data, but we believe the following is more likely correct.</td><td>(“我相信和一张照片有关联，或其他通常可以在相簿里放进照片，边角是长方形的物件有关。”之前说过，木料的工人描述了他在海外请人画的一幅肖像。这个基本资讯可能是上述资料的起因，但我们相信下文比较可能是正确的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane had an image of a photo of the two of us, taken at Enfield Glen. Remember that she wanted to go to the Glen on July 15, rather than to the lumberyard in Wellsburg to buy Masonite. No photos of us have been taken at the Glen in recent years. Also, the Glen idea links up with the proprietor of the lumberyard, Glenn M. Schuyler.</td><td>(珍有一个意象是，一张我们两个人的照片，在恩费尔德峡谷拍的。记住，她想要在7月15日前往峡谷，而不是去威尔斯堡的木料场买纤维板。我们没有近年来在峡谷拍的照片。此外，Glen[峡谷]的概念与木料场老板格伦·M·斯凯勒[Glenn M Schuyler]连结在一起。</td></tr><tr><td>("Two people.

An event in March, that led to similar events while the original one was not repeated. I believe the letter G is somehow connected with this event.” We still could make no connections for this data, and I did not ask Seth to explain. Jane had a mental image of a single G, nothing else. There is Glenn on the bill used as object, but this wouldn’t refer back to March; our July visit was our first ever to this particular lumberyard.</td><td>(第一个问题:“你能不能多说一点3月日期的事？”“3月(March)，进展，向前行(march along)。3月的一个事件，导致类似事件，但原来的事件没有重复。我相信字母G和这次事件有某种关联。”我们仍然找不到与这个资料有关联，我也没有要求赛斯解释。珍有一个心象是单一个G，没有别的。在用作物件的账单上有一个Glenn，但这不会又回头指3月；7月那一次是我们第一次到这一家木料场。</td></tr><tr><td>(Question: “Well, suppose you try naming the object, then.” “1 came as close as I can, in the data given.”</td><td>(提问:“嗯，那么，你就尝试指出物件的名称吧。”“在给出的资料中，我已经尽可能接近了。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Question: “Can you say something more about four squares?” “ I believe not.” See the four square data on page 301, referring to the Masonite I bought and had cut to size. I wanted to see if Jane could be more specific here, since she had already given excellent data, but she could not. As stated, the four squares data meant nothing to her, but quite a lot to me. Perhaps her lack of conscious interest prevented more information here.</td><td>(问题:“你能不能多说一些4个正方形的事？”“我不信不能。”见前面4个方形资料，指的是我买了并对切的纤维板。既然珍已经给出很好的资料，我想看看这里珍能不能更具体，但是她不能。如上所述，4个正方形资料对她来说毫无意义，但对我来说很有意义。也许这里她在意识上的兴趣缺缺而阻挡了更多的资讯。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed with her eyes closed and her glasses on at 11:27.)</td><td>(珍在11:27继续，闭着眼睛，戴起眼镜。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will close.

The swords were bayonets.</td><td>锦标赛确实是指一场战争。剑是指刺刀。</td></tr><tr><td>My heartiest regards. Advances are being made that will begin to show themselves rather clearly. Ruburt was correct as far as he went, in describing the way in which he received the information regarding the roof. This is also something quite new. We will attempt to mix it also with visual data. It will serve finally to round out and pinpoint information more concisely. I will briefly discuss this particular point at our next session. It regards a method of perception that you use subconsciously but never recognize—a sense that is something like the way you register temperature.</td><td>我最诚挚的问候。正在取得的进展，将会开始相当清楚地自行展现。鲁柏描述他接收屋顶相关资讯的方式，就他的部分而言，他说的没错。这也是一个很新的尝试。我们试图把它和视觉资料混合在一起。它最终会更简洁地呈现既完善又精准的资讯。我将在下一节简要讨论这一点。它和你在潜意识里使用但从不认识的一种感知方法有关系——一种感官，就像你感觉温度的方式那样。</td></tr><tr><td>And now good evening, my dear friends. I enjoy our sessions. I regret the limitations that necessarily prevent longer sessions. I am with you both often,</td><td>现在，亲爱的朋友们，晚安。我喜欢我们的课。为了避免课太长而必要设下的限制，我觉得很遗憾。我经常与你们两人同在，而且非常看重你们。</td></tr><tr><td>and regard you highly. You are good students.

Good evening.</td><td>现在。晚安。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Good evening, Seth. ’)</td><td>(“晚安，赛斯。)</td></tr><tr><td>Your waking consciousness only participates in projections as a rule when you are in a period of high vitality, and exceptional health.</td><td>你的醒时意识通常只在你处于生命力高昂而且格外健康的时期，才会参与投射。</td></tr><tr><td>On occasion the waking consciousness does participate during other usually very depressed periods. But generally speaking high energy is needed in order to maintain overall stability, and in order that the ego is not overstrained. Such conscious projections are automatically spaced out. In this way there is little danger that problems will arise.</td><td>偶尔，在其他通常非常沮丧的时期，醒时意识的确会参与。但一般来说，为了维持整体的稳定，也为了不让自我过度紧绷，高能量是有需要的。这样的意识投射自动拉开间距。如此一来，不会有出现问题的危险。</td></tr><tr><td>It is the same with the conscious retention of dreams in general. You are indeed exercising what amounts to an added ability. You are learning to manipulate within other dimensions of consciousness. Automatic controls are therefore used. (Voice somewhat deeper.) You proceed as your abilities and control develop.</td><td>一般而言，有意识地记住梦也一样。你确实正在运用相当于一种额外能力的东西。你正学习在意识的其他维度之内进行操纵。因此会使用到自动控制。(声音有点低沉)你随着自身能力和控制力的发展继续前进。</td></tr><tr><td>Suggestion given before sleep will greatly add to your chances of conscious projections from the dream state. It is not necessary, basically speaking, that you notice some small incongruous detail in order to realize while dreaming that you are dreaming. There is however one good method to use. The suggestion “ I will realize while dreaming that I am dreaming” can also be used, as another method, or both of these may be utilized together.</td><td>睡前给的暗示会大大提高你有意识地从梦状态开始投射的机会。基本上，你没有必要为了在你做梦时发觉你在做梦，而去注意一些不一致的小细节。然而，有一个好方法可以用。“我会在做梦时发觉我在做梦”的暗示，可以当作另一个方法来用，或这两者一起也可以。</td></tr><tr><td>At your stage it is of course easier if the actual separation of consciousness from the physical body occurs without your awareness. However the experience itself is excellent training. I have told you that these projections may carry you to different systems. In the beginning you are safer perhaps in those projections that involve your own reality.</td><td>在你的阶段，如果意识确实脱离肉体而你却没有觉知，当然比较容易。但是，经验本身就是绝佳的训练。我告诉过你，这些投射可能带你到不同的系统去。刚开始，在那些与你自己的实相有关的投射当中，你可能会比较安全。</td></tr><tr><td>There is not any great matter of danger, only that you could fall into blunders. The north-south position is most beneficial. It might be of benefit if you concentrate before sleep upon a simple projection that involves leaving the body, walking out into this room, for example, (the living room) or perhaps strolling around the block.</td><td>不是什么重大危险，只是你可能会犯些错而已。南北向最有帮助。如果你在睡前集中注意力在一个简单的投射，比方说离开身体、走出这个房间(起居室)，或者在街区周围漫步，可能会有帮助。</td></tr><tr><td>When falling off to sleep for example, imagine that you are in your yard, in another room of your apartment, or in front of the house. When this method is effective you will not be consciously aware of the actual separation however. I do not suggest at this point that you or Ruburt attempt to contact me during any projection. Later, when you have more training.</td><td>例如，当你躺下来睡觉时，想像你在院子里，在公寓的另一个房间或房子前面。不管怎样，当这个方法生效时，你对实际的分离就不会有意识觉知了。此时我不建议你或鲁柏在任何投射期间尝试联系我。以后，你有了更多训练再说。</td></tr><tr><td>If by chance you blunder (smile, eyes open) into my territory, then I will know it, and seek you out. Whenever you find yourself in any potentially dangerous dream situation during a projection, immediately terminate the dream. You will then return to an ordinary state of consciousness.</td><td>如果你偶然不小心(微笑，眼睛睁开)闯入我的地盘，我会知道，而且会把你找出来。在投射期间，每当你发现自己陷入任何潜在危险的梦情况时，就要立即终止这个梦。然后你就会回到平常的意识状态。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Mr. Fox is quite correct. When you know you are in a projection do not be tempted to tamper. There are forces that you do not yet understand. You will find that these projections become more vivid. I must repeat that these are quite valid. They are not hallucinations. Conscious projections do not occur with any frequency as far as a large percentage of humanity is concerned. Note that I speak only now of projections in which you are self-consciously aware.</td><td>现在。福克斯先生说得很对。当你知道你处于投射时，不要试图窜改。有你还不了解的力量存在。你会发现这些投射变得比较生动。我必须重申，这些都是非常有效力的。它们不是幻相。就大部分人类而言，有意识的投射不常发生。要注意，我现在只谈你有意识觉知的投射。</td></tr><tr><td>The reasons are somewhat obvious. Conscious projections are dependent upon abilities and control. Also this ability and control presupposes a fairly disciplined personality. Otherwise we would have explosive outbursts of suddenly released aggressions in systems where they do not belong.</td><td>原因有点明显。有意识的投射取决于能力的控制。此外，这种能力控制的先决条件是相当自律的人格。否则，在不是它们所属的系统中，突然释放的攻击性就会爆发。</td></tr><tr><td>It is quite possible to meet survival personalities, incidentally, during such projections. This does not happen often, because so many other issues are necessary. It is also possible of course to move into your own future. This occurs regularly, though not always with awareness. Projections into the past are also frequent.</td><td>在这样的投射中，遇见死后犹存的人格是很有可能的。这种情况之所以不常发生，是因为其他必要的问题太多了。当然也可以进入你自己的未来。这种状况经常发生，但不一定都带着觉知。投射到过去也很常有。</td></tr><tr><td>Because of some matters we have not yet discussed, at any rate deeply, it is possible to meet your own projection. You are accountable for acts committed during projections, of course, and these alter the personality as any acts do. If you have your wits about you, you can gain information concerning the future by studying your projection environment, if for any reason you suppose it to be ahead of you in time.</td><td>因为一些我们还没有讨论过，或至少还没有深入讨论过的事情，所以遇见你自己的投射是可能的。当然，你要为投射过程中的所作所为负责，而且就像任何行为一样，这些行为也会改变人格。如果你保持冷静，就能够研究你的投射环境，借此获得有关未来的资讯，要是你基于任何原因而认为在时间当中未来在你前面的话。</td></tr><tr><td>Some of this is extremely complicated. You may for example request before sleep that you project into your own future, to see what occurs there. This is legitimate enough, if you are willing to accept the results of your projections. For what you see will influence what you do in the present. You will be projecting of course into the probable future as it exists for you at this point.</td><td>这其中有一些非常复杂。例如，你可以在睡前要求，你投射到你自己的未来，看看那里发生什么事。如果你愿意接受你的投射结果，那么这就有足够的效力。因为你看到的将会影响你现在的作为。当然，你会投射到可能的未来，它对你而言，此时此刻就存在。</td></tr><tr><td>The very act of projecting will alter these probabilities. I am not saying that this future environment is not real, however. It is as real as your present environment indeed, you understand this.</td><td>投射的行为本身将会改变这些可能性。但是，我不是说这个未来的环境不真实。它确实和你现在的环境一样真实，这一点你了解。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Yes.” Jane stared at me, then took a long pause with her eyes closed.)</td><td>(“是的。”珍盯着我看，然后闭着眼睛停顿良久。)</td></tr><tr><td>Do not touch another figure if you have reason to believe that it is a traveling form like your own. You will have to learn to distinguish. When you realize that you are dreaming, and if in the dream you are with another person, then tell him that you are both dreaming, and note his response.</td><td>如果你有理由相信它是一个旅行中的形式，就像你自己的形式那样，就不要碰触另一个人物。你必须学会辨别。当你发觉自己在做梦时，如果在梦中你和另一个人在一起，那就告诉他，你们两个都在做梦，并且留意他的回应。</td></tr><tr><td>You may now take your break.</td><td>你现在可以休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:40. Jane had been dissociated as usual. Her eyes had come to open often. She had spoken with many short pauses, sipped iced tea and smoked. Her voice had been average.</td><td>(9:40休息。珍像往常一样出离。她的眼睛经常睁开。她说话时有很多短暂地停顿，喝了冰茶，也抽了烟。她的声音不急不徐。</td></tr><tr><td>(She resumed in the same manner at 9:52.)</td><td>(9:52，她再以同样的方式继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>During projection you are dealing with environments and realities with which you are not acquainted on a conscious level. Yet during projections you will be consciously aware of them.</td><td>在投射期间，你正在打交道的是，你在意识层面上不熟悉的环境和实相。可是，在投射期间，你对它们是有意识觉知的。</td></tr><tr><td>(Long pause.) You understand how physical matter is formed. You will be dealing with realities in which the durability of images is far different. You will be much more aware of the shifting guise of materialized images. You will be aware of the mental energy and psychic force that gives all objects their existence.</td><td>(长时间停顿)你了解物质是如何形成的。你将会面对意象的耐久性截然不同的实相。对于物质化意象的变动外观，你会更有觉知。你会觉察到所有物体据以存在的心智能量和心灵力量。</td></tr><tr><td>I suggest you take a cat break. I will wait.</td><td>我建议你休息一下。我等着。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Okay.” Our cat Willy had been kicking up a fuss, so at 9:561 got up to put him in a back room. Jane sat waiting quietly, still in trance, then resumed when I sat down.)</td><td>(“好。”我们的猫威立一直在吵闹，所以我在9:56分起身，把它放在后面的房间里。珍静静等着，仍然在出神中，然后在我坐下时继续。)</td></tr><tr><td>You will to some degree learn control amid a conglomeration of energy forces that have no objective form. All objects as you know are energy. If the energy is focused in a particular manner, then you have physical objects within your system.</td><td>在某种程度上，你将在一团没有任何客观形式的能量势力中学会控制。你知道，所有的物体都是能量。如果能量以特定方式聚焦，那么在你的系统之内就会有实质的物体。</td></tr><tr><td>There are also potential objects. The energy is focusing toward materialization. There is also energy that will never focus in this way. The bulk of this energy is mental, or exists in such a way that you will never perceive it as form. It has motion. This motion follows certain laws which we will not discuss at this time.</td><td>还有潜在的物体。能量正聚焦于物质化。也有能量永远不会以这种方式聚焦。这种能量大部分是心智能量，或以一种你永远不会感知它是形式的方式存在。它有动作。这个动作遵循某些法则，我们目前不讨论这些法则。</td></tr><tr><td>You may experience this in your projections. Perhaps as a barrier to your own motion, or perhaps as a propelling agent, over which you have little control. It is not harmful but may surprise you. It is not correct precisely to call this a current, although spiritualistic literature speaks of it as such.</td><td>你可能会在投射中体验到这种能量。也许它是你自己在行动时的一个障碍，也许它是一个推动的因素，你几乎无法控制它。它虽然无害，但可能会让你大吃一惊。尽管灵性文献都这么称呼它，但是把它称之为电流(current)不太正确。</td></tr><tr><td>It is very simply the energy that composes your universe, only you are usually familiar with it when it is formed into matter exclusively. Now it is this that may carry you to other systems, though the word carry seems to imply a motion backward or forward. The motion may feel backward or forward, but instead there is an immersion into various depths.</td><td>构成你们宇宙的能量非常简单，只不过通常在它完全形成物质时，你才会熟悉它。现在，可能会带你到其他系统的正是这种能量，虽然“带”这个字似乎意味着向后或向前的运作。动作可能感觉起来是向后或向前，但反而是沉浸在各种不同深度之中。</td></tr><tr><td>On very few occasions you may, if you are lucky, travel or project so effectively that you are aware of the spacious present, in which case you will sense the reality of all systems simultaneously. But here there is a strong possibility that memory of the experience in its entirety will not be retained.</td><td>在极少数情况下，要是幸运的话，你是可以如此有效地旅行或投射，而觉知广阔的现在，在这种状况下，你会同时感觉到所有系统的实相。但是这里有一个很大的可能性是，整个经验的记忆不会保留下来。</td></tr><tr><td>All projections involve literally an extension of identity and self. The usual limitations set upon the self by the ego vanish. Now. This gives some hint of the abilities that exist for the individual in future existences. (Long pause, head down, eyes closed.) Whether or not projections are conscious, they occur in any case, and the personality learns from them. The conscious projection however involves a much higher achievement. (Long pause.)</td><td>所有的投射都涉及到本体和自己的扩展。自我通常对自己设下的限制消失了。现在。这为个体在未来的存在中具备的能力提供一些线索。(长时间停顿，低着头，闭着眼睛)无论投射是否有意识，它们无论如何都会发生，而且人格也会从中学习。然而，有意识的投射涉及更高的成就。(长时间停顿)</td></tr><tr><td>One point: There is involved here a freedom from your physical time that can be gained in no other way. This freedom is extremely refreshing, and has therapeutic results unless the experience is overindulged in. There is a benefit for the physical body also. It is momentarily free of any irritating demands put upon it by a divided personality, automatically for example free from aggressions and unhealthy aspects of this nature. I mentioned that double and even triple projections can occur as you adopt forms. These forms represent forms that your personality will take in future existences.</td><td>一个重点：这里涉及的是一种不受物理时间束缚的自由，这是透过其他方式也无法得到的自由。这种自由极具提振精神的作用，而且除非过度沉迷于这个经验，否则它也有疗愈的效果。此外，它对身体也有好处。身体暂时摆脱一个分裂人格施加其上的任何讨人厌的要求，比方说，摆脱攻击性以及这种性质的不健康面向。我提到过，在你采用形式时，可能会发生重、甚至三重投射。这些形式代表你的人格在未来存在中将会采用的形式。</td></tr><tr><td>They are adopted to meet the particular requirements of the environment in which they are used. In some dreams individuals see what they imagine to he the image of their own dead self. Instead they have been projecting, and see one of their own projected forms that they have themselves just vacated.</td><td>它们被采用，是为了满足它们在其中被使用的那个环境特有的需求。在一些梦中，个体看见他们想像是死去的自己会有的形象。反之，他们其实是在投射，而看到他们自己已投射的形式之一，这个形式就是他们自己刚刚空出来的形式。</td></tr><tr><td>These forms do exist, as your physical body does. They are fused however with your inner self. They are not physical, but they do exist in the whole package of the self, perhaps like the skins of an onion, you see. They are merely the forms that your own consciousness takes in different dreams.</td><td>这些形式确实存在，就像你的肉体一样。然而，它们与你的内我融合在一起。它们不是物质形式，但它们确实存在整套的自己之外，也许就像一颗洋葱的皮，你看。它们只是你自己的意识在不同的梦中采用的形式而已。</td></tr><tr><td>You may take a break.</td><td>你可以休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:25. Jane out more than usual. She had some little difficulty getting her eyes open at break; also, her eyes had remained closed during the delivery except for a couple of short intervals.

She used many pauses.</td><td>(10:25休息。珍比平常出去的更远。在休息时，她有点难以睁开眼睛；而且，除了一两次短暂的间隔之外，她的眼睛在传述期间一直闭着。不过她倒是记得威立造成的干扰。她有过很多次的停顿。</td></tr><tr><td>(She resumed in a more active manner, her pace faster, at 10:36.)</td><td>(10:36，她以更活泼的方式继续，速度更快。)</td></tr><tr><td>This energy may carry you, then, with startling rapidity away to another environment.</td><td>然后，这种能量可能以惊人的速度把你带走，去到另一个环境。</td></tr><tr><td>When you become proficient this can be avoided to some extent, but never entirely. Because of the nature of such projections you are not stationed, so to speak, within any of the systems through which you may pass. Therefor you cannot expect any great permanence for yourself within them.</td><td>当你熟练以后，这种情况在某种程度上是可以避免的，但是永远无法完全避免。由于这种投射的性质，可以说你不是驻扎在任何你可以通过的系统之内。因此，你不能指望你自己在它们之内会有任何非常持久不变的状况。</td></tr><tr><td>The perceptions of those who exist within them are basically different than your own, and many of them will not perceive you. Those who do are apt to be projecting also, you see. I told you that if you can you should mention the fact that you are dreaming. If the other individual realizes this also, then you are both projecting. He may on the other hand be projecting and not be aware of the fact.</td><td>那些存在它们之内的个体拥有基本上不同于你的感知，他们当中有很多不会感知到你。你知道，那些感知到你的个体也很容易投射，你。我告诉过你，如果可以的话，你应该提到你在做梦的事实。如果另一个个体也发觉这件事，那么你们两者就都在投射。另一方面，他可能正在投射，但对这个事实毫无知觉。</td></tr><tr><td>Again, make no effort to touch any other individual you meet, particularly if there is reason to believe he is also projecting. This will be uncomfortable for you both.</td><td>再一次，不要努力去碰触其他任何你遇到的个体，特别是有理由相信他也在投射的时候。这对你们两个来说都会不舒服。</td></tr><tr><td>Now, as always regretfully, I will close our session.

He is concerned, you see, over the publication of his book, period.</td><td>(笑)你看，他担心他出书的事，就这样而已。他之所以担心，只不过是因为内在这些极大的努力现在将会显现于外到某种程度。</td></tr><tr><td>He is concerned simply because these strong inner efforts will now become exteriorized to some extent.

He is in many ways extremely individualistic. He fights for what he believes in, but he also has strong docile tendencies, which are usually rather effectively controlled. These rise up, you see however, in direct proportion to the degree of his independent accomplishments, so that he then fears the accumulated results, social results, of what he has done. It is therefore fairly natural that when this accomplishment is being exteriorized he would become frightened of the opinion of his brethren.</td><td>他为他自己的信念奋斗，但他也有强烈的温顺倾向，但后者通常都在相当有效的控制之下。然而，你看，这些都跟着他独立完成的程度成正比升高，因此他恐惧他做的事所累积的结果，社会结果。所以，当这个成就显现在外的时候，他开始害怕他的弟兄们会有什么意见，这是相当自然的事。</td></tr><tr><td>These are two faces of the same coin.</td><td>这些是同一枚硬币的两面。</td></tr><tr><td>The delay bothers him simply because he is in suspense of the imagined rebuffs.

I give voice to ideas that are known to various levels of your personalities, yet I am not at the level of your personalities.</td><td>我们全部同时存在很多维度里。我们之间主要的差别在于，我对我在很多维度的存在有觉知，而你对你在很多维度的存在没有觉知。在我们的课里，我们形成了一个新的维度。我表达出你人格的各个层面所知的概念，但我和你的人格不在同一个层面。</td></tr><tr><td>There are no limits to the types of projections that can occur, basically speaking, for there are no limitations to the self, and a projection is an extension of the self. Your present existence is of course a projection. Activities based upon the framework of your present existence must be initiated within a system of chemicals and physical properties which make physical existence possible.</td><td>基本上，可能发生的投射类型是没有任何限制的，因为自己是没有任何限制的，而投射就是自己的延伸。你当下的存在当然是一种投射。以你当下的存在架构为基础的活动必须在一个系统之内启动，这个系统拥有的化学物质和物理特性使存在成为可能。</td></tr><tr><td>If life within the physical organism is to be maintained, then consciousness must return to it. This does not mean that consciousness is dependent upon the physical organism. There will be [an] endless series of projections in other existences, and these will have no chemical basis as you know it. Your traveling consciousness appears as an apparition within some other systems.</td><td>如果要维持物质有机体之内的生命，那么意识必须回到它身上。这并不是说意识依赖物质有机体。在其他存在中有无穷无尽的一连串投射，而这些投射并没有你所知的化学基础。你那旅行中的意识是以显灵的形式出现在其他一些系统之内。</td></tr><tr><td>Your own thoughts have a reality that you do not understand, and their own kind of form, or psychic content, and this content exists not as pure energy, but as energy with form and shape. And when it is perceived by you, then it has bulk. The bulk is the result of your own perception. The bulk, or mass, is perceived whether or not the ideas have ever been materialized as physical matter.</td><td>你自己的思想有一个你不了解的实相，也有它们自己的一种形式或心灵内容，这种内容不是纯粹的能量，而是具有形式和形状的能量。当你感知它时，它就会有体积。体积是你自己的感知造成的结果。无</td></tr><tr><td>Whenever you come in contact with a particular idea form, and this will only happen in projections, then you will automatically perceive that form with bulk or mass.</td><td>论意念有没有具体为物质，都会感知到体积或质量。每当你接触某个特定的意念形式，而这只会发生在投射中，那时你就会自动感知那个具有体积或质量的形式。</td></tr><tr><td>In other systems the same energy idea will be transformed in a different way entirely, even as the physical objects within your universe are perceived in entirely different ways to others not within your system. Any given physical object exists in the manner in which you are accustomed to perceiving it. This (Jane struck the arm of the rocker in which she sat) for example exists as a chair. It also exists as sound. It has a counterpart that can, under given conditions, be perceived exclusively in terms of any of your senses.</td><td>在其他系统中，相同的能量意念将以完全不同的方式转化，甚至就像不在你系统之内的其他存在体以完全不同的方式感知你们宇宙之内的实物那样。任何既定的实物都以你惯常感知它的方式存在。例如这个(珍敲了她所坐的摇椅扶手一下)是以椅子的形式存在。它也以声音的形式存在。它有一个从你的任何感官来说，可以在既定条件下感知到的对等物。</td></tr><tr><td>You can hear the chair as a musical note in a trance state, for example, or with the use of drugs. You are still dealing in terms of your senses, however. You are seeing or perceiving, ratherseparately, the various components that are usually organized to form the solid object.</td><td>比方说，你在出神状态或使用药物时，可以听见如同一个音符的椅子。但是，你还是用你的感官在跟它打交道。你正在个别看或感知各种不同的成分，这些成分通常被组织起来，形成实体物件。</td></tr><tr><td>With the full use of the inner senses, however, it is theoretically possible to perceive all the shapes and forms that have ever been, or will ever be, adopted by the atoms and molecules that compose the particular chair. This kind of experience is beyond the power of drugs. It is true to say that in one sense both you and Ruburt are a part of the table and the chair, and the room in which they sit.</td><td>然而，在充分利用内在感官的情况下，理论上来说是可以感知构成特定椅子的原子和分子曾经或将会采用的所有形状和形式。这种经验是毒品的作用无法企及的。就某种意义来说，你和鲁柏真的都是桌子和椅子以及它们所有房间的一部分。</td></tr><tr><td>You organize yourselves out of other matter, you see. The difference is a psychic one, and not a physical one as it appears. The inner identity extends itself over larger and larger groups of energy forms, and acts as an overall psychic pattern. But all is connected.</td><td>你看，你们用其他物质把自己组织起来。其中的差别是一种心灵的差别，而不是它外表看起来的一种物质差别。内在本体扩展到越来越大群的能量形式，具有整体心灵模式的作用。但全部都是连结的。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Projections further extend the self and the identity, only this time in realms where the physical self cannot follow. Now this kind of projection, this extension of identity, is the true nature and the creative aspect of aggression.</td><td>现在。投射进一步扩展了自己和本体，只不过这次是在自己无法跟随的界域。现在这种投射，这种本体的扩展，就是攻击性的真实本质和创造面向。</td></tr><tr><td>This and not war, is the meaning of aggression. It is a forward thrust of creative activity, forever extending itself in this manner, and instantly changed, and no longer what it was.</td><td>这才是攻击性的意义，而不是战争。它是创造活动的向前冲刺，永远以这种方式扩展它自己，而立即改变，不再是过去的它。</td></tr><tr><td>Projection then is aggression. The self thrusts forward into new dimensions, and this is creative. Painting a picture is aggressive. You are thrusting energy into new forms. All this you see implies a destruction, but only in your limited terms.</td><td>所以投射就是攻击。自己向前冲刺，进入新的维度，而且这是创造性的冲刺。画一幅画是具有攻击性的。你正把能量推进新的形式里。你看，这一切全都意味着破坏，但只是从你们有限的角度来看。</td></tr><tr><td>Each projection, for example, is the death, in one way, of the limited self that stood earlier.</td><td>例如，每次投射都是之前所是的有限自己在某方面的死亡。</td></tr><tr><td>Each painting that you create represents the death of the self that you were before you created it. The changing self forever dies in this manner, and yet only this symbolic death insures psychic survival. There is no basic moral problem then when you consider the true nature of aggression, for it is highly creative, and without destruction there would be no existence. These are two faces of the same coin.</td><td>你创作的每一幅画都代表着你在创作它之前所是的那个自己的死亡。变动不居的自己永远都是以这种方式死去，但是唯有这种象征性的死亡才能确保心灵的存活。所以当你思考攻击性的真实本质时，没有任何基本的道德问题，因为它具有高度的创造性，而且没有破坏就不会有存在。这是同一枚硬币的两面。</td></tr><tr><td>Are your fingers tired?</td><td>你的手指累不累？</td></tr><tr><td>(“No.” 9:35.)</td><td>(“不累。”9:35分。)</td></tr><tr><td>A projection, an out-of-body experience, is a creative act, and again all creative acts are basically aggressive. Now, you change those dimensions in which your projections take place. You cannot visit them and leave no mark.</td><td>投射，出体经验，是一种创造行为，而且再一次，所有的创造行为基本上都具有攻击性。现在，你改变你的投射所在的维度。你不可能去过那些维度而不留下痕迹。</td></tr><tr><td>The ego, as a rule, is frightfully leery of such action, since to it an out-of body experience always symbolizes physical death. At the same time the ego becomes more assured after successful projections, since ir discovers itself not only intact but immeasurably enriched. Indeed, the ego both fights, fears and desires any creative act. Any creative act, including the production of any art, necessitates a momentary release from the ego, an escape from it, which the ego fears.</td><td>一般来说，自我对这样的行为是戒慎恐惧的，因为对它来说，出体经验永远象征着肉体的死亡。同时，在成功投射之后，自我变得更有自信，因为它发现自己不仅完整无缺而且还充实到无法估量的程度。事实上，自我对于任何创造行为都是既抗拒、恐惧又渴望。任何创造行为，包括任何艺术的创作在内，都需要暂时摆脱自我，逃离自我，这就是自我害怕的事。</td></tr><tr><td>Yet again, the ego is enriched and therefore allows the self more freedom.</td><td>但是，再一次，自我因此变得充实，而允许自己更加自由。</td></tr><tr><td>Successful projections therefore will ultimately lead to more projections, and they will be more easily executed.</td><td>所以，成功的投射最终会导致更多投射，而且更容易执行。</td></tr><tr><td>For the benefit of your fingers, we should perhaps take a break, though we are doing very well. We will leave our friend as he is.</td><td>尽管我们进行得很顺利，但为了你的手指好，我们还是应该休息一下。我们就让我们的朋友保持原状。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Okay.”</td><td>(“好的。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:40. As she had done during the 274th session Jane remained in trance at break. This didn’t mean she confined herself to her chair, sitting with her eyes closed. Instead she too paced about the room, her eyes open and very dark, and spoke to me as I stretched. We discussed briefly the similarity between projections and my paintings. She lit a cigarette and said shed let me tell her when I was ready to resume.</td><td>(9:40休息。和她在第274节的情况一样，珍在休息时停留在出神状态。这并不是说她闭着眼睛坐着，在椅子上一动也不动。正好相反，她也在房间里踱步，睁着眼睛，颜色非常深，而且在我伸懒腰的时候还跟我说话。我们简短讨论了投射与我的画之间的相似性。她点了一支烟，并且说等我准备要继续时，再告诉她。</td></tr><tr><td>(Her manner bad been quite active and expressive during delivery, her eyes open more often than not. She had smoked and sipped wine.

When you create physical matter you are not aware of doing so, but you affect energy directly in such an execution, your own attention being focused primarily in the physical system.</td><td>现在，你看，当你画一幅画时，你用你的肉体作为创造内在意念的工具。当你创造实体物质时，你没有觉察到自己这样做，但是你在这样的实际行为中直接影响能量，你自己的注意力主要集中在物质系统内。</td></tr><tr><td>You can only do so much in your painting. You can only create it as a reality in so many dimensions. You cannot appreciate, for that matter, all the systems of reality in which the painting does have reality. This is a very simple analogy:</td><td>你在你的绘画中只能做这么多。你只能在这么多的维度里创造它的实相。就此而言，你无法领会这幅画确实在其中拥有实相的所有实相系统。这是一个非常简单的比喻；</td></tr><tr><td>However, in some aspects a projection to another system could be likened to a situation in which you entered the landscape of one of your own paintings.</td><td>但是，在某些方向，投射到另一个系统，可以比作是你进入你自己的一幅画中景观之内。</td></tr><tr><td>(One of our cats now scratched at the hall door for admittance as is customary.</td><td>(此时照惯例，我们的一只猫抓着走廊的门，想要进来。</td></tr><tr><td>Without pausing her eyes open and dark Jane rose and went to the door and let the cat in.

You would be different from the inhabitants who you might encounter there. But in one way or another your existence would be perceived.</td><td>你在其中拥有的自由就这么多，没有更多了。你和你可能会在那里遇到的居民是不一样的。但不管怎样，你的存在都会被感知到。</td></tr><tr><td>Now. Most systems have more reality than a painting, but not all of them.</td><td>现在。大多数系统的实相比画作多，但不是全部都是。</td></tr><tr><td>The very nature of some would be frightening to you. Your paintings are a creation, and yet by their nature they are limitations. They are limitations because their reality is necessarily limited by the elements you have chosen. You paint one house within a landscape for example. This is a creation. But two houses will never appear.</td><td>有一些系统的本质对你来说会很可怕。你的画作是一种创造，但就其本质而言，它们是限制。它们之所以是限制，因为它们的实相必然受限于你选择的元素。例如，你在景观内画了一间房子。这是一个创造。但是两间房子永远不会出现。</td></tr><tr><td>Now in the realities of other systems another house, you see, could appear (smile) and another person could appear, and the projecting consciousness would be such a person. He must instantly adapt to the new surroundings.</td><td>现在，你们看，在另一个系统的实相中，另一所房子可能会出现(微笑)并且另一个人也可能会出现，并且投射的意识就会是这样的一个人。他必须立即适应新环境。</td></tr><tr><td>Now.

To me a reference to some shape, dark and narrow with the feeling of motion involved, as a falling through or a falling out. Downward motion, with some speed.” The sewing room of my mother is a legitimate connection. We aren’t so sure of Seth’s interpretation^ unless it pertains to the motion of the sewing machine. Could the dark and narrow’ etc.” be another grave or illness reference?</td><td>(第二个问题:“你能不能详细说明壁橱资料？”“鲁柏想到你母亲的缝纫室。对我来说，这是指某个形状，又黑又窄，带有运动的感觉，像是掉落下去或掉落出来。向下的运动，有一定的速度。”我母亲的缝纫室是一个合情合理的关联。我们对赛斯的解读不太确定，除非它与缝纫机的运转有关。黑暗和狭窄等等有没有可能又是指坟墓或疾病？</td></tr><tr><td>(3rd Question: “What’s that about a black cat?” UA distant connection. [Pause.] A loss of an advantage, or period of poor luck.” See the explanation’re the black cat on page 328. Seth's additional data here conjures up the thought that the neighbor’s black cat also serves as the classic symbol of bad or poor luck; the connection here being the failing health of my father and the failing health in a more drastic way of Mr. Meeker, the father-in-law of my brother Loren. It was while at Lorens that my mother sent us the greeting card. When she called us on August 14, she, of course, discussed the health both of my father and Mr. Meeker.</td><td>(第三个问题:“一只黑猫是什么意思？”“遥远的关联。失去优势或运气不佳的时期。”见前面黑猫的解读。这里赛斯的补充资料让人想到邻居的黑猫也是运气很差或不好的典型象征；这里的关联是我父亲的健康状况不佳，以及我弟弟洛伦的岳父米克尔先生[Meeker]更加急遽恶化的健康。我母亲是在洛伦家的时候，寄了问候卡给我们。当她在8月14日打电话给我们时，当然讨论了我父亲和米克尔先生两人的健康状况。</td></tr><tr><td>(4th Question: “What's the shape of the object?” “Roughly rectangular, in itself.yt Correct.

Seth’s answer here is a good reference to the note Mother wrote inside the greeting card. It can actually apply just as well to the envelope object itself. The phone call on August 14 from my mother concerned a visit by us to Sayre, and one by her to us in Elmira. During this call arrangements were made for her to visit us here next weekend’ on Saturday, August 20.</td><td>(第7个问题:“你能不能告诉我，物件上的手写字是写什么？”“根本不是邀请，而是指一个场合或拜访？”我认为可以提出这个问题，因为赛斯已经提到与资料有关的手写字。这里赛斯的答案贴切地指出我母亲写在问候卡里面的短信。它其实也适用于信封物件本身。8月14日我母亲打来电话和我们去塞尔市探望她一次，以及她来过埃尔迈拉看我们一次有关。在这通电话中，我们安排她下个周末，8月20日星期六，来这里探望我们。</td></tr><tr><td>(8th Question: “Was that word you mentioned Ensenada?” “An incident primarily involving four people I believe. This is in continued answer to your previous question. ’’ This data seems to emphasize the first of the two possibilities mentioned in the 7th Question. The four people thus, presumably, would be my parents, and my brother and his wife in Tunkhannock.</td><td>(第8个问题:“你提到的那个词是不是恩塞纳达？”“我相信是一个主要涉及4个人的事件。这是继续回答你之前的问题。”这个资料似乎强调第7个问题提到的两个可能性当中的第一个。因此，4个人想必是我父母以及在特和纳的我弟弟和他太太。</td></tr><tr><td>(9th Question: “Well why don’t you tell me something about the four people?” “These are further general impressions. An S. Perhaps a C. The object a card with a note. An out-of-town connection” As can be seen Seth did not answer the last two questions directly. A connection with S? Perhaps Sayre, my parents home...

His past indispositions, from an overall viewpoint, have been most necessary and beneficial. You cannot afford to keep knowledge at an intellectual level, and not use it practically, for when you do so it is useless to you. His indispositions taught him this is a way that he will not forget. His inner and unthinking reactions literally immobilized him.</td><td>我们一开始说鲁柏。从整体的角度来看，他过去的不适是很有必要也是很有益的。把知识保留在智力层面上，而不是实际使用它的后果是你承担不起的，因为当你这样做的时候，它对你来说毫无用处。他的不适让他领悟到这是他不会忘记的一种方式。他内在不假思索的反应确实让他动弹不得。</td></tr><tr><td>This immobilization was in itself a lesson, and he has learned it. He conquered mentally and emotionally, and therefore he conquered finally in physical terms. The immobile foot was a direct translation of the following: “ I am exhausted and I will go no further at this point.” The exhaustion was a natural result of his own reactions. He is fond of saying that if you cannot control events, you can control your reactions. He did not do so well here, however, and he is considering only a half-truth in the above statement.</td><td>这种动弹不得本身就是一个教训，而他已经学到了。在心智上和情感上，他都克服了，因此最终在物质方面他也克服了。动弹不得的双脚是以下这句话的直译：“我精疲力竭，现在我一步都走不了。”精疲力竭是他自己反应造成的自然结果。他喜欢说，如果你无法控制事件，你就无法控制你的反应。然而，他这里做得不太好，而且在上面那句话当中，他只考虑到一半的事实。</td></tr><tr><td>Actually reactions to events do control other events. You see what I mean here. The hip was simply a panic reaction. It was also the result of negative suggestion given by your chiropractor. There are ways of protecting yourself. You know them, and must use them.</td><td>实际上对事件的反应确实控制其他事件。你明白我这里的意思。髋关节只是一种恐慌反应。这也是你的整脊师的负面暗示造成的结果。保护你自己的方法是有的。你知道那些方法，而且一定要使用它们。</td></tr><tr><td>Fortunately Ruburt benefited, for he learned. I have given you important and practical suggestions concerning health measures, and I take it for granted that you use them.</td><td>幸运的是鲁柏从中受益，因为他学到了教训。关于健康的准绳，我已经给你许多重要又实用的建议，我理所当然认为你会好好利用。</td></tr><tr><td>(Once again one of our cats scratched at the door for admittance. As she has done before Jane got up while speaking’ and without interrupting her delivery let the cat in. She then sat back down.)</td><td>(再一次我们的一只猫又在抓门，想要进来。和她边讲话边起身之前做的那样，她在没有中断传述的同时，开门让猫进来。然后她再坐下来。)</td></tr><tr><td>Again, I did not foresee this difficulty. And again, your purposes will be served if you make a habit in our sessions of asking me to check into immediate probabilities as far as health is concerned.</td><td>再一次，我没有预见到这个难题。而且再一次，如果你在我们的课中养成一个习惯，也就是要求我立即检查健康方面的可能性，那么你的目的就会达成。</td></tr><tr><td>It is a matter of focus on my part. If the overall developments are not dangerous, I will not automatically sense them, but only the end result. On Ruburts part this time it was additional knowledge. Specific questions will cause me to turn my attention to such matters.</td><td>在我这边，这是焦点的问题。如果整体的发展没有危险，我就不会自动感应它们。而只会感应最终的结果。这次在鲁柏那边是学到了额外的知识。具体问题将会促使我把注意力转到这样的问题上。</td></tr><tr><td>We can then change the probabilities, or manipulate them to your advantage.</td><td>然后，我们就能够改变可能性，或是操纵它们，变成对你是有利的。</td></tr><tr><td>It many cases proper suggestions given immediately may well suffice. You cannot expect however a steady and unchanging state of exuberant happiness.</td><td>在很多情况下，立刻给予适当的暗示可能就够了。但是，你不能预期快乐洋溢的状态稳定不变。</td></tr><tr><td>(Smile.) It is nor practical in your terms. You would learn nothing, or very little.</td><td>(微笑)就你而言，这是不切实际的。你会什么都学不到，或学到很少。</td></tr><tr><td>In the main physical existence means a translation of inner mood and psychological climate into physical terms, and no consciousness is constantly in a state of bliss. There is always effort involved, for this is the meaning of consciousness.</td><td>在主要的物质存在中，意思是把内在情绪和心理气候转化为物质，而且没有任何意识一直不断处于幸福安乐的状态。</td></tr><tr><td>It is the meaning of creative effort. You should not accept a barrage of illness as natural, however, for it is not. On the other hand neither should you blame yourselves for various small and separated indispositions.</td><td>永远都要努力，因为这就是意识的意义。这就是创造性努力的意义。你们不应该把接二连三生病当成是自然的事，因为它不是。另一方面，你们也不应该因为种种个别的小小不适而责怪自己。</td></tr><tr><td>In a state of excellent health there will still be small, infrequent but definite indispositions. You can be sure of adequate protection if you daily suggest that you will be open to constructive and healthful suggestions and influences.</td><td>在健康状况良好的状态下，仍然会有一些不常有但是明确的小小不适。如果你每天暗示你开放接受建设性又有益健康的暗示和影响，那你一定能够得到足够的保护。</td></tr><tr><td>Also suggest that you will be automatically protected against negative suggestions and influences.</td><td>此外也要暗示你自动受到保护，免于负面暗示和影响的伤害。</td></tr><tr><td>It is important that influences also be included.</td><td>把影响包含在内很重要。</td></tr><tr><td>We will rest whenever you prefer, Joseph.</td><td>约瑟，你想要什么时候休息，我们就休息。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Go ahead for a while., , 9:29.)</td><td>(“再继续一会。”9:29。)</td></tr><tr><td>Now.

You can command yourself protection from such viruses through the suggestions given earlier. You may rest.</td><td>当然，有些伤害已经造成了。你可以透过之前给的建议来保护自己免受这类病毒的侵害。你可以休息了。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane paused while I sneezed.)</td><td>(在我打喷嚏时，珍停顿了一下。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will have a short session if you prefer, for your convenience.</td><td>如果你愿意，我们就上一节短课，看你方便。</td></tr><tr><td>(“No, Im all right. Please continue.)</td><td>(“不，我没事。请继续。”)</td></tr><tr><td>The suggestions mentioned, had you used them consistently, would have changed your own reactions to the Miss Callahan incidents, and allowed you greater freedom. Not only did the incidents upset you, but unwittingly you prevented Ruburt himself from giving some aid in the later stages that he could have provided.</td><td>已经提到的暗示，如果你一直使用它们，就会改变你对卡拉汉小姐事件的反应，而让你有更大的自由。这些事件不仅使你感到不安，而且在不知不觉中你还阻止鲁柏自己给予他本来在后阶段可以提供的一些帮助。</td></tr><tr><td>It was your reactions that should have been changed, as it was Ruburts reactions concerning his book that should have been changed. His attitude toward his book and publisher largely were responsible for the delays.</td><td>这是你应该改变的反应，就像鲁柏应该改变他对自己的书产生的反应。他对自己的书和出版商的态度在很大程度上是造成延迟的原因。</td></tr><tr><td>You should have made a positive and enlightened effort to help Miss Callahan, once you realized your predicament. If you had done so, dear friend, you would not have become ill. And this material is quite undistorted.</td><td>一旦你认识到自己的困境，就应该会以积极又开明的方式努力帮助卡拉汉小姐。要是你这样做，亲爱的朋友，你就不会生病了。这个资料几乎没有扭曲。</td></tr><tr><td>Help those you are free to help. It will make up for many things.</td><td>帮助那些你可以自由提供帮助的人。这将会弥补很多事情。</td></tr><tr><td>Now you may take a more relaxing rest.</td><td>现在你可以放松休息一下。</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 9:39.

She likened the experience to manipulated dream images; none of them had bothered her.</td><td>(9:39休息。珍说，她相当顺利出离。她真的不知道她放猫进来，直到她回到椅子上。她把这个经验比作被操纵的梦意象；它们全都没有干扰到她。</td></tr><tr><td>(Her pace had become quite active, her eyes open often; she had smoked and sipped wine.

The particular kind you are using is not good in your particular circumstances.</td><td>在你的情况下，动物毛不是一个刺激物，但是过去一些和你母亲有关的联想可能会让你这么想。加了香水的肥皂应该换成另一种香皂。在你的特定状况中，你用的那一种不好。</td></tr><tr><td>These instructions apply only during hay fever season. In your room keep some cotton in a saucer. The cotton to be saturated with ink. The ink will draw certain alloids from the atmosphere of the house. The cotton should be daily discarded and a new piece put in its place.</td><td>这些指示仅适用于花粉热季节。在你的房间里，把一些棉花放在碟子里。棉花要用墨水浸透。墨水会从房子的大气中吸收某些alloid。棉花应该要每天丢弃，在它的位置上放一团新的棉花。</td></tr><tr><td>These measures will greatly benefit you, but they would not be necessary if you conquered the condition from the subjective end. Now you have not asked me, but if you give me a moment I will look into your probable health situation, and see what we find.</td><td>这些措施对你会有很大的好处，但如果你从主观这一头克服这个状况，就没有必要采取这些措施了。现在你没有问我，但如果你给我一点时间，我会深入探查你可能的健康状况，看看我们会发现什么。</td></tr><tr><td>(Long pause, eyes closed, at 9:57.)</td><td>(长时间停顿，眼睛闭着。9:57。)</td></tr><tr><td>If you go to your landlords, do not use the apples if they are given to you.</td><td>如果你去你的房东家，要是他们给你苹果的话，</td></tr><tr><td>You will not break down the acids in them properly, judging from past performance.</td><td>不要吃。从过去的表现判断，你无法适当分解苹果里的酸。如果你遵循我的建议，运用你知道的方法，你应该就会有一个症状非常轻微的花粉热季节。</td></tr><tr><td>If you follow my suggestions and use what you know, then you should have a very light hay fever season. If you do an excellent job of it, then you would experience no symptoms.</td><td>如果你做得非常之好，你就不会有任何症状。</td></tr><tr><td>I do not see any too-annoying symptoms in any case. Ruburt is clear also.</td><td>无论如何，我都没有看到任何太过烦人的症状。鲁柏也没有。</td></tr><tr><td>He frightened himself into some sense. During hay fever season Ruburt should use a diluted (underlined) ammonia household cleaner.</td><td>他有点把自己吓到变理智了。在花粉热的季节，鲁柏应该使用稀释(划线)的家用含氨清洁剂。</td></tr><tr><td>When possible a window facing the north should be opened in your room, in the morning particularly. These past episodes, again, have been beneficial to you both. You are quite correct, Joseph. You ended your illness however not twice as quickly, but three times as quickly, as it would have been otherwise.</td><td>如果可能的话，你们房间里面向北方的窗户应该打开，尤其是早上。再一次，这些过去的事件对你们两个都有好处。你是对的，约瑟，因为这样，所以你终止自己病程的速度不是快了两倍，而是三倍。</td></tr><tr><td>Now Ruburt utilized his abilities in helping you, but he did not mobilize them with any vigor in helping himself, until panic drove him to do so.</td><td>现在鲁柏利用他的能力帮助你，但他没有努力让这些能力动员起来帮助自己，直到恐慌驱使他这样做。</td></tr><tr><td>I have told you that his book will sell well— very well, and so it shall.</td><td>我已经告诉过你，他的书将会卖得很好——非常好，所以它就是会卖得非常好。</td></tr><tr><td>If the Wollheim meeting takes place, it will prove highly beneficial to all parties concerned, but at a later date and at a time when it will be highly needed.</td><td>如果真的和韦翰见到面，事实将会证明这件事对所有相关的人都非常有益，但是时间是在以后，以及需要它的时候。</td></tr><tr><td>The association will continue, and in other places. Within I believe three years there will be a much closer and significant relationship between the two families.</td><td>这个结盟将会持续下去，而且是在其他地方。我相信在三年内，两个家庭之间将会建立更加紧密而且影响深远的关系。</td></tr><tr><td>I have taken this session to give you healthful suggestions. Take advantage of them. There seems to be something about a Wednesday, significant within I believe a month, but I cannot pin it down.</td><td>我利用这一节给你有益健康的建议。好好利用它们。我相信一个月内好像有某件和星期三有关的事，具有重要的意义，但我无法确定。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburt should wash his dust mop.</td><td>鲁柏应该洗一洗他的除尘拖把。</td></tr><tr><td>Stay away also, Joseph, from peanut butter, for a while only. You may take a break, or end the session as you prefer.</td><td>还有远离花生酱，约瑟，只要一阵子就好。你可以休息一下，或是你比较想要结束这一节也可以。</td></tr><tr><td>(“Well we can take the break. ’’</td><td>(“嗯，我们可以休息一下。”</td></tr><tr><td>(Break at 10:15. Jane had been well dissociated. A t firs t she could remember nothing except the last sentence or two she had delivered; then bits of the material began to return. Her pace had been good her eyes open often, etc.</td><td>(10:15休息。珍顺利出离。起初她什么都记不得，除了她最后传述的一两句话以外；然后才开始回想起一段段资料。她的速度很好，眼睛经常张开等等。</td></tr><tr><td>(At break we tried looking up the word “alloid” in the dictionary, without success.</td><td>(在休息时，我们试过在字典里查找“alloid”这个字，但没有查到。</td></tr><tr><td>Nor did approximations yield anything. I was sure of the word Jane had given t as far as sound goes, although my spelling was phonetic. We thought Seth would comment later.</td><td>类似的字也没有产生任何结果。我确定珍给出的是这个字，就发音来说，但我是用拼音拼出这个字。我们认为赛斯稍后会发表评论。</td></tr><tr><td>(Jane resumed in the same manner at 10:25.)</td><td>(珍以同样的方式继续。10:25。)</td></tr><tr><td>We will shortly close.</td><td>我们很快就要结束。</td></tr><tr><td>The difficulties over the word have to do with Ruburts vocabulary. The word I mean is one connected with trace minerals of metallic base.</td><td>在这个字上面遇到的困难和鲁柏的词汇有关。我要用的字和金属基质的微量矿物质有关联。</td></tr><tr><td>There is an interchange of acids between metallic traces. During the season you do not utilize some acids properly, and excesses sometimes build up.</td><td>在微量金属之间有酸类的交换。在这个季节里，你没有适当利用一些酸类，有时候过量的酸类会累积。</td></tr><tr><td>The ink arrangement takes care of these.</td><td>摆放墨水棉花可以吸收这些酸类。</td></tr><tr><td>(Long pause’ eyes closed.) I am quiet simply because I am searching for future suggestions here. Do not drink milk in your parents' home, particularly at this time. Cottage cheese is advisable to replace other cheeses.</td><td>(长时间停顿，闭着眼睛)我之所以不出声，是因为这里我正寻找一些对未来的建议，避免在你父母家喝牛奶，特别是这段时间。建议以茅屋起司代替其他的起司。</td></tr><tr><td>Your Formosan tea is excellent for you. Avoid orange pekoe for now.</td><td>你的台湾茶非常适合你。目前避免使用橙色白毫等级(orange pekoe)的红茶。</td></tr><tr><td>Our next session will be concerned with the discussion which we earlier began, rather than with personal concerns. I suggest however that you make a habit of questioning me concerning health probabilities as you go along.</td><td>我们下一节将会关注我们之前开始的讨论，而不是个人问题。不过，我建议你养成一个习惯，在你继续时，问我一些和健康的可能性有关的问题。</td></tr><tr><td>Ruburts ankle was sprained originally in your home. A very simple sprain,</td><td>鲁柏的脚踝原本是在你家里扭伤的。</td></tr><tr><td>suffered in the kitchen. It was mending nicely until the evening at your dancing establishment, when it was again bruised. He kept on dancing however, a mistake.</td><td>一个非常简单的扭伤，事故地点是厨房。它复原得不错，直到晚上在你们的跳舞场所，它又再次挫伤。但是，他却继续跳舞，这是个错误的举动。</td></tr><tr><td>(“How did Jane sprain it in the kitchen?”)</td><td>(“珍是怎么在厨房扭伤的？”)</td></tr><tr><td>I believe moving the refrigerator out to clean. The weight was poorly distributed.</td><td>我相信是在把冰箱移出来清洁的时候。重量分布不均。</td></tr><tr><td>It is now on the mend, and he should experience no further difficulties.</td><td>它现在正在好转中，而且他应该不会再遇到任何困难了。</td></tr><tr><td>He should automatically now give himself the suggestions mentioned in this session, before he reads a letter from his mother. This alone will save him from many indispositions. Your cat should be inoculated. There is no great danger here, but since you know he is not inoculated, it should be done. Do you have any questions?</td><td>在读他母亲寄来的一封信之前，他现在应该自动给自己这一节提到的暗示。光是这一点，就可以让他免于很多不适。你的猫应该接受预防接种。这里没有什么很大的危险，但是因为你知道它没有打过预防针，所以应该带它去打。你有任何问题吗？</td></tr><tr><td>(“What did you think of my dream experience involving the back windows of the studio? Did this involve a projection?” See my dream notebook for August 20J966.)</td><td>(“你怎样看待我那个和工作室后窗有关的梦经验？这是否涉及投射？”见我于1966年8月20日的梦笔记。)</td></tr><tr><td>It was indeed, as you suspected; you were afraid to carry on however. It could have been quite interesting. Ruburts sudden propulsions, so far, have saved him from having to make that kind of decision, you see. All in all you did well. There is no rush. All of those dreams, grouped during your illness, were projections, and the result of suggestion. If you have no more questions, we will end our session.</td><td>确实，正如你的怀疑；你不敢继续。它本来可能相当有趣。到目前为止，你看，鲁柏的突然推进使他不必作出那种决定。总而言之，你做得很好。不用着急。在你生病期间集聚的那些梦全部都是投射，也是暗示的结果。如果你没有其他问题，我们就要结束这一节。</td></tr><tr><td>(“ I guess not.”)</td><td>(“我想没有了。”)</td></tr><tr><td>My heartiest regards. And to Ruburt my congratulations on his book.</td><td>我最诚挚的问候。还有我恭喜鲁柏出新书了。</td></tr><tr><td>(“You’re in it.”)</td><td>(“你就在书中。”)</td></tr><tr><td>I am indeed. (Smile eyes closed.) I am its inspiration.</td><td>我确实是。(微笑，闭着眼睛)我是它的灵感。</td></tr><tr><td>(End at 10:42. Jane was again far-out. Eyes open at times’ etc.)</td><td>(10:42结束。珍再次出去很远。有时候睁开眼睛等等。)</td></tr><table border="1">
