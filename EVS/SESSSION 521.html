<div style="display:inline">(珍开始以普通的声音说话，速度适中，很少停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane began speaking in an average voice, at a good pace with few pauses.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在，晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now, good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们现在要开始我们的下一章。我相信是第四章。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>We will now begin our next chapter. It is, I believe, Chapter Four.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“是的。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Yes.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们自己的环境所包括的远比你们可能假设的要广得多。早先我说到你们的环境，只就你们日常的物质生存及目前有关的事物而言。实际上，对你们更大、更广的环境你们所知甚少。设想你目前的自己是戏里的演员——这难说是个新的比喻，却是合适的比喻——背景是二十世纪，你和每个其他的参与者创造了道具、布景与主题；事实是，你们编写、制作并演出整出戏。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your own environment includes far more than you may have supposed. Earlier I referred to your environment in terms of the daily physical existence and surroundings with which you are currently connected. In actuality, you are aware of very little of your larger, more extensive environment. Consider your present self as an actor in a play; hardly a new analogy, but a suitable one. The scene is set in the twentieth century. You create the props, the settings, the themes; in fact you write, produce, and act in the entire production ---- you and every other individual who takes part.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，你如此聚焦于你的角色中；如此被你所创造的实相吸引，如此被你的特定角色的问题、挑战、希望与忧伤所迷，竟忘了他们是你自己的创作。这出感人至深的戏，及其他所有的喜怒哀乐，可与你的目前生活、目前环境相比拟，不论是在个人或全体来说。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You are so focused in your roles, however; so intrigued by the reality that you have created, so entranced by the problems, challenges, hopes, and sorrows of your particular roles that you have forgotten they are of your own creation. This intensely moving drama, with all its joys and tragedies, can be compared with your present life, your present environment, both individually and en masse.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">但同时还有其他的戏在上演，在其中你也有角色要演。这些戏各有其背景及道具，而且在不同的时期发生。一个也许叫作“十二世纪的生活”，一个也许叫作“十八世纪的生活”，或“在纪元前五世纪”，或“在纪元三千年”。你同样也创造了这些戏剧，而且在其中扮演角色。这些背景也代表了你的环境，环绕着你的整体人格的环境。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>But there are other plays going on simultaneously, in which you also have a part to play. These have their own scenery, their own props. They take place in different periods of time. One may be called “Life in the twelfth century A.D.” One may be called “Life in the eighteenth century,” or “in 500 B.C.,” or “in A.D. 3000.” You also create these plays and act in them. These settings also represent your environment, the environment that surrounds your entire personality.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，我说的是参与这“时代戏”的这个部分的你；而你整体人格的这特定部分是如此地沉浸于这场戏中，竟不知你同时还在演其他的戏。你不了解自己的多次元实相；因此当我告诉你你在同时过着许多不同的生活时，仿佛是很奇怪或不可思议。你很难想象同时身处两个地方，更别说同时身处两个或更多个不同的时代或世纪里。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I am speaking of the portion of you who is taking part in this particular period piece, however; and that particular portion of your entire personality is so focused within this drama that you are not aware of the others in which you also play a role. You do not understand your own multidimensional reality; therefore it seems strange or unbelievable when I tell you that you live many existences at one time. It is difficult for you to imagine being in two places at once, much less in two or more times, or centuries.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:24停顿。)现在简单地说，时间并非一连串的片刻。你所说的话，所做的动作，似乎是在时间里发生，就像椅子或桌子似乎占据了空间。但是这些表象是你“预先”布置好的复杂道具的一部分，而在剧中你必须接受这些并视以为真。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 9:24.) Now stated simply, time is not a series of moments. The words that you speak, the acts that you perform, appear to take place in time, as a chair or table appears to take up space. These appearances however are a part of the complicated props that you have set up “beforehand,” and within the play you must accept these as real.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">且让我拿“下午四点”作个近便的例子。你可以对一位朋友说：“我下午四点和你街角见。”或在饭店见，喝杯酒、聊聊天或吃顿饭，你的朋友就会很精确地知道他在何时何地能找到你。这件事会发生，虽然“下午四点”并没有基本上的意义，只是一个经过协定的指定——如果你喜欢，可称为君子协定。再举例说，如果你在晚上九点去看戏，但戏中的情节是在晨间发生的，而演员们正在吃早餐，你便接受戏里所指的时间，也假装那是早上。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Four o’clock in the afternoon is a very handy reference. You can say to a friend, “I will meet you at four o’clock at the corner,” or at a restaurant, for a drink or a chat or a meal, and your friend will know precisely where and when he will find you. This will happen despite the fact that four o’clock in the afternoon has no basic meaning, but is an agreed-upon designation ---- a gentlemen’s agreement, if you prefer. If you attend the theatre at nine o’clock in the evening, but the actions of the play take place within the morning hours, and the actors are shown eating breakfast, you accept the time as given within the theatre’s play. You also pretend that it is morning.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们每个人现在都参与了一个大得多的演出，在其中你们都同意某些基本假设，作为戏能在其中发生的架构。那些假设是：时间是一个接一个的一连串片刻；有个客观的世界存在，非由你们自己创造，也不受你们知觉的影响；你们被束缚在你们所穿戴的皮囊之内；以及你们是受时空限制的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Each of you are now involved in a much larger production, in which you all agree on certain basic assumptions that serve as a framework within which the play can occur. The assumptions are that time is a series of moments one after another; that an objective world exists quite independently of your own creation and perception of it; that you are bound within the physical bodies that you have donned; and that you are limited by time and space.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:35。)为了同样的理由，你们接受的其他假设包括：所有的感知是经肉体感官而来；换句话说，所有的资讯来自外界，没有资讯来自内心。因此你被迫全神贯注于戏里的活动。现在这些形形色色的戏，这些创造性的时代剧就代表你所谓 “转世的人生”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:35.) Other assumptions accepted for the same reason include the idea that all perception comes through your physical senses; in other words, that all information comes from without, and that no information can come from within. You therefore are forced to focus intensely upon the actions of the play. Now these various plays, these creative period pieces represent what you would call reincarnational lives.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">基本上它们全都同时存在。那些仍然卷入这些所谓转世存在的极其复杂“激情剧研习会”的人们，发觉自己很难看破它们。有些人，可以比喻为在两次演出之间的休息期间，试着与那些仍在演出的人通讯；但他们自己只是在所谓的侧翼，也只能看得这么远。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They all exist basically at one time. Those who are still involved in these highly complicated passion-play seminars called reincarnational existences, find it difficult to see beyond them. Some, resting between productions, as it were, try to communicate with those who are still taking part; but they themselves are merely in the wings, so to speak, and can only see so far.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这些戏似乎是一出接一出地演，因此这些通讯似乎更加强了“时间是一连串的片刻，循着单线推移过去，从某个不可思议的开始到某个同样不可想象的结尾”这个错误的观念。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The plays seem to be taking place one before the other, and so these communications seem to intensify the false idea that time is a series of moments, passing in a single line from some inconceivable beginning to some equally inconceivable end.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你的手累了吗？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Are your fingers tired?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“不累。”时间为9:42。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“No.” It was 9:42.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这导致你们以为，不但就个人而言，而且就人类整体而言“进步”都极为有限。甚至连你们当中那些思考过转世的人，你想：“不错，人类由中世纪以来一定有进步，”虽然你极怕它并没有；或你转向技术上的进步，说道：“至少在那个方向我们已大有长进。”</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This leads you to think in terms of a very limited progress, both in individual terms and in terms of your species as a whole. You think, those of you who have even considered reincarnation, “Well, certainly the race must have progressed from the time of the Middle Ages,” although you greatly fear it has not; or you turn to technological progress and say, “At least we have come a long way in that direction.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">例如，你可以含着笑而自思：很难想象一个罗马元老院的议员用扩音器向大众演讲，而他的孩子看他在电视上表演。但所有这些想法都极易引人误入歧途。进步并不是以你所想的样子存在的，时间也不是。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may smile and think to yourself that it is quite difficult to imagine a Roman senator addressing the multitudes through a microphone, for example; his children, watching his performance on television. But all of this is highly misleading. Progress does not exist in the terms that you consider it to, any more than time does.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在每出戏里，对个人与全体而言，都设定了不同的难题。进步与否则以这些问题是以哪种方式获得解决或没获得解决来估量。在某些时期有伟大的进步。例如，伟大的分枝出现了，而以你的观点可能根本不把它当作是进步。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In each play, both individually and en masse, different problems are set up. Progress can be measured in terms of the particular ways in which those problems were solved or not solved. Great advances have been made in certain periods. For example, great offshoots appeared that from your viewpoint you might not consider progress at all.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可以休息。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:51。珍很快地回过神。她说：“哇！赛斯对那个还有许多话要说呢——我觉得它已满到这儿了。”她触触她的前额，“我时时会得到一大片我不能用语言表达的东西；你知道我的意思吗？但他将会为我们解析。”</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:51. Jane left trance quickly. “Wow,” she said, “Seth’s going to have an awful lot to say about that ---- I can feel it up here.” She touched her forehead. “Every so often I get a huge sweep of something that I can’t put into words; do you know what I mean? But he’s going to break it down for us.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(她继续说：“很奇怪，我今晚并不特别觉得灵通，但资料却很棒。那以前也发生过。当有我不喜欢的人在场，或由于某种理由他们使我不来劲，那我们就不会有一堂课——资料过不来。但当只有我们时，我不必感觉灵通，不管怎样资料就会过来，而且总是很棒的。”</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“It’s funny,” she continued, “I didn’t feel particularly psychic tonight but the material’s good. That’s happened before, too. When there’s someone here that I don’t like, or they turn me off for some reason, then we won’t have a session ---- the material won’t come through. But I don’t need to feel psychic when we’re here alone; the material just comes through no matter what, and it’s always good.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(珍以较慢的速度于10:15继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane resumed at a slower pace at 10:15.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：附带地说(幽默地)，你不需记录这个。我用“现在”开始一句话，常常只是告诉你该出场了的暗号，并不一定要与我们的稿本写在一起。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Incidentally (humorously), you need not record this. My “now’s,” beginning a sentence, are often simply cues to you, and need not necessarily go along with our script.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好，我知道了。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Okay, I understand.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：(幽默地较大声：)在有些戏里，一般地说，每个演员似乎都在努力解决一个较大问题的一小部分，而整出戏则是为解决那较大的问题。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now (humorously louder): in some plays, generally speaking, the actors are each working on a seemingly minute portion of a larger problem that the play itself is to resolve.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">虽然我在这儿用“戏剧”作个比喻，这些“戏”其实是极为即兴的事，演员在戏的架构之内有充分的自由，而认可了以上那些假设，并没有排演。如你在本书后面一些会看到的，是有观察员存在的。就如在任何好的戏剧产品一样，在每一出戏里都有一个全面的主题，例如：伟大的艺术家出现在某一特定的时代，并非只因他们生在其中，或(因)其条件优异。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Though I use the analogy here of a drama, these “plays” are highly spontaneous affairs in which the actors have full freedom within the play’s framework. And granting these assumptions that have been stated, there are no rehearsals. There are observers, as you will see later in our book. As in any good theatre production, there is an overall theme within each play. The great artists, for example, did not emerge out of a particular time simply because they were born into it, or (because) the conditions were favorable.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(照赛斯所说，每个人选择他的轮回里每一生的时间和地点。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(According to Seth, each individual chooses the time and place of every “life” in his reincarnational cycle.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那出戏的本身是关于“将直觉性的真理实现为你所谓的艺术形式”，其创造力产生如此庞然与全面性的效果，以致那戏本身会唤醒潜藏在每个演员之内的能力，并做为行为的典范。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The play itself was concerned with the actualization of intuitive truth into what you would call artistic form, with a creativity of such vast and sweeping results that it would serve to awaken latent abilities within each actor and to serve as a model of behavior.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">发生了精神上、艺术上或心灵上的复兴期，因为涉入戏中的那些人的强烈内在焦点被导向那些目的。每出戏的挑战也许不同，但其伟大的主题是所有意识的灯塔。它们是做为模范用的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Periods of renaissance ---- spiritual, artistic, or psychic ---- occur because the intense inner focus of those involved in the drama are directed toward those ends. The challenge may be different in each play, but the great themes are beacons to all consciousness. They serve as models.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:17。)你们可要知道，进步与时间毫不相关，而是与心灵或精神的焦点有关。每出戏与任何别的戏都完全不同，因此，假设你在此生的行为是由前生所引起，或你在今生为前生的罪过受罚是不对的。所有的人生都是同时的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:17.) Progress has nothing to do with time, you see, but with psychic and spiritual focus. Each play is entirely different from any other. It is not correct, therefore, to suppose that your actions in this life are caused by a previous existence, or that you are being punished in this life for crimes in a past one. The lives are simultaneous.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你自己多次元的人格具有这种天赋，它能拥有这些经验，而同时仍维持住它的身份。自然，它会受它所参与的各种不同的戏影响。如果你喜欢，可说是有一个即刻的沟通与即刻的回馈系统。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your own multidimensional personality is so endowed that it can have these experiences and still retain its identity. It is, of course, affected by the various plays in which it takes part. There is instant communication and an instant, if you prefer, feedback system.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这些戏剧并非漫无目的的。在这些戏里，多次元的人格经由自己的所作所为而学习。它尝试过数不清形形色色的姿势、行为模式、态度，结果也改变了别人。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>These plays are hardly without purpose. In them the multidimensional personality learns through its own actions. It tries out an endless variety of poses, behavior patterns, attitudes, and changes others as a result.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你要知道，“结果”这个字自动地暗示了原因与结果——因在果之前发生，而这只是这种扭曲的力量以及“语言性的思想”天生具有的困难之小小例子，因为它永远暗示了一个单线的描述。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The word “result,” you see, automatically infers cause and effect ---- the cause happening before the effect, and this is simply one small example of the strength of such distortions, and of the inherent difficulties involved with verbal thought, for it always implies a single-line delineation.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:26。)你即为这种“多次元的自己”，你拥有这些人生，你创造并演出这些所谓的“宇宙激情剧”。只因你现在聚焦于这个特定的角色，就以为你的整个存在就是它。你为自己制定这些规则是有其原因的。意识是在一个变为的状态(a state of becoming)中，因此我所说的这个多次元的自身不是一个完整且已完成的心理结构。它也是在一个变为的状态中。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:26.) You are the multidimensional self who has these existences, who creates and takes part in these cosmic passion plays, so to speak. It is only because you focus in this particular role now that you identify your entire being with it. You have set these rules for yourself for a reason. And consciousness is in a state of becoming, and so this multidimensional self of which I speak is not a psychological structure completed and done with. It is also in a state of becoming.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">它正在学习实现的艺术(art of actualization)。在它里面有无量的创造泉源、无限的发展潜能，但它还没学到加以实现的方法，必须在自身内找到方法，把在它里面那些数不清的创造带入存在。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It is learning the art of actualization. It has within it infinite sources of creativity, unlimited possibilities of development. But it has yet to learn the means of actualization, and must find within itself ways to bring into existence those untold creations that are within it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:32。)因此它创造在其中运作的种种不同情况，并给自己设下挑战，有些挑战在你们来说必然会遭失败，至少在一开始是如此，因为它首先必须创造那些会带来新创造的情境。而所有这些，它都是怀着伟大的自发性与无限喜悦来做的。(停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:32.) Therefore it creates varieties of conditions in which to operate, and sets itself challenges, some doomed to failure in your terms, at least initially, because it must first create the conditions which will bring new creations about. And all of this is done with great spontaneity and unbounded joy. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此你创造出来的环境远比你知道的要多。每个扮演自己角色的演员，集中焦点于戏里，都有一个内在的指导原则。因此，他不是被弃置于一个自己所创造却遗忘了的戏里，透过我所谓的内在感官，他能得到知识与资料。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You therefore create far more environments than you realize. Now, each actor, going about the role, focused within the play, has an inner guide line. He is not left, therefore, abandoned within a play that he has forgotten in his own creation. He has knowledge and information that comes to him through what I call the inner senses.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:39分。停顿很久。)因此，除了被给予那些严格局限于这出戏范围内的资料之外，他还有其他的资料来源。每个演员直觉地知道此点，而且在戏本身之中，已设有某些片段，已留有余地以便每个演员能休息而消除疲劳。在这种时候，他的内在感官告知他自己其他的角色，而他领悟到他是远超过任一出戏剧中出现的自己。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:39. Long pause.) He has other sources of information, therefore, than those strictly given within the confines of the production. Each actor knows this instinctively, and there are periods set and allowed for within the play itself in which each actor retires in order to refresh himself. In these he is informed through the inner senses of his other roles, and he realizes that he is far more than the self appearing in any given play.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在这些时候，他了解到在剧本的编写上他也有份，而他并不受当他积极介入剧中活动时假设扮演的角色限制。当然，这些时期与你的睡眠状况和作梦情形相吻合；但也有其他的时间，那时每个演员相当清楚地看到，他是被道具所包围的，那时他的洞察力突然刺穿了戏剧制作仿佛的真实。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In these periods he understands that he had his hand in the writing of the play, and he is freed from those assumptions that bind him while he is actively concerned with the drama’s activities. These periods, of course, coincide with your sleep states and dreaming conditions; but there are also other times when each actor sees quite clearly that he is surrounded by props, and when his vision suddenly pierces the seeming reality of the production.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:44。)这并不表示戏不是真的，或不应拿它当真。但它的确表示你是在扮演一个角色——一个重要的角色。不过，每个演员自己必须领悟此剧的本质与他在其中的角色。他必须在戏的三次元背景的限制中实现自己。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:44.) This does not mean that the play is not real, or that it should not be taken seriously. It does mean playing a role ---- an important one. Each actor must of himself realize, however, the nature of the production and his part in it. He must actualize himself out of the three-dimensional confines of the play’s setting.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在如此重要的制作背后，有伟大的合作，而在演他的角色时，每个演员首先得在三次元的实相中将自己确实化。除非多次元的自己将其一部分在三次元的实相中具体化，否则它无法在其中演出，你懂吗？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There is great cooperation behind such momentous productions, and in playing his role, each actor first actualizes himself within three-dimensional reality. The multidimensional self cannot act within three-dimensional reality until it materializes a portion of itself within it. Do you follow me?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“我懂。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Yes.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">然后，在这实相之内，它才能促成否则无法出现的各种创造与发展，可是，它接着必须经由自己三次元部分的另一次表演、另一次实现，而把自己推离这个系统。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Within this reality, it then brings about all kinds of creativity and development that could not appear otherwise. It must then propel itself from this system however, through another act, another actualization on the part of itself that is three-dimensional.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在它三次元的存在中，它以某种方式帮助了别人，那是只能在这情况下做到的，而它自己也受益不浅，得到了否则无法得到的发展。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>During its three-dimensional existence it has helped others in ways that they could not otherwise be helped, and it has been itself benefited and developed in ways that would be impossible otherwise.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我建议你休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I suggest your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:55。珍的出神状态很深。在11:02恢复。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:55. Jane’s trance had been deep. Resume at 11:02.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此，戏的意义你内心是知道的。演得这么好的只是你有意识的部分，而且它是如此稳固地聚焦于戏的背景范围之内。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: The meaning of the play is within you, therefore. It is only the conscious portion of you that acts so well, and that is focused so securely within the props of the production.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你能够得知任一生的目的，它就在你所知的有意识自己的表层下。还有各种的暗示与线索。你唾手可得你全部的多次元人格的知识。当你领悟到此，这知识让你能更快的解决问题或接受你所设的挑战；同时也打开了更广大的创造区域，使得这整出戏或演出更形丰富。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The purpose of any given life is available to you, the knowledge beneath the surface of the conscious self you know. All kinds of hints and clues are also available. You have the knowledge of your entire multidimensional personality at your fingertips. When you realize that you do, this knowledge allows you to solve the problems or meet the challenges you have set, quicker, in your terms; and also opens further areas of creativity by which the entire play or production can be enriched.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(11:08。)因此，按照你允许“多次元自己”的直觉与知识流过“有意识自己”的程度，你不但将你戏中的角色演得更称职，并且对整个世界加进了新的精力、洞见与创造性。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(11:08.) To the extent, therefore, that you allow the intuitions and knowledge of the multidimensional self to flow through the conscious self, to that extent not only do you perform your role in the play more effectively, but also you add new energy, insights, and creativity to the entire dimension.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">当然，在你看来似乎你是自己唯一有意识的部分，因为你只认同在此特定演出中的你。可是，你的多次元人格的其他部分，在这些其他的转世剧中，也是有意识的。因为你是一个多次元的意识，“你”在这些实相之外的其他实相里也是有意识的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now it seems to you, of course, that you are the only conscious part of yourself, for you are identifying with the actor in this particular production. The other portions of your multidimensional personality, in these other reincarnational plays, are also conscious, however. And because you are a multidimensional consciousness, “you” are also conscious in other realities beside these.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你的多次元人格，你的真正的本体，真正的你，在任何这些角色中，都意识到它自己的本来面目。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your multidimensional personality, your true identity, the real you, is conscious of itself, as itself, in any of these roles.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">口述完毕。现在给我们一点时间。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>End of dictation. Now give us a moment.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(停了一会儿之后，赛斯接下去回答了一些我们个人的问题。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(After a pause Seth went on to give us both some answers to personal questions.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们还有问题吗？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Do you have further questions?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“我想没有了，时间不早了。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“No, I guess not. It’s getting late.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那么我就真的要结束此节了，给你俩我最衷心的祝福。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Then I will indeed bring our session to a close, with my heartiest regards to you both.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安，谢谢你。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good night, Seth, and thank you.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(11:24。到现在赛斯的写书已成为课的架构之一个自然部分。同时他也开始有些逸出了在1970年1月10日的第510节中所给的大纲。但我们已意料到此。珍说赛斯是自己作主的。到现在已有许多人知道他的书了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(11:24 P.M. Seth’s production of his book had come to be a natural part of the framework by now. He was also beginning to deviate somewhat from the outline he’d given in the 510th session on January 10, 1970, but we had expected this. Seth was on his own, Jane said. Many people knew about his book by now.</details><br>
