(通常这节该在昨天举行，但珍为了想变化一下，试试星期四，在课前她说：“当我想到赛斯自己在写这本书时，我仍然感到怯场。”当课开始时，赛斯真的立即继续着“他的”书。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Ordinarily this session would have been held yesterday, but Jane wanted to try it on a Thursday for variety. Before the session she said, “I still get stage fright when I think of Seth doing this book on his own.” And when the session began, Seth did at once resume work on “his” book.)</details>
晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Good evening.</details>

现在，我们继续。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: We will continue.</details>
这本书本身就可以证实“自我”并没有全盘的占有“人格”，因为无疑的它确是由另一个“人格”制作，而非那名为珍·罗伯兹的作家的人格。既然珍·罗伯兹所拥有的能力人人俱有，那么我们至少得承认，人类拥有的属性比平时我们归之于它的要多得多，我希望来解释这些能力是什么，并且指出每一个人都能用来释放出这些潜能的一些方法。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The fact of this book is proof that the ego does not have the whole kettle of personality to itself, for there is no doubt that it is being produced by some other personality than that of the writer known as Jane Roberts.. Since that Jane Roberts has no abilities that are not inherent in the species as a whole, then at the very least it must be admitted that human personality has many more attributes than those usually ascribed to it. I hope to explain what these abilities are, and point out the ways that each individual can use to release these potentials.</details>
“人格”是不断改变知觉的一个完形。它就是本体中能感知的那个部分。我不把我的感知勉强加诸我借之讲话的这位女士身上，她的意识在我们的通讯中也没被抹掉。她的意识反倒有所扩展，并且她把能量投射向三度空间之外。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Personality is a gestalt of ever-changing perception. It is the part of the identity which perceives. I do not force my perceptions upon the woman through whom I speak, nor is her consciousness blotted out during our communications. Instead there is an expansion of her consciousness and a projection of energy that is directed away from three-dimensional reality.</details>
这种将注意力自物质系统抽离，可能使她的意识看起来像是被消灭了，其实，它反而更增强了。现在我从自己的世界对这位女士集中注意力，但她说的字句——这些在书页上的字句——原本并非语言性的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This concentration away from the physical system may make it appear as if her consciousness is blotted out. Instead, more is added to it. Now from my own field of reality I focus my attention toward the woman, but the words that she speaks ---- these words upon the pages ---- are not initially verbal at all.</details>
首先，你们所知的语言是一种缓慢的玩意儿：一个个字母串成一个字，一个个字再造成一句，这是线型思想模式的结果。如你们所知的语言，部分而言，并且就文法而言，是你们物质世界时间顺序的最终产品。你们在同一时间只能集中注意力于这么多的事情，而你们的语言结构不足以表达错综复杂的、同时发生的经验。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In the first place, language as you know it is a slow affair: letter by letter strung out to make a word, and words to make a sentence, the result of a linear thought pattern. Language, as you know it, is partially and grammatically the end product of your physical time sequences. You can only focus upon so many things at one time, and your language structure is not given to the communication of intricate, simultaneous experience.</details>
我知道一种不同的经验，非线型的、能够对无限的同时性事件聚焦并且反应。鲁柏无法表达它们，因此如果想要说出来的话，它们必须平摊成线型的表达方式。这感知无限的同时性事件，并对之反应的能力，是每个“全我”或“存有”(entity)的基本特征。因此之故，我不号称它是我的独门技艺。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am aware of a different kind of experience, not linear, and can focus upon and react to an infinite variety of simultaneous events. Ruburt could not express them, and so they must be leveled out into linear expression if they are to be communicated. This ability to perceive and react to unlimited simultaneous events is a basic characteristic of each whole self or entity. Therefore, I do not claim it as some feat that is exclusively my own.</details>
每个读者目前既然藏匿于肉体形式之内，因此，我假定(幽默地)，他就只知道自己的一小部分而已——如我先前提到的。存有就是整个的本体(identity)，而每个“人”只是这本体的一个显示——一个独立并永远确实的部分。因此，在这些通讯里，鲁柏的意识扩展了，却聚焦于一个不同的次元，一个介于他和我的实相之间的空间，一个相当不受干扰的场地。此地在他的允许与同意下，我将某些观念灌输给他。那些观念并非中立的，因为所有的知识或资料都带着拥有者或传递者的个人色彩。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Each reader, being presently ensconced within a physical form, I presume (humorously), knows only a small portion of himself ---- as I mentioned earlier. The entity is the overall identity of which his personality is one manifestation ---- an independent and eternally valid portion. In these communications, therefore, Ruburt’s consciousness expands, and yet focuses in a different dimension, a dimension between his reality and mine, a field relatively free of distr action. Here I impress certain concepts upon him, with his permission and assent. They are not neutral, in that all knowledge or information bears the stamp of the personality who holds it or passes it on.</details>
鲁柏把他的语言知识供我们利用，而我俩一起相当自动地带出了我将要讲的各种字句。分神是可能发生的，就如任何资料都可能被曲解。不过，现在我们已习惯一同工作，扭曲已很少了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Ruburt makes his verbal knowledge available for our use, and quite automatically the two of us together cause the various words that will be spoken. Distr actions can occur, as any information can be distorted. We are used to working together now, however, and the distortions are very few.</details>
我的一些能量也投射给了鲁柏，控制他的肉体，他和我的能量一起在课中，现在就当我说这些句子时也一样。以后我还会讨论许多其他的枝节。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Some of my energy is also projected through Ruburt, and his energy and mine both activate his physical form during our sessions, and now as I speak these sentences. There are many other ramifications that I will discuss later.</details>
你们可以休息。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break.</details>
(9:46—9:55。)因此，我并非鲁柏潜意识的产物，正如他也非我的潜意识的产物。我也不是一个第二人格(secondary personality)，伶俐地试图颠覆一个不安定的自我。事实上我特别留意使鲁柏人格的所有部分都受益，并使它们的完整性得以维持并受到尊崇。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:46 to 9:55.) I am not, therefore, a product of Ruburt’s subconscious, any more than he is a product of my subconscious mind. Nor am I a secondary personality, cleverly trying to undermine a precarious ego. I have seen to it in fact that all portions of Ruburt’s personality are benefited, and their integrity maintained and honored.</details>
在他的人格内有一颇为独特的设备，才使得我们有通讯的可能。我将尽可能以最简单的方式予以说明：在他心灵内有一个相当于“透明的次元曲速面”(transparent dimensional warp)的东西，它几乎可被当作一扇打开的窗子，经由它能感知到其他的实相；那是一个多次元的开口，到某个程度它不被实质焦点的阴影所遮蔽。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There is within his personality a rather unique facility that makes our communications possible. I will try to put this as simply as possible: There is within his psyche what amounts to a transparent dimensional warp that serves almost like an open window through which other realities can be perceived, a multidimensional opening that has to some extent escaped being clouded over by the shade of physical focus.</details>
肉体感官常使你看不见这些开放的通道，因为五官只按照其自己的形象来感知实相。那么，到某个程度，我透过你们时空里的一个心理的曲速面进入你们的实相。以某种方式说，这样的一个开放的通道几乎像是鲁柏与我的人格之间的一个通路，因此两者之间能有沟通。这种在存在的不同次元之间的“心理的与心灵的曲速面”并非不寻常。只是它们不常被认出来，更不常被利用。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The physical senses usually blind you to these open channels, for they perceive reality only in their own image. To some extent, then, I enter your reality through a psychological warp in your space and time. In a manner of speaking, such an open channel serves much as a pathway between Ruburt’s personality and my own, so that communication is possible between. Such psychological and psychic warps between dimensions of existence are not infrequent. They are merely recognized as such infrequently and utilized even less so.</details>
(长长的停顿，很多次之一。但整体说来，珍的速度要比与赛斯书有关的头两节快得多，而且更有信心。同时她也喜欢赛斯到现在为止所写的东西。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Long pause, one of many. But overall Jane’s pace was faster and more confident than in the first two sessions dealing with Seth’s book. She also liked what Seth had done on his book so far.)</details>
我将试着给你对我自己没有形体的存在一些概念，让它来提醒你，你自己基本的本体与身份与我自己的一样也是没有形体的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I will try to give you some idea of my own nonphysical existence. Let it serve to remind you that your own basic identity is as nonphysical as my own.</details>
那即为第一章的结束。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>That is the end of Chapter One.</details>
(“好的。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Okay.”)</details>
第二章 我现在的环境、工作与活动<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>CHAPTER 2 MY PRESENT ENVIRONMENT, WORK, AND ACTIVITIES</details>
(现在是10:16。珍停下来，揉揉她闭着的眼睛。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(It was 10:16. Jane paused, rubbing her closed eyes.)</details>
我们开始第二章。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We will begin Chapter Two.</details>
虽然我的环境在相当重要的方面与我读者的环境不同(幽默地)，我可以以轻描淡写的讽刺向你们保证，它是与有形世界同样的生动、多变并且充满活力的。它更有乐趣——虽然自从我不再具有身体以后我对享乐的概念已略为改变——因为它更有回报，而且给创造性的成就提供了多得多的机会。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>While my environment differs in rather important respects (humorously) from that of my readers, I can assure you, with ironic understatement, that it is as vivid, varied, and vital as physical existence. It is more pleasurable ---- though my ideas of pleasure have changed some since I was a physical being ---- being more rewarding and offering far greater opportunities for creative achievement.</details>
我现在的存在是所有我经历过那许多有形或无形的存在中，最具挑战性的一个。无形的意识并非只住在一种次元中，就好比在你们的星球上，不止有一个国家，在你们的太阳系里也不止有一个星球。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My present existence is the most challenging one that I have known, and I have known many, both physical and nonphysical. There is not just one dimension in which nonphysical consciousness resides, any more than there is only one country on your planet or planet within your solar system.</details>
那么，我的环境并非你们在死后立即会到的地方。我不得不幽默地说，在你进入这一个存在层面(plane)之前，你还得死好多次呢！<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My environment, now, is not the one in which you will find yourself immediately after death. I cannot help speaking humorously, but you must die many times before you enter this particular plane of existence.</details>
出生时你所受的惊吓，比死亡要大得多。有时候你死了自己还不知道，但出生几乎总是意味着一个尖锐而突然的体认。所以不需要怕死，而已死过太多次懒都懒得计算了的我，写这本书就是要告诉你此事。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Birth is much more of a shock than death. Sometimes when you die you do not realize it, but birth almost always implies a sharp and sudden recognition. So there is no need to fear death. And I, who have died more times than I care to tell, write this book to tell you so.)</details>
我在这个环境中的工作比你们任何人所知的都更具挑战性，并且还必须操纵你们现在几乎无从理解的创作材料，不久我还会再谈这点。首先，你必须了解，除了被意识所创造的实相之外，没有客观实相存在。永远是意识创造形式(form)，而非其反面。因此我的环境是由我自己和其他像我一样的“人”所创造的一个存在的地方，它代表了我们内心发展的外在显现。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My work in this environment provides far more challenge than any of you know, and it also necessitates the manipulation of creative materials that are nearly beyond your present comprehension. I will say more of this shortly. First of all, you must understand that no exists but that which is created by consciousness. Consciousness always creates form, and not the other way around. So my environment is a reality of existence created by myself and others like me, and it represents the manifestation of our development.</details>
我们不用永久性的结构。好比说，我不住在一个城或镇里，但我并没暗示我们浮在虚空之中。我们对空间的想法与你们不一样，此其一，而且我们想要四周有什么样的形象就造出它来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We do not use permanent structures. There is not a city or a town, for example, in which I dwell. I do not mean to imply that we are off in empty space. For one thing we do not think of space as you do, and we form whatever particular images we want to surround us.</details>
它们是由我们的精神状态创造出来的。(就)如你们自己的物质实相是你们内在欲望和思想分毫不差的复制品一样。你们以为实物不依赖你们而独立存在，却没体认到它们其实是你们自己“心理与心灵的自身”之外在显现。我们了悟是我们造成了自己的实相，因此我们怀着很大的喜悦去尽情挥洒。在我的环境中你们会非常的迷惑，因为对你们来说它似乎缺乏一致性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They are created by ourmental patterns, [just] as your own physical reality is created in perfect replica of your inner desires and thoughts. You think that objects exist independently of you, not realizing that they are instead the manifestations of your own psychological and psychic selves. We realize that we form our own reality, and therefore we do so with considerable joy and creative abandon. In my environment you would be highly disoriented, for it would seem to you as if it lacked coherency.</details>
但是，我们知道支配所有“具体化”的内在法则。我能展现出你所谓的历史的任一段时间，或昼或夜。这些变化的情形不会给我的同伴任何困扰，因为他们将之视为了解我的心境、情绪与概念的一个直接线索。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We are aware of the inner laws that govern all “materializations,” however. I can have it night or day, in your terms, as I prefer ---- or any period, say, of your history. These changing forms would in no way bother my associates, for they would take them as immediate clues as to my mood, feelings, and ideas.</details>
(在讲这一段话时，珍走进厨房——仍在出神状态中——翻来翻去找火柴：她想点支烟。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(While delivering this paragraph Jane walked into the kitchen, still in trance, to rummage for a book of matches; she wanted to light a cigarette.)</details>
永恒性与稳定性基本上与形相无关，而与快乐、目的、成就与身份的整合(integration)有关。我“旅行”到很多其他的存在层面去，以完成我的责任。我的责任主要是个老师与教育者，而在那些系统里，我利用对我最有用的任何教具与技术。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Permanency and stability basically have nothing to do with form, but with the integration of pleasure, purpose, accomplishment, and identity. I “travel” to many other levels of existence in order to fulfill my duties, which are primarily those of a teacher and educator, and I use whatever aids and techniques serve me best within those systems.</details>
换言之，我可以用许多不同的方法来教同样的道理，而我选用的方法是按照我必须在其中运作的那个系统内天生具有的能力与假设。在这些通讯中，以及在这本书中，我用到我本体中可用的许多个人格中的一个部分。在其他的实相系统里，他们不会了解我——较大的赛斯本体——在这儿所采用的这个特殊的赛斯人格。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In other words, I may teach the same lesson in many different ways, according to the abilities and assumptions that are inherent in any given system in which I must operate. I use one portion of myself from many personalities that are available to my identity in these communications, and in this book. In other systems of reality, this particular Seth personality that I, the larger Seth identity adopt here, would not be understood.</details>
并非所有的实相系统都是有形的，你可要明白，有一些对实质形相完全不知。如你们所了解的性别对他们也非自然的。因此我不会以一个曾经有过许多“人身”的男性人格来与他们沟通，虽然那是我的本体合理而确实的一部分。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>All systems of reality are not physically oriented, you see, and some are entirely unacquainted with physical form. Nor is sex, as you understand it, natural to them. Therefore I would not communicate as a male personality who has lived many physical existences, though this is a legitimate and valid portion of my identity.</details>
你的手写累了吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Are your fingers tired?</details>
(“不累，我很好。”10:54。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“No, I’m okay.” 10:54.)</details>
在我自家的环境里，我可以呈现任何我喜欢的扮相，它可以并且的确会随我思想的性质而变。然而，你多少也以相同的方式，在一个无意识层面形成你自己的肉体形象，但其中有些重要的相异点。通常你没了解到，在每一刻你创造了你的肉体，而它是你对“你是什么”的内在概念的直接结果，而且它随着你自己思想不断变动的步调而有重要的化学与电磁方面的改变。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: In my home environment I assume whatever shape I please, and it may vary, and does, with the nature of my thoughts. You, however, form your own physical image at an unconscious level in more or less the same manner, but with some important differences. You usually do not realize that your physical body is created by you at each moment as a direct result of your inner conception of what you are, or that it changes in important chemical and electromagnetic ways with the ever-moving pace of your own thought.</details>
由于我们早就认清形相依赖着意识，我们仅只是能够全盘改变我们的形相，使它们更忠实地追随着我们内在经验的每一个极精微的变化而已。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Having long ago recognized the dependence of form upon consciousness, we have simply been able to change our forms entirely so that they more faithfully follow each nuance of our inner experience.</details>
你可以休息或结束此节，随你的意。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take a break or end the session as you prefer.</details>
(“我们休息一下。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“We’ll take the break.”</details>
(11:00。珍的出神状态很深，虽然她好像很快便回过神。她说当她在课中，她知道自己讲的每个字，却几乎立刻就忘了。但是，到了11:05，她才知道原来在休息时她并未“完全回神”。在11:07继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(11:00. Jane’s trance had been good, although she appeared to come out of it quickly enough. She said she knew each word as she delivered it during the session, but forgot it almost at once. By 11:05, though, she realized she hadn’t really “completely come out of it” at break after all. Resume at 11:07.)</details>
任一意识都与生具有改变形相的能力，只是熟练度与实现的程度有所不同。在你自己的系统内，当你观察生物在它的“演化”史中所经过的形相改变，你就可以看到这种改变以一种“慢动作影片”的方式呈现出来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: This ability to change form is an inherent characteristic of any consciousness. Only the degree of proficiency and actualization varies. You can see this in your own system, in a slowed-down version, when you observe the changing forms taken by living matter through its “evolutionary” history.</details>
可以说，我们也能同时兼具好几个形相，你们也能这样做，虽然通常你们并不知道。你的肉体形相能躺在床上睡着不动，同时你的意识却以梦中形相神游到相当遥远的地方。同时你可以创造与你自己一模一样的“思想形相”(thought-form),出现在一个朋友的屋中，而意识上你却完全不知不觉。因此关于意识在任何时候能创造什么形相，根本是没有限制的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now, we can also take several forms at one time, so to speak, but you can also do this although you do not generally realize it. Your physical form can lie sleeping and inert upon the bed while your consciousness travels in a dream form to places quite distant. Simultaneously you may create a “thought form” of yourself, identical in every respect, and this may appear in the room of a friend quite without your conscious awareness. So consciousness is not limited as to the forms it can create at any given time.</details>
实际来说，我们在这些方面比你们进步得多，而当我们创造这些形相时我们是完全知道的。我与其他多少面对同样挑战，并有同样整体发展模式的“人”共享我的存在领域。这些“人”中，有些我认识，有些则否。我们以心电感应沟通，但心电感应也同样是你们语言的基础，没有心电感应的话，语言的象征性便将毫无意义了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Practically speaking, we are rather more advanced along these lines than you, and when we create such forms we do so with complete awareness. I share my field of existence with others who have more or less the same challenges to meet, the same overall pattern of development. Some I have known and others I have not. We communicate telepathically, but then again, telepathy is the basis for your languages, without which their symbolism would be meaningless.</details>
只因我们的确以这种方式沟通，并不必然表示我们使用脑子里的字句(mental words)，因为我们并不。反倒是，我们以我只可称之为“热与电磁的影像”来沟通，那些影像在一个“段落”中能够拥有多得多的意义。沟通的强度依赖在其后的情感强度，虽然“情感的强度”这说法可能引起误解。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Because we do communicate in this manner, this does not necessarily mean that we usemental words, for we do not. We communicate instead through what I can only call thermal and electromagnetic images that are capable of supporting much more meaning in one “sequence.” The intensity of the communication is dependent upon the emotional intensity behind it, although the phrase “emotional intensity” may be misleading.</details>
我们的确有与你们所谓的情感相等的东西，虽然这些不是你们所知的爱、恨或愤怒。对你们的“情感”最恰当的描述是，那是与“内在感官”(inner senses)有关的远较伟大的心理事件与经验，在三度空间里的实质化。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We do feel an equivalent of what you call emotions, though these are not the love or Hate or anger that you know. Your feelings can best be described as the three-dimensional materializations of far greater psychological events and experiences that are related to the “inner senses.”</details>
在本章的结尾我会解释内在感官。此地只说我们有强烈的情感经验就够了，虽然它与你们的经验大异其趣。它的限制要少得多，并且远较开阔，因为我们也知觉整个情感的“气候”，并对之起反应。我们有更多的自由去感觉与经验，因为我们不那么怕被情感席卷。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I will explain these inner senses to you later, at the end of this chapter. Suffice it here to say that we have strong emotional experience, although it differs in a large measure from your own. It is far less limited and far more expansive in that we are also aware and responsive to the emotional “ climate” as a whole. We are much freer to feel and experience, because we are not so afraid of being swept away by feeling.</details>
举例来说，我们的本体不会被别人的强烈情绪威胁。我们能以一种现在对你们还非自然的方式“出入”情感，并将它们转译为其他你们不熟悉的创造面。我们不觉得有隐藏情感的必要，因为我们知道基本上那是不可能也不好的。在你们的系统内情感可能显得令人苦恼，因为你们还没学会怎么用它们。我们现在才在学习情感的全部潜能，以及与它们相连的创造力之威力。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Our identities do not feel threatened, for example, by the strong emotions of another. We are able to travel through emotions in a way that is not now natural to you, and to translate them into other facets of creativity than those with which you are familiar. We do not feel the need to conceal emotions, for we know it is basically impossible and undesirable. Within your system they can appear troublesome because you have not yet learned how to use them. We are only now learning their full potential, and the powers of creativity with which they are connected.</details>
我们结束这一节吧。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We will end our session.</details>
