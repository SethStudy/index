<div style="display:inline">1971年8月4日 星期三 晚上9：04</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>AUGUST 4, 1971, 9:04 P.M. WEDNESDAY</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(今晚一反常例，我们早就准备好上课了。我告诉珍我希望赛斯会讨论她昨晚的一个梦。它涉及我俩而且是非常乐观的；我确信它是以象征性的手法来谈我们的工作。赛斯的确在此节结尾分析了这个梦，因此我把那资料由他写书的口述中删除了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(We were ready for the session early this evening, for a change. I told Jane I hoped Seth would discuss a dream she’d had last night. It involved the two of us and was very optimistic; I was sure that in symbolic terms it dealt with our work. Seth did analyze the dream at the end of the session, so that material is deleted from the dictation on his book.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在将近9:00时，珍开始显出一种典型的样子，在坐着等时她变得安静多了，开始由低垂的眼睛向两旁侧视；她似乎警觉地等着某个心里的信号。然后她告诉我赛斯“就在旁边”，马上就要开课了。当她把眼镜拿开，把它放在前面的咖啡桌上时，她就在出神状态了。她的步调在开始时相当的慢。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(With the approach of 9:00 Jane began to acquire a typical bearing. She became quiet as she sat waiting, and started glancing sideways from lowered eyes; she seemed to be alert for a certain subjective signal. Then she told me Seth was “around” and that the session would begin in a moment. When she took her glasses off and placed them upon the coffee table before her, she was in trance. Her pace was quite slow at the beginning.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们继续。有些种类的意识无法以具体的用语释明。那创始了你们刚才读到的那一段话的“人物”就是这样的一位。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: We will continue. There are kinds of consciousness that cannot be deciphered in physical terms. The “personality” who originated the paragraphs you have just read is such a one.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如我提到过的，在那人格与我之间和鲁柏与我之间存在着同类的联系。但以你们的话来说，“赛斯二”离我的实相远比我离鲁柏的实相要远。如果你喜欢，你可以把“赛斯二”想象为我的一个未来部分，但这里面所涉及的远比这要多。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>As mentioned, there is the same kind of connection between that personality and myself as the one that exists between Ruburt and myself. But in your terms, Seth Two is far further divorced from my reality than I am from Ruburt’s. You can imagine Seth Two as a future portion of me if you prefer, and yet far more is involved.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我自己在此用简单的说法，试着使这些概念清楚些。在出神状态里，鲁柏能与我接触。在一种某方面与出神状态类似的状态，我能接触“赛斯二”。我们的关系很难解释，在意识重重的网里我们联合在一起，那么，我的实相不只包括我所有转世的身份，还包括其它不一定与任何物质有关联的存在完形。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I am myself using simple terms here to try and make these ideas clearer. In a trance state, Ruburt can contact me. In a state in some ways similar to a trance, I can contact Seth Two. We are related in ways quite difficult to explain, united in webs of consciousness. My reality includes, then, not only reincarnational identities but also other gestalts of being that do not necessarily have any physical connections.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">对此书的每一位读者而言，也都一样。因此，灵魂是无止境的。它不是个闭锁的灵性或心灵系统。我一直想办法让你们明白灵魂不是个分离的、与你分开的东西。它从没与你分开过，就跟“神”——大写——从没与你分开过一样。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The same applies to each reader of this book. The soul is open-ended, therefore. It is not a closed spiritual or psychic system. I have tried to show you that the soul is not a separate, apart-from-you thing. It is no more divorced from you than ---- capital ---- God is.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">没有必要创造一个分离的神，存在于你们的宇宙之外，并与之分离，也没有任何必要把灵魂当成是个遥远的“存有”。“神”或“一切万有”，是你最亲密的一部分。“祂的”能量形成你的本体，而以同样的方式你的灵魂也就是你的一部分。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There is no need to create a separate god who exists outside of your universe and separate from it, nor is there any need to think of a soul as some distant entity. God, or All That Is, is intimately a part of you. “His” energy forms your identity, and your soul is a part of you in the same manner.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:18)我自己转世的人格、可能的自己、甚至“赛斯二”，现在都存在于我之内，而我存在于他们之内。以你们的话来说，“赛斯二”是更高深的，他也是更陌生的，他无法像我这样与你们人间生活扯上关系，因为我在人世有深厚的背景。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:18.) My own reincarnational personalities, probable selves, and even Seth Two exist within me now, as I exist within them. In your terms, Seth Two is more advanced. In your terms, he is more alien, since he cannot relate to your physical existence as well as I do because of my background in it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">但是，我的经验仍然丰富了“赛斯二”，而他的经验丰富了我到我能感知并转译它们为我自己所用的程度。以同样的方式，鲁柏的人格在与我的关系中得到了扩展，而我也由这经验获益，因为，就连最好的老师也透过每一种活动次元中学习。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Still, my experience enriches Seth Two, and his experiences enrich me to the extent that I am able to perceive and translate them for my own use. In the same way, Ruburt’s personality is expanded through relationship with me, and I also gain through the experience, as even the best of teachers learns from each dimension of activity.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">广义地说，我的灵魂包括我的转世人格、“赛斯二”及可能的自己。附带地说，我对我可能的自己与对我转世的人生都一样有知觉。你们对灵魂的观念根本就太过狭隘。我并不是真的在谈群体灵魂(group souls)的观点，虽然也可以这样诠释。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In larger terms, my soul includes my reincarnational personalities, Seth Two, and probable selves. I am as aware of my probable selves, incidentally, as I am of my reincarnational existences. Your concept of the soul is simply so limited. I am not really speaking in terms of group souls, though this interpretation can also be made.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">灵魂的每一“部分”包括了全部——一个我确知会令你们吃惊的观念。当你变得对你自己的主观实相更有知觉时，你就会因而变得与你自己灵魂的更多部分熟悉。当你把灵魂想作是一个封闭的系统，你也就会那样感知它，而你就再也不会认识它更大的创造性与特性了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Each “part” of the soul contains the whole ---- a concept I am sure will startle you. As you become more aware of your own subjective reality you will therefore, become familiar with greater portions of your own soul. When you think of the soul as a closed system you perceive it as such, and close off from yourself the knowledge of its greater creativity and characteristics.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:27)“赛斯二”在你们来说，的确某个程度代表了我将要变成的样子，但是当我变成他现在的样子时，他又将是某种不同的东西。现在只有在相同的说法之下，鲁柏可能变成我现在的样子，但那时我将是很不同的另外什么了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:27.) Seth Two does represent what I will become, to some extent, and in your terms, yet when I become what he is he will be something different. In the same terms now, only, Ruburt may become what I am, but then I will be something far different.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不论你们自己知不知道，你们每个人也都涉足在这同类的关系里。虽然对你们来说，转世的人生仿佛牵涉了过去与未来的事件，它们却是与你们自己目前的生活和意识平行或相邻的。相对来说，你们更大本体的其他面也都存在于这些附近或四周。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Each of you are involved in the same kind of relationships, whether or not you are aware of them. Though it seems to you that reincarnational existences involve past and future events, they are existences parallel or adjacent to your own present life and consciousness. Other aspects of your greater identity exist, relatively speaking, about or around these.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(珍做为赛斯很专注地说着，她的眼睛大睁而颜色很深。她在空中画了一连串大圆圈。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane was speaking intently as Seth, her eyes wide and very dark. She made a series of large circular motions in the air.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">对实相本质的答案，你们所寻求的对“一切万有”的亲密知识，就在你们目前的经验之内，不假外求。要找到答案，必须透过一个进入你们自己内心的旅行，透过你们自己以及透过你们所知的世界。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The answers to the nature of reality, the intimate knowledge of All That Is that you all seek, is within your present experience. It will not be found outside of yourselves, but through an inner journey into yourself, through yourself and through the world that you know.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">请等我们片刻。(在9:32停了一分钟，眼睛闭着。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Give us a moment. (A one-minute pause, eyes closed, at 9:32.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我一度曾是十二个孩子的母亲。就教育而言，我是无知的，我一点也不美，尤其是在晚年，脾气狂暴，嗓音粗哑。这是在第六世纪的耶路撒冷一带。孩子们有许多个父亲。我尽可能地养活他们。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I was once a mother with twelve children. Ignorant in terms of education, far from beautiful, particularly in later years, with a wild temper and raucous voice. This was around Jerusalem in the sixth century. The children had many fathers. I did my best to provide for them.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我的名字是玛莎芭。我们随处棲身，寄人篱下，最后全去乞食。但在那个存在里，肉体生活有比我所有前生所知更大的一种对比、一种敏锐性。一些面包皮对我比任何我前生尝过的蛋糕还好吃得多，尽管那些蛋糕上覆有多好的糖饰。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>My name was Marshaba. We lived wherever we could, squatting in doorways and, finally, all begging. Yet in that existence, physical life had a contrast, a sharpness greater than any I had known. A crust of bread was far more delicious to me than any piece of cake, however well-frosted, had ever been in lives before.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">当我的孩子们嘻笑时，我开心极了，而不管我们多贫困，每个早晨都是个胜利的惊喜，因为我们没就此长眠，没给饿死。我故意选择了那一生，正如你们每个人也选择了你们自己的，而我如此做是因为我前面的几世享乐太多而令我太厌腻了。我太被保护了，使我再也不能清晰地把注意力集中在俗世能提供的真正了不得的肉体乐趣与经验上。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>When my children laughed I was overwhelmed with delight, and despite our privations, each morning was a triumphant surprise that we had not died in our sleep, that we had not succumbed to starvation. I chose that life deliberately, as each of you choose each of yours, and I did so because my previous lives had left me too blasé. I was too cushioned. I no longer focused with clarity upon the truly spectacular physical delights and experiences that earth can provide.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">虽然我对我的孩子们叫骂，有时也怒骂大自然的力量。我却彻头彻尾被存在的高贵庄严所震慑，而且对真正的灵性比我当僧侣时学到的还更多。这并不表示贫困会导向真理，或受苦有益于灵魂。许多与我共享那些情况的人并没学到什么。它的确是指你们在事前就知你的弱点与力量在哪里，而每个人为了你们自己的目的，选择了你们那一生的那种生活情况。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Though I yelled at my children and screamed sometimes in rage against the elements, I was struck through with the magnificence of existence, and learned more about true spirituality than I ever did as a monk. This does not mean that poverty leads to truth, or that suffering is good for the soul. Many who shared those conditions with me learned little. It does mean that each of you choose those life conditions that you have for your own purpose, knowing ahead of time where your weaknesses and strengths lie. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">以你们的话来说，我后来活过较富有的生活，而在我人格的完形里，那妇人仍活在我内在——举例来说，孩子活在大人的内在——她把后来的境遇与先前的人生相比，而充满了感激。她促使我更善用我的优势。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In the gestalt of my personality, as in your terms I lived later richer lives, that woman was alive again in me ---- as, for example, the child is alive in the adult, and filled with gratitude comparing later circumstances to the earlier existences. She urged me to use my advantages better.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此在你之内，你的各个不同的转世人生就更大的方式来说是同时发生的。再用成年的比喻，就好像你内在的儿童是你自己记忆与经验的一部分，但在另一方面却已离开了你，从你这儿走开了，好像你只是那个儿童“变成”的一个成人。因此我曾经做过的那些人，已走了他们的阳关道，却仍是我的一部分，而我也是他们的一部分。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>So in you, your various reincarnational existences in a large manner co-occur. Using the analogy of adulthood again, it is as if the child within you is a part of your own memory and experience, and yet in another way has left you, gone apart from you as if you are only one adult that the child “turned into.” So the people that I have been have gone their own way, and yet are a part of me and I of them.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我仍活在“赛斯二”的记忆里，就像一个他由其中跳出的“自己”。然而我现在这个“自己”却非他从里面跳出去的那个“自己”。只因你们对时间与意识的僵化概念，使得这些声明对你们而言似乎很奇怪；我再说一次：在一个较大的范围里，我能记得“赛斯二”。因此，所有这些联系都是开放的。所有的心理事件也全都彼此影响。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I am alive in Seth Two’s memory, as a self from which he sprang. Yet the self I am now is not the self from which he sprang. Only your rigid ideas of time and consciousness make these statements seem strange to you; for in a larger context, again, I can remember Seth Two. All of these connections therefore are open. All psychological events affect all others.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可以休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(对我，较大声地：)如果你对某事没能清楚了解，就请提出来——因为如果你不了解，那么读者也不了解。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(To me, louder): If you do not understand something clearly, mention it ---- because if you do not, then the reader will not.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好的。”)(9:55。珍对赛斯曾讨论的那女人没看到什么影像。她记起在早期的课里，赛斯怎么样谈到大半数的存有至少有三次转世人生——以及当她后来开始了悟到赛斯已活过许多世后她如何地感到“骇异”。现在，她觉得同时的“转世”生活概念十分可以接受；这适合她情感上与理性上的脾性。当这些课开始时，珍特别被她所谓对转世的陈腔滥调所困扰，因为它们与善、恶、罚等概念混淆在一起。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Okay.” 9:55. Jane had no images of the woman Seth had been discussing. She remembered how, in early sessions, Seth had talked about a minimum of three reincarnational existences for most entities ---- and how “scandalized” she’d been later when she began to realize that Seth had lived many lives. Now, she finds that the idea of simultaneity of “reincarnational” lives is quite acceptable; this fits her emotional and intellectual temperament. When the sessions began, Jane was especially bothered by what she called the trite and popular ideas about reincarnation, mixed up as they were with ideas of good and evil, punishment, etc.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(现在她提到有一次赛斯在ESP班所讲的话，她说：“我全心同意赛斯的声明：转世是个迷思，就如它是个事实一样。”以下是在那1971年5月4日的课程里，赛斯讲的一部分：“因此你们对‘转世’以及对所涉及的‘时间’的了解，的确是个非常简化了的故事……转世就其本身而言，也是个寓言。好像对你们来说，你们很难了解你们活在许多实相里——以及许多世纪里——在同一个时间……”10:22以缓慢的步调继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“I go along wholeheartedly with Seth’s statement that reincarnation is as much a myth as a fact,” she said now, referring to an ESP class session. In that session, for May 4, 1971, Seth said in part: “So what you understand of reincarnation, and of the time terms involved, is a very simplified tale indeed…. Reincarnation, in its own way, is also a parable. It seems very difficult for you to understand that you live in many realities ---- and many centuries ---- at one time….” 10:22. Resume at a slow pace.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">所有的存在与意识全是相互交织的。只有当你把灵魂想作是某个不同的、分离的、因而是封闭的东西时，你才会想到一位分离的神——一个好像与创造分开的人格。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>All of existence and consciousness is interwoven. Only when you think of the soul as something different, separate, and therefore closed, are you led to consider a separate god ---- a personality that seems to be apart from creation.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">“一切万有”是创造的一部分，但比创造之为创造还要多。有种不可形容的“金字塔式的存在完形”(pyramid gestalts of being)，它们的知觉包括的知识与经验,在你们看来仿佛是很多其他实相。以你们所能了解的用语来解释，则是：它们的“现在”可能把你们星球的生与死包括在它们‘时间’的一刹那里。“赛斯二”的存在是在一个这种“意识银河”的外缘。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>All That Is is a part of creation, but more than what creation is. There are pyramid gestalts of being impossible to describe, whose awareness includes knowledge and experience of what would seem to be to you a vast number of other realities. In the terms of which I am speaking for your benefit, their present might, for example, include the life and death of your planet in a moment of their “time.” Seth Two’s existence is at the outside fringes of one such galaxy of consciousness.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在10:30停顿。)当“赛斯二”说话时，鲁柏最初会有以下的知觉：他的意识随着一个内在心灵的通道，一个变活了的漏斗而向上拉紧，直到它根本无法再前进时为止。那时，在他来说，仿佛他的意识经由一个无形的金字塔走出了他的身体，那金字塔的顶端是张开的，而且一直远伸到太空里去。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 10:30.) When Seth Two speaks, Ruburt initially is aware of the following: His consciousness strains upward, following an inner psychic pathway, an energized funnel, until quite simply it can go no further. It seems to him then that his consciousness goes out of his body through an invisible pyramid whose open top stretches far up into space.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这里他好像与一些不具人格的象征接触，它们的讯息可以说是自动转译成了文字。那一个点实际上代表次元里的一个“曲速面”，一个介于系统之间的地方，它与能量及心理实相的关系远比它与空间的关系更大，因为空间是没有意义的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Here he seems to make contact with impersonal symbols whose message is somehow automatically translated into words. That point actually represents a warp in dimensions, a place between systems that has far more to do with energy and Psychological reality than it has to do with space, for space is meaningless.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在这种时候，我几乎总在场当翻译。为了这种通讯，我对他们两个的实相都必须要有认识和理解。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I am almost always present as a translator at such times. My knowledge of both realities is necessary for the communication.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(停顿良久。)“赛斯二”所熟悉的是全然不同的一套象征及意义，因此，在这情形，要有两次转译——一次由我，一次由鲁柏。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Long pause.) Seth Two is familiar with an entirely different set of symbols and meanings, so that, in this case, two translations are being given ---- one by me and one by Ruburt.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们希望，某些不能用其他方式传递的观念，能以这方法来传递。这种样子的实相与经验的混合，这些由一系统传到另一系统的讯息，不断地以各种不同的方式产生，以种种不同的“扮相”在你们的世界里出现——像是许多种不同的“灵感”。换言之，有人在冥冥中帮助你们。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Hopefully, certain concepts will be delivered in this way that could not be delivered otherwise. These minglings of reality and experience, these messages from one system to another, occur in various ways continually, emerging in your world in one guise or another ---- as inspiration of many kinds. You are being helped, in other words.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，你们也在运用你们自己的能力，因为你们自己的个性大半决定了你们能接受多少帮助。当“赛斯二”说话时，鲁柏所明显感受到的象征很合用，但向外也就是向内，因此意识也在向内旅行，就如他以为是向外旅行的一样远。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You are also using your own abilities, however, for your own characteristics largely determine the amount of help you receive. The symbolism apparent to Ruburt when Seth Two speaks works well, but outward is also inward, and so consciousness travels as far inward as it seems to him to go outward.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这种接触与知识每个个人都可得。“一切万有”对它所有的部分说话，不是从外面用声音、小喇叭和号角，而是经由每个意识活生生的“灵魂质”来传递它的讯息。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Such contacts and knowledge are available to each individual. All That Is speaks to all of its parts, not with sounds, trumpets, and fanfare from without, but communicates its messages through the living soul-stuff of each consciousness.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在，如果你要我谈谈珍的梦，我建议我们结束今晚的课。你可以休息，或我就开始梦的诠释，随你喜欢。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: If you want something on the dream, I suggest we end dictation for this evening. You may take a break or I will begin the interpretation as you prefer.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:45：“你还是开始吧。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:45. “You might as well begin.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">请等我们稍久一点(停顿)。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Give us a good moment. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(赛斯于是对珍的梦传递了两页极佳的解释。这节在11:05结束。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Seth then delivered two excellent pages explaining Jane’s dream. The session ended at 11:05 P.M.)</details><br>
