<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">口述：一般说来(微笑)，以你们的话来说，一旦是“说法者”便永远是“说法者”。在某些生中，可能非常有力的用到这种能力，以致该人格的所有其他面都留在幕后隐而不显了。在另一些时候，这些才能可能很胆小地被用到。“说法者”都拥有格外活跃的感觉及念力的投射。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Dictation: Generally speaking (smile), once a Speaker always a Speaker, in your terms. In some incarnations, the abilities might be used so powerfully that all other aspects of the personality remained in the background. At other times the capacities might be timidly used. The Speakers possess an extraordinary vividness of feeling and thought projection.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他们能借由沟通给人更深的印象。他们能轻易地由内在实相转到外在实相。他们本能上就知道如何运用象征。在无意识的层面上他们极富创造性，不断在正常意识之下形成心灵的架构，以供他们自己与他人在梦中或出神状态中使用。他们常出现在他人的梦中，而帮助作梦者操纵内在实相。他们化身成作梦者可以与之发生关联的形象，可被用为桥梁的形象，然后用它作为门户，以助人进入与你们自己意识隔得更远的那种意识。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They can impress others with greater import through their communications. They can move from inner to outer reality with easy ability. They know instinctively how to use symbolism. They are highly creative on an unconscious level, constantly forming psychic frameworks beneath normal consciousness that can be used both by themselves and others in dream and trance states. They often appear to others in the dream condition, and they help dreamers in the manipulation of inner reality. They form images with which the dreamers can relate, images that can be used as bridges and then as gateways into kinds of consciousness more separated from your own.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:30)神明的象征意义，譬如说，在奥林匹斯山上的神明这个想法，在冥河(River Styx)上的渡头——那类现像是由“说法者”创始的。因此，宗教的象征和架构必须不只存在于物质世界，也还存在于无意识的世界。在你们自己的架构之外是不需要像房子或居室之类的，但是在出神状态或梦与其他实相相遇时，却常会看到这种结构。它们是资料转变成对你们有意义的方式。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:30.) The symbolism of the gods, the idea of the gods on Olympus, for example, the crossing-over point at the River Styx ---- that kind of phenomenon was originated by the Speakers. The symbolisms and frameworks of religion, therefore, had to exist not only in the physical world but also in the unconscious one. Outside of your own framework, houses as such or dwellings as such are not needed, and yet in trance encounters or dream encounters with other realities, such structures are frequently seen. They are transformations of data into terms that will be meaningful to you.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">举例来说，在死后，一个人——一群人——也许还继续造出这些，直到他们觉悟这架构已不再必要了。因此，“说法者”的活动不限于在醒时的意义。他们全天候的同时在醒时与作梦状态中尽他们的责任。事实上，大部分最重要的资料是受训者在作梦状态中记住的，也照这样传递下去。这些未被写下来的资料，因此也可以说，是由进入他种实相的梦中旅行或实地考察旅行时，以画面加以说明的。这种训练仍在进行中。个别的心灵架构或故事架构可能有所不同。例如，“说法者”可能利用通俗基督教的“上帝”与圣者的形相出现，全都是非常栩栩如生的。那么，作梦者有可能发现自己在一个极宏伟的后宫里，或反之在一光华灿烂的田野或天空里。有些“说法者”把他们的能力限制在梦境；而在清醒时多半不知道他们自己的能力与经验。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>After death, for example, an individual may continue to create these ---- masses of individuals may ---- until they realize that the frameworks are no longer necessary. The Speakers were not confined in their activities, therefore, to waking consciousness. In all periods of your time they went about their duties both in the waking and sleep state. Much of the most pertinent information, in fact, was memorized by trainees during the dream condition, and passed on in the same manner. These unwritten manuscripts therefore were also illustrated, so to speak, by dream journeys or field trips into other kinds of reality. Such training still goes on. The particular psychic or story framework may vary. For example, conventional images of the Christian God and the saints may be utilized by the Speakers, with all of this highly vivid. The dreamer may find himself then in a magnificent harem, or instead in a brilliantly Illuminated field or sky. Some Speakers confine their abilities to the dream state; and, waking, are largely unconscious of their own abilities or experience.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在9:40停顿。)称这种梦或梦中的所在为幻相是无意义的，因为它们是对你们尚无法看到其真面目的确切“客观”实相的描述。古埃及的宗教大半是建立于“说法者”的努力上，而他们花了很大的功夫训练“说法者”。可是，给予群众的外在展现却变成如此的扭曲，以致那宗教最初的统一性终于败坏了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 9:40.) Now it is meaningless to call such dreams or dream places hallucinations, for they are representations of definite “objective” realities that you cannot perceive as yet in their own guise. The Egyptian religion was largely based upon the work of the Speakers, and great care was given to their training. The outward manifestations given to the masses of the people became so distorted, however, that the original unity of the religion finally decayed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">可是，那时他们就在以之后从未再尝试的方式，努力画出内在实相的地图。在梦境与接近人世的一些其他存在层面里，在形相的创造及象征符号的卓越应用上，是真的有极大的个人活动余地。但在另一方面来说，所有这些都在一个“客观的”确切环境里发生，那个环境具有使这种现象成为可能的特性——那么，那个活动场所有它自己的规则。“说法者”是熟习那些规则的，而常常当向导。有时他们在组织内工作，像在古埃及，他们透过庙宇工作而变得卷入了权力结构。不过，一般而言，他们是孤单得多的独行侠。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>However, efforts were being made then to map inner reality in ways that have not been attempted since. It is true that in the dream state and in some other levels of existence close to your own, there is strong individual play in the creation of images, and a magnificent use of symbolism, but all of this takes place, again, in an “objective” definite environment, an environment whose characteristics make such phenomena possible ---- a field of activity, then, with its own rules. Now the Speakers are familiar with those rules, and often serve as guides. They have at times worked within organizations as in Egypt, where they worked through the temples and became involved with the power structures. As a rule, however, they are far more solitary.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因为时间的真正同时性，当然，他们是透过各种各样的“示现”，而在同时对你们的世世代代说话。举例来说，偶尔他们也做中介人，把一个人格的两个不同转世化身彼此介绍。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Because of the true simultaneous nature of time, they are, of course, speaking to all of your ages at once through their various manifestations. On occasion they also serve as mediators, introducing to each other two incarnations of one personality, for example.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们可以休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:51—10:04)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:51 to 10:04.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">物质实相内的法则说，物体看来是固定而永久的，可是其他实相的法则往往就大不相同了。在那儿，精神活动的本质将遵循不同的路线，而所谓时间的“连续性”将不存在，但是经由运用不同的心理组合，感知组织(perceptual organization)将会存在。(停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: The rules within physical reality say that objects appear to be stationary and permanent. The rules of other realities are often far different, however. The nature of mental activities will follow different lines, and “continuity” in terms of time will not exist. perceptual organization will exist by the use of different psychological groupings. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">纵使你能感知它们，这种系统由外面来看，对你们似乎是无意义的。你将无法观察到行动围绕着它发生的那些轴心点，于是那些系统里非常确切的法则，对你而言就会十分隐晦不明了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>From the outside, such systems would seem meaningless to you even if you were able to perceive them. You would not be able to observe the pivot points about which actions occurred. The very definite rules of that system then would be quite obscure to you.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">“说法者”对许多系统里的法则都很熟悉。不过，广义言之，大多数的这些系统仍旧是与你们自己这种实相有所关联的。内在宇宙多得数不清，而只有最高级的、发展到极点的完形意识(gestalt consciousness)才能觉知全体。那么，就这更大的范围而言，“说法者”必须被称为是“地方性”的。有种像是图表的东西，画出了许多附近的实相系统，我希望将来有一天能让你们得到这个。为了这样做，鲁柏必须更加强训练。有一些巧合点(points of coincidence)，在某种机缘下，可由这些点从一个这种系统进入另一个里。当然，这些个系统不需要在你所谓的空间里分开地存在。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now the Speakers are familiar with the rules within many systems. Still, however, most of these systems in larger terms are somewhat connected with your own kind of reality. There are an infinite number of inner universes. Only the very highest, most developed gestalt consciousness can be aware of anything like their totality. In this larger context, then, the Speakers must be called local. There is something like a chart mapping many of the nearby systems of reality, and I hope some day in your terms to make this available. In order to do so, Ruburt must be trained somewhat more intensely. There are points of coincidence where under certain conditions entry may be made from one of these systems to the other. They need not exist separately in space as you know it, of course.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:19)这些点叫作“交会点”(coordination points)，在那儿，一个伪装系统并入另一个。有一些“交会点”在你们的系统里有地理上的位置，但在所有的情形里，要进入“交会点”，必要的起步就是得“调准频率”：而这种进入只能在“出体”的情况中做到。每一个人在他的梦中对“说法者”所拥有的资料都能通达。在睡眠模式里发生的与正常意识邻接的意识状态，无法被你们的EEG收到——那个邻接的“走道”，你的意识经由那儿旅行。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:19.) These are called coordination points, where one camouflage merges into the other. Some of these are geographical in your system, but in all cases, a tuning-in of consciousness is a necessary preliminary. Such entries can only be made in an out-of-body condition. Each individual in his dreams has access to the information possessed by the Speakers. There are adjacent states of consciousness that occur within the sleep pattern, that cannot be picked up by your EEG’s ---- adjacent “corridors” through which your consciousness travels.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(EEG或脑波探测器能在曲线图纸上绘出脑波模式。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(An EEG, or electroencephalograph machine, traces brain wave patterns on graph paper.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">意识上以肉体为依归的那部分留在身体内，同时较高的直觉中心则被激发起来。自己的那个“缺席”部分不能由脑波模式来追踪，虽然在它离开与回来的那一点可能显出一个特殊的模式。可是，“出体”的本身无法用任何方法侦查到，画的线只显示在离开前的那一刻所显示的任何具特征性的模式。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The higher centers of intuition are activated while physically oriented portions of consciousness remain with the body. The “absent” portion of the self cannot be traced through brain patterns, though the point of its departure and the point of its return may show a particular pattern. The “time out” itself, however, will not be detected in any way, the tracings showing only whatever characteristic pattern was being given immediately before departure.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">其实这在每晚的睡眠中都会发生，它涉及了两个活动区域，一个非常被动，而一个则极端主动。在某个状况下，意识的这部分是被动的，在接受资讯。而在下一阶段，当它透过行动来参与时，它是主动的——那时它透过参与和实例，很鲜明的感知到所给予它的观念。这是睡眠里最受保护、最隐密的区域，在这里也最具有恢复活力的特性，而“说法者”就是在这一个阶段里扮演教师与向导。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now this happens in every night’s sleep. Two areas of activity are involved, one very passive and one acutely active. In one state this portion of consciousness is passive, receiving information. In the next stage it is active as it takes part through action ---- the concepts given it are then vividly perceived through participation and examples. This is the most protected area of sleep. The rejuvenating characteristics enter in here, and it is during this period that the Speakers act as teachers and guides.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(停顿。)然后，这资料在回来的时候常被自己的其他层面所诠释，如身体意识与潜意识，把它变成对自己这些区域有意义的梦。例如，一般性的教导可能被转译成涉及某一特定事件的实用性忠告。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause.) This information is, then, often interpreted on return by other layers of the self such as the body consciousness and subconscious, where it is formed into dreams that will have meaning to these areas of the self and where general teaching, for example, may be translated into practical advice involving a particular matter.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可以休息一会儿。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:34—10:45)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:34 to 10:45.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">睡眠有几个非常确定的阶段，而它们全都给人格各种不同的服务。它们也代表了不同层面的意识、领悟和活动。它们有一些身体上的变化相随，而有些变化是与年龄有关的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: There are several very definite stages of sleep, and they all perform various services for the personality. They are also signals for different layers of consciousness, realization, and activity. They are accompanied by some physical variations, and there are some variations having to do with age.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在我们下一章里，我再详细地谈这些。至于目前，你们只要觉悟到，在意识由外在实相转移到内在实相时，会发生特定的步骤、确切的改变，而这些改变不是无目的的；并且知道，意识是由一条非常可预期的路离开而到达它的许多目的地，就已经够了。世代以来，“说法者”一直在教作梦的人在这些其他的环境该怎么做，也一直在教他们如何带回能对现在人格有利的资讯。一个人按照他的意图、当前目标和发展的不同，对这些旅行可以有不同程度的觉察。例如，有些人回想得非常清楚，却常常因为有意识的概念而误解了他们的经验。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In our next chapter I will speak of these in some detail. For now it is sufficient to realize that specific steps, definite alterations, occur as consciousness is shifted from the exterior to the interior reality, and that these changes are not random; that consciousness leaves through a very predictable route to its many destinations. Through the ages the Speakers have taught dreamers how to manipulate in these other environments. They have taught them how to bring back information that could be used for the good of the present personality. According to the intent, present purpose, and development, an individual may be aware of these travels to varying degrees. Some have excellent recall, for example, but often misinterpret their experience because of conscious ideas.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">很可能一个“说法者”在作梦时，去给另一个作梦的人帮助，那人在梦境的一个内在实相里有些困难。当然“守护神”的概念与此有极大的关联。一个好的“说法者”在一个实相里与在另一个实相里同样的有效率，他能在物质实相里创造心灵架构就像在内心环境里一样。许多艺术家、诗人与音乐家都是“说法者”，他们精力旺盛地把一个世界转译为另一个世界，他们形成存在于两个世界之间的心灵结构——而这个结构在同一刹那能被不止一个实相所感知。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It is very possible for one dreamer who is a Speaker, to go to the aid of another individual who is having some difficulties in an inner reality within the dream state. The idea of guardian angels of course is highly connected here. A good Speaker is as effective within one reality as he is within the other, creating psychic frameworks within physical reality as well as within interior environments. Many artists, poets, and musicians are Speakers, translating one world in terms of another, forming psychic structures that exist in both with great vitality ---- structures that may be perceived from more than one reality at once.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在10:57停顿。)口述结束。现在你可以结束此节，如果你想问问题也可以。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 10:57.) End of dictation. Now you may end the session or ask questions if you prefer.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“你有没有什么要说的事？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Have you got anything you want to say?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">没什么特别要说的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Not specifically.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好吧，那么就结束好了。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Well, we might as well end it then.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">给你俩我最衷心的祝福，晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>My heartiest regards to you both, and a fond good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“也祝你晚安，赛斯。非常感谢你。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Same to you, Seth. Thank you very much.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">鲁柏应该做他知道他喜欢的食物。是的，并且对他的伙食多操点心。告诉他，要以创造的角度去想食物及准备食物。他对食物最不关心，他因必要才吃。叫他多以创造性的角度去准备他所喜爱的好吃食物，强调一种被人忘怀的老模式。当他那样想时会比较喜欢烹饪。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Ruburt should fix foods that he knows he likes. Yes, and fuss with his table a bit. Think of food and its preparation in creative terms, tell him. Food comes last. He eats because he must. Have him think more in terms of the creative preparation of pleasant foods he likes, an emphasis on an old forgotten pattern. He enjoys cooking when he thinks in that fashion.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">让他以美食来怂恿自己，那样他才不会觉得他在强迫自己进食。他喜欢肉汁和洋芋，但为了你不喜欢所以没做。他会喜欢奶油的。那么，在此处有你们需要协调的地方。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Let him coax himself with pleasant foods. He will not feel he is force-feeding himself then. He likes gravy and potatoes, but does not bother because of you. He will enjoy the cream. There are patterns to work on here, then.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">一项小嗜好。在不同的情况下烹饪可以成为他的一个嗜好，因此就指望那个吧。这与我要他做的运动一样都是强调身体方面的。现在晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>A minor hobby.
