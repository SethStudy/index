(今晚这节开始得晚，因为珍和我先去参加了为ESP班一个同学结婚二十五周年纪念所开的惊奇宴会，那是个很棒的宴会。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(The session began late this evening because Jane and I first attended a twenty-fifth wedding anniversary surprise party for a member of ESP class. The affair was a great success.</details>
(今晚在晚餐桌上，我们在臆测赛斯给的关于他当教宗那生的时间问题，他同时在1971年5月15日的ESP班上以及本章的第588节里谈到过。当我在奇怪不知我猜赛斯当教宗的转世可能在第四世纪里发生是否正确时，珍说她“得到”公元325这一年。这看起来像是个认可。令我们更惊奇的是，赛斯在今晚的课里又增加了有关那一世的资料。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(At the supper table this evening we had been speculating about the times Seth had given in connection with his life as a pope, both in the ESP class session for May 25, 1971, and the 588th session in this chapter. When I wondered if I was right in thinking it likely that Seth’s papal incarnation took place in the fourth century, Jane said she “got” the year A.D. 325. This seemed like a confirmation. To our further surprise, Seth added to the data concerning that life in tonight’s session.)</details>
晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Good evening.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
是在三百多年。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It was in the 300’s.</details>
(“谢谢你。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Thank you.”)</details>
为了你们自己的“启发”，我再提供几个额外的小注。在那个时期以及之后的一段时间，记录常常是非常不可靠的。它们被假造了。有时会以一个人的名字代表一个包含好些年的朝代。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>A few extra notes for your own edification. Often during that time, and for some time afterward, the records are rather unreliable. They were doctored. Sometimes the name of one man would be given as a reign covering a span of years.</details>
最初在位的那个人可能被暗杀了。另一人取代其位继续下去，就老百姓来说，好像没发生过变化的样子。下毒是常用的手段，甚至那些略微觉察实情的人也不敢明言。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The original man may have been assassinated, another taking his place, carrying on as if there had been no change as far as the populace was concerned. Poison was the usual method, and even those who suspected the truth would not dare speak out.</details>
记录上会显示是一个教宗的一个朝代，但一个、两个甚或三个不同的人可能曾任其位。政策上的改变——摇摆不定——是这种情形的一个线索。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The records would show one reign of one pope; but one, two, or even three different men may have filled the position. A change of policy is the clue in such cases; vacillation.</details>
现在等我们一会儿。(在10:11停顿。)也有些被称为“小教宗”(Little Popes)的人，那些人在受一种很具野心的训练，而且被人巴结着。你懂吗？如果他们认真地竞选，拥戴他们的人会得到很大的报酬。附带地说，这些人的行为跟其余的老百姓比并不特别坏。只是他们的地位给了他们较大的活动余地。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now give us time. (Pause at 10:11.) There were also men called “Little Popes,” those in training of an ambitious nature, and catered to. If they were seriously in the running, you see, the rewards would be great to their followers. These men, incidentally, were no worse, particularly, in their actions than the rest of the populace. Their positions simply gave them greater leeway.</details>
当我回忆我那时的生活时，就联想起了325与375这两个时间。再说一次，名字和日期对我现在并没什么意义。在那一辈子，我学会去了解人们与他们雄心之间的相互作用，那常存在于理想与实际行动之间的鸿沟。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The dates 325 and 375 come to mind in connection with my own life at that time. Again, the names and dates have little meaning to me now. In that life I learned to understand the interplay between men and their ambitions, the gulf that often exists between ideals and practical action.</details>
你也必须了解在那些日子里，宗教离不开政治，人人期望任神职者是个极佳的政客。我似乎曾在一个听起来像是Caprina的地方待过一阵子，也是在那一世。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You must also understand that politics was a legitimate hand of the church in those days, and a churchman was expected to be an excellent politician. I seem to have spent some time in a place that sounds like Caprina, also during that lifetime.</details>
(在10:20停顿很久。)一个兄弟或堂兄弟对我很重要。他结果陷于严重的困境，在对西班牙的某些走私生意上被逮到。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Long pause at 10:20.) A cousin or brother was important to me. He ended up in severe difficulties, caught in some smuggling business to the Spanish.</details>
在那时有个秘密团体叫做“神之母性的信徒”(Followers of the Motherhood of God)。他们被认为是异教徒，好几次有人送上反对他们的陈情书。这与教会教条里“童贞圣母”的地位有关。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There was at the time a secret group called “Followers of the Motherhood of God.” They were considered heretics, and several times petitions were given to me against them. This concerned the position of “the Virgin” within the dogma of the church.</details>
现在我们已讲完了这些注，你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now we are finished with those notes and you may take a break.</details>
(10:25。“我知道他在讲那些事。”珍说，然后补充说她只是随他去。她的步调一直相当的慢，但当她在10:32继续时快了起来。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:25. “I knew he was doing that,” Jane said, then added that she just went along with it. Her pace had been rather slow, but picked up when she resumed at 10:32.)</details>
现在：我们继续口述。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now. We will resume dictation.</details>
你们并没有命定要溶解到“一切万有”里。如你目前所了解的，你人格的种种面貌将被保留。“一切万有”是“个人性”的创造者，并非毁灭它的方法。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You are not fated to dissolve into All That Is. The aspects of your personality as you presently understand them will be retained. All That Is is the creator of individuality, not the means of its destruction.</details>
我自己“先前”的人格并没有溶解到我里面，正如你“过去”的人格也没有溶解到你里面一样。全都活着而且充满活力。全都走他们自己的路。你“将来的”人格与你过去的一样真实。过一阵子之后，你们就不会再为这事操心了。在转世的架构里，你所想象的死是不存在的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My own “previous” personalities are not dissolved into me any more than your “past” personalities. All are living and vital. All go their own way. Your “future” personalities are as real as your past ones. After a while, this will no longer concern you. Out of the reincarnational framework, there is no death as you think of it.</details>
不过，我自己的参考架构已不再贯注于我的转世人生上了。我已把注意力转到了别的方向。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My own frame of reference, however, is no longer focused on my reincarnational existences. I have turned my attention in other directions.</details>
既然所有的生生世世都是同时的，全都在同时发生，那么任何的分离全都是心理上的分离。我如我现在这样子存在，同时转世的人生——以你们的话来说——也仍然存在。但我现在并不关心它们，却把我的注意力转而集中在其他的活动区域里了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Since all lives are simultaneous, all happening at once, then any separation is a psychological one. I exist as I am while my reincarnational lives ---- in your terms ---- still exist. Yet now I am not concerned with them, but turn my concentration into other areas of activity.</details>
(10:41)不管人格是在一个身体之内或之外，它都会改变，因此你在死后会变，正如你在死前会变一样。以那种方式来说，若在死后仍坚持要维持你现在这样是很可笑的。就像一个孩子说“我会长大，但我永不会改变我现有的概念”一样。心灵的多次元特质允许它经验到无止境的次元。在一个次元里的经验不会否定在另一个次元中的生活。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:41.) Personality changes whether it is within a body or outside of it, so you will change after death as you change before it. In those terms, it is ridiculous to insist upon remaining as you are now, after death. It is the same as a child saying: “I am going to grow up, but I am never going to change the ideas that I have now.” The multidimensional qualities of the psyche allow it to experience an endless realm of dimensions. Experience in one dimension in no way negates existence in another.</details>
你们一直试图把灵魂挤进对存在本质之太窄的观念里，使它遵循你们狭窄的信念。岂知，通往灵魂之门是开放的，而它导向经验的所有次元。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You have been trying to squeeze the soul into tight concepts of the nature of existence, making it follow your limited beliefs. The door to the soul is open, and it leads to all the dimensions of experience.</details>
(10:50)可是，如果你认为你所知的灵魂是你自己的结尾或结论，那么你也想象你的灵魂是个有限的存有，单为它目前这一生的冒险所限，而在死后按照他在微不足道的几年里的表现而被盖棺论定。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:50.) If you think, however, that the self as you know it is the end or summation of yourself, then you also imagine your soul to be a limited entity bounded by its present ventures in one life alone, to be judged accordingly after death on the performance of a few paltry years.</details>
在许多方面这倒是个轻松而安逸的观念，虽然对某些人来说，它所含的“永罚”寓意可能相当可怕。不过，要暗示在“神圣创造力”核心里的丰富华美，它是一个太过干净的概念。灵魂同时站在你所知的肉体生命结构之内与之外。你并不会由于拥有一个永恒的内在意识而与动物和其他生命分了家。这样的一个意识是在所有生物之内，也在所有不同的形象里。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In many ways this is a cozy concept, though to some it can be quite frightening with its connotations of eternal damnation. It is far too tidy an idea, however, to hint at the rich embellishments that are at the heart of divine creativity. The soul stands both within and without the fabric of physical life as you know it. You are not separated from the animals and the rest of existence by virtue of possessing an eternal inner consciousness. Such a consciousness is present within all living beings, and in all forms.</details>
你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break.</details>
(10:55，结果此节就此结束。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:55 P.M. This proved to be the end of the session.)</details>
