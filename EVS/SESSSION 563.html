(这节又在画室举行。快九点时我们如常坐待课的开始，但珍没有立刻“感到赛斯在附近”。她并没有特别累或在任何其他方面有何不快……)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Again, the session was held in the studio. We sat for it as usual at about 9:00, but Jane didn’t “feel Seth around” right away. Not that she was particularly tired, or bothered in any other way….)</details>
现在：晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Good evening.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
我们再继续口述。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We will resume dictation.</details>
虽则，“鲁曼尼亚”文明是高度集中的，在于他们并没有企图征服他人或推展到较大的范围，但是几世纪以来他们确曾布置了前哨站，由那儿他们可以冒出来监视其他土著的踪迹。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>While the civilization of the Lumanians was highly concentrated, in that they made no attempt to conquer others or to spread out to any great extent in area, they did set out, over the centuries, outposts from which they could emerge and keep track of the other native peoples.</details>
这些前哨站是建造在地下的。从最初的城市和大片的殖民区当然有地下通道与哨站相连，是一个造得极为错综复杂而美丽的地道系统。因他们是个爱美的民族，地道墙上饰有彩画、素描，沿着这些内部支道还展示着雕刻。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>These outposts were constructed underground. From the original cities and large settlements there were, of course, underground connections, a system of tunnels, highly intricate and beautifully engineered. Since these were an aesthetic people, the walls were lined with paintings and drawings, and sculpture was also displayed along these inner byways.</details>
有各种升降系统，有的载人，有的运货。不过，建造这种地道到那些前哨站——相当小型的、自给自足的社区——是不实际的；它们有些距离主要的商业活动区相当的远。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There were various escalated systems, some conveying people on foot, some conveying goods. It was not practical to construct such tunnels to the many outposts, however, which were fairly small communities and relatively self-supporting; some were a good distance away from the main areas of commerce and activity.</details>
(9:25)这些前哨站散在许多地区，但有相当数目是位于现在的西班牙和庇里牛斯山区(the Pyrenees)。设置前哨站有许多理由，但其中一个原因是山区中住着体型相当巨大的人种。鲁曼尼亚人生性胆小，他们不喜生活在前哨，只有其中最勇敢和最有信心的才被派往，而且也只是短期性质。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:21.) These outposts were situated in many scattered areas, but there were a fairly large number of them in what is now Spain and the Pyrenees. There were several reasons for this, one having to do with the existence of rather giant-sized men in the mountain areas. Because of the timid nature of these [Lumanian] people, they did not enjoy outpost existence, and only the bravest and most confident of them were given such an assignment, which was temporary to begin with.</details>
(后来加的注：赛斯没有给鲁曼尼亚文明的日期。不过，有意思的是在1971年6月末，约在这一节之后八个月，报上登了个故事——还附有照片——关于在很接近西班牙边界的法属庇里牛斯山脉山洞中出土的一个“庞大的”近似人类的头盖骨。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(A note, added later: Seth gives no dates for the Lumanian civilization. It’s interesting to note however that in late July, 1971, about eight months after this session, newspapers carried the story ---- with photographs ---- of the unearthing of a “massive” subhuman skull in a cave in the French Pyrenees Mountains, very close to the Spanish border.</details>
(这头骨至少有二十万年了，代表了以前没被鉴明的一个种族。现在考古学家假想有好几种原始人在当时活在欧洲。那时期是在“尼安德塔人”(Neanderthal Man)之前，正当最后一次冰河季的前一个冰河季的开始。法国南部一带以有许多洞穴闻名，轻易地由流水侵蚀石灰岩床而成。珍对古生物学没有研究。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(The skull is at least two hundred thousand years old, and represents a race not identified before. It is now tentatively thought that several primitive races existed in Europe at that time. The period predates Neanderthal Man, and marks the start of the next-to-last Ice Age. This region in southern France is noted for its many caverns, easily eroded out of the limestone bedrock by flowing water. Jane has no paleontological background.)</details>
再说一次，这些洞穴被当作向外的门户，而往往看似为洞穴的底部即是用一种物质造成的，这种东西由外面看来不透明，而由内部看出去是透明的。当地土人用这种洞穴为天然的庇护所，鲁曼尼亚人因而可以没有危险地观察他们。这些人对你们的耳朵听不见的声音有反应。对暴力的特殊恐惧加强了他们所有的身体机能到一种可惊的程度。他们永远保持警觉和戒备。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The caves, again, served as doorways opening outward, and often what seemed to be the back of a cave was instead constructed of a material opaque from the outside but transparent from the inside. The natives of the area, using such caves for natural shelter, could therefore be observed without danger. These people reacted to sounds that are not audible to your ears. Their peculiar fear of violence intensified all of their mechanisms to an amazing degree. They were forever alert and on guard.</details>
(9:29)这很难解释，但他们可以以精神力把一个“念头”沿着某些频率投掷出去——一种非常卓越的艺术——然后在一个特定的目的地把这念头以许多种方式转译出来，譬如，译成形状或色彩，甚或转译成某一种形象。以一种你们不能了解的方式来说，他们的语言极具排他性，只因其音调高低和频率的层次及其间隔都是如此精确而复杂。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:29.) This is difficult to explain, but they could mentally pitch a thought along certain frequencies ---- a highly distinguished art ---- and then translate the thought at a given destination in any of a number of ways, into form or color, for example, or even into a certain type of image. Their language was extremely discriminating in ways that you could not understand, simply because gradations in pitch, frequency, and spacing were so precise and complicated.</details>
事实上，通讯是他们最擅长的事之一，而只因为他们深深地恐惧暴力，因而时常保持警觉，所以通讯能发展到这么高的地步。他们常以大家族聚合在一起，是为了彼此保护。孩子与双亲之间的接触也是在一个非常“骨肉连心”的层次，如果孩子稍有一会儿在他们父母视界之外，就会感到极不舒服。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Communication, in fact, was one of their strongest points, and it was developed to such a high degree simply because they feared violence so deeply and were constantly on the alert. They banded together in large family groups, again in need for protection. Contact between children and parents was at a very high level, and children were acutely uncomfortable if out of the sight of their parents for any amount of time.</details>
(9:34)因此之故，那些管理前哨站的人们觉得他们自己处在一种非常不舒服的情况。他们人数有限而且多半与他们自己文明的主要区域隔离了。因此，他们发展出一种更伟大的心电感应活动，而与他们头顶上的土地发展出一种密切交感，因此在上面凡事不寻常的最轻微震动或脚步，和最小的移动都会立刻被注意到。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:34.) For these reasons, those individuals who ran the outposts felt themselves to be in a very uncomfortable situation. They were limited in numbers and largely cut off from the main areas of their own civilization. They developed, therefore, an even greater telepathic activity, and a rapport with the earth above their head, so that the slightest tremor or footstep and the most minute movements above that were not usual, were instantly noted.</details>
常有所谓的窥孔通到地表，由那儿他们可以观察外界，他们还放了摄影机在那儿，不但对地球还对星星摄取最精确的图片。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There were frequent peepholes, so to speak, through to the surface, from which they could make observations, and cameras situated there that kept the most precise pictures not only of the earth, but of the stars.</details>
当然，他们对地下的天然气分布有完整的记录，对内部的地层也有密切的知识，对地震及断层留心地监视和预测。他们的降入地底下就如其他任何离开地球的种族所曾有的一样成功。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Of course, they had complete records of underground gas areas and intimate knowledge of the inner crusts, keeping careful watch upon and anticipating earth tremors and faults. They were as triumphant about their descent into the earth as any race ever was who left the earth.</details>
(9:40)如我告诉过你们的，这是第二个文明，也许是三个文明中最有趣的一个。第一个文明一般而言与你们自己的发展路线差不多，也面临了你们现在所面临的许多问题。他们大半位于你们称为小亚细亚的地带，但他们也向外扩散而旅行到其他地带。这即我先前提到过的民族，他们最后到别的银河系、别的行星上去了，而创建鲁曼尼亚文明的人民便是由他们而来的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:40.) This was, as I told you, the second, and perhaps most interesting of the three civilizations. The first followed generally your own line of development and faced many of the problems that you now do. They were largely situated in what you call Asia Minor, but they were also expansive and traveled outward to other areas. These are the people I mentioned earlier, who finally went on to other planets within other galaxies, and from whom the people of the Lumanian civilization came.</details>
现在我建议你们休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now I suggest your break.</details>
(9:43，珍说她的出神状态不大好。她曾吸过烟而画室的空气不大新鲜，所以我们把通向公寓其他部分的门都打开了。我们通常把窗关着，因为赛斯的声音有传得很远的奇特能力。此外，今晚也很冷。在9:53继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:43. Jane said her trance hadn’t been very good. She had been smoking and the air in the studio wasn’t fresh, so we opened the doors leading to the rest of the apartment. We usually keep windows closed because Seth’s voice has the peculiar ability to carry well. Besides, it was a cold night. Resume at 9:55.)</details>
在我们讨论第三个文明之前，我对第二个文明还想补充几点。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Before we discuss the third civilization, there are a few more points I would like to make about the second one.</details>
这与他们用图画来通讯有关，也与他们这种创造性的通讯所采取非常排他性的途径有关。在许多方面他们的艺术要比你们高超甚多，并且不那么孤立。举例来说，各种不同的艺术形式以一种你们几乎不知的方式彼此相连，而因你们对这观念是如此的陌生，以致我很难加以解释。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This has to do with communication as it was applied to their drawings and paintings, and to the highly discriminating channels that their creative communications could take. In many ways their art was highly superior to your own, and not as isolated. The various art forms, for example, were connected in a fashion that is nearly unknown to you, and because you are so unfamiliar with the concept, it will be rather difficult to explain.</details>
(10:00)例如，拿个非常简单的东西——好比说一个动物的素描来说吧！你看它只是一个视觉上的物体，但这些人却是伟大的组合者(synthesizers)。一条线不只是一条视觉上的线，而且按照一个几乎是无限种不同的区别和区分，它也代表某些声音，而被自动转译出来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:00.) Consider, for example, something very simple ---- say a drawing of an animal. You would perceive it simply as a visual object, but these people were great synthesizers. A line was not simply a visual line, but according to an almost infinite variety of distinctions and divisions, it would also represent certain sounds that would be automatically translated.</details>
如果他想要，一个观察者可以自动地先把声音翻译出来，在他还没管视觉影像之前。于是，在一张看来只是动物的素描里，可以提供这动物的整个历史或背景。在一幅画中，曲线、角度、线条除了它们明显的客观机能外，也全都代表了音调的高度、音色与音值非常复杂的变化系列；或者，你喜欢的话，可说代表了无形的文字。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>An observer could automatically translate the sounds before he bothered with the visual image, if he wanted to. In what would appear to be a drawing of an animal, then, the entire history or background of the animal might also be given. Curves, angles, lines all represented, beside their obvious objective function in a drawing, a highly complicated series of variations in pitch, tone and value; or if you prefer, invisible words.</details>
(10:07)线条之间的距离被转译成声音的停顿，有时也是时间里的距离。在图画里的色彩被用作像是通讯里的语言；代表了差不多像你们自己的色彩所代表的情感层次。不过，色彩强度之明暗被用来作进一步的修饰与定义——例如，或是加强由线条、角度与曲线的客观价值已传达的讯息，及加强由已说过的无形文字传达的信息；或以任何方式予以修正。此处你了解吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:07.) Distances between lines were translated as sound pauses, and sometimes also as distances in time. Color was used in terms of language in communication, in drawings and paintings; representing somewhat as your own color does, emotional gradations. The color however, its value of intensity, served to further refine and define ---- for example, either by reinforcing the message already given by the objective value of the lines, angles, and curves, and by the invisible word messages already explained; or by modifying these in any given number of ways. Do you follow me here?</details>
(“是的。”在10:12停顿。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Yes.” Pause at 10:12.)</details>
这种画的尺寸也有其信息。在一方面来说，这是种非常格式化的艺术，但就“细节”来说，它又许可极为精确的表达，就“题材”来说，它又容许极大的自由。它很显然是极度浓缩、精炼的。这技巧后来被第三个文明发现，有些仿制品的遗迹仍存在着。但诠释之钥已完全失落，因此所有你能看到的只是一张画，已失去了赋予它如此伟大变化的那些多重感官因素。它存在，但你们无法令它复活。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The size of such drawings also spoke its own message. In one way this was a highly stylized art, and yet it allowed for both great preciseness of expression in terms of detail, and great freedom in terms of scope. It was obviously highly compressed. This technique was later discovered by the third civilization, and some of the remnants of drawings done in imitation of it still exist. But the keys to interpretation have been completely lost, so all you could see would be a drawing devoid of the multisensual elements that gave it such great variety. It exists, but you could not bring it alive.</details>
也许我应在此提及，有些山洞，尤其是在西班牙和庇里牛斯山的某些地区，和更早在非洲的一些山洞是人工建造的。这些人且能以声音来移动巨物，如我先前告诉你们的，实际上用对声音的高度控制来运送物体，这即是他们的地道原来形成的方法，这也是他们在原先山洞不多的地带增建山洞的方法。通常，在山洞壁上的绘画是非常格式化的资讯，几乎像是在你们公共建筑前的标记，描绘出在某一区域动物和生物的类型。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I should perhaps mention here that some of the caves, particularly in certain areas of Spain and the Pyrenees, and some earlier ones in Africa, were artificial constructions. Now these people moved mass with sound, and, as I told you earlier, actually conveyed matter through a high mastery of sound. This is how their tunnels were originally formed, and it was also the method used to form some of the caves in areas where originally there were few. Often drawings on the cave walls were highly stylized information, almost like signs in your terms in front of public buildings, portraying the type of animals and beings in a given area.</details>
在你们通常所谓历史上的早期穴居人，后来把这些画当作临摹的范本。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>These drawings later were used as models by your early cavemen in the historical times to which you usually refer.</details>
你要休息一会儿吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Do you want a break?</details>
(“好的，我想休息一下。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Yes, I guess so.”</details>
(10:20。在珍说话时，我因她吸烟的烟雾开始咳嗽起来。她说她知觉到此点，虽然如此，她这次的出神状态甚至更深。不管外面气温如何，我们还是开窗让画室通通风。在10:33继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:20. I had started to cough during Jane’s delivery because of the smoke from her cigarettes. She said she’d been aware of this, but that even so her trance had been better this time. We aired out the studio regardless of the outside temperature. Resume at 10:33.)</details>
他们的沟通能力，因而也就是他们的创造能力，要比你们的更活泼、更有活力和更敏感。当你听见一个字，也许在你心目中知觉到一个相应的形象。可是，对这些人，声音自动地、即刻地造出一个令人惊讶的栩栩如生图像，它是内在化的，因此并非立体的，但的确比你们通常的心象要生动得太多了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Their communicative abilities, and therefore creative abilities, were more vital, alive, and responsive than yours are. When you hear a word you may be aware of a corresponding image in your mind. With these people, however, sounds automatically and instantly built up an amazingly vivid image that was not three-dimensional by any means, being internalized, but was far more vivid than your usual Mental images indeed.</details>
再次的，某些声音被用来指示，在时间与空间中，物体在尺寸、形状、方向与存在的久暂上，令人惊奇的微细差别。换言之，声音自动产生灿烂的影像。因为这个理由，很容易分辨所谓的内心景象与外在景象，因此当他们坐着谈天时，他们常常颇自然的闭上双眼，以便沟通得更清楚，享受随着任何语言交谈的瞬息万变、瞬间的内在心象。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Certain sounds, again, were utilized to indicate amazing distinctions in terms of size, shape, direction, and duration both in space and time. Sounds automatically produced brilliant images, in other words. For this reason there was an easy distinction between what was called inner sight and outer sight, and it was quite natural for them to close their eyes when seated in conversation in order to communicate more clearly, enjoying the ever-changing and immediate inner images that accompanied any verbal interchange.</details>
(10:41)他们学得很快，而教育是个很刺激的过程，因为这多重感官的设备自动把资料印在他们心上，不是一次只能透过一种感官通道，而是同时用到许多种。可是，他们虽有所有这些长处，以及敏锐的感知，却有一个与生俱来的弱点。当然，不能面对暴力并且学会去加以征服，严重地妨碍了某种向外冲刺的特性。在这些地方能量被阻断了，因此他们确实缺乏一种有力的品性或“有力感”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:41.) They learned quickly, and education was an exciting process, because this multisensuous facility automatically impressed information upon them not simply through one sense channel at a time but utilizing many simultaneously. For all this, however, and the immediacy of their perceptions, there was an inherent weakness. The inability to face up to violence and learn to conquer it meant, of course, that they also severely hampered a certain thrusting-out characteristic. Energy was blocked in these areas so that they actually lacked a forceful quality or sense of power.</details>
我并不一定是指肉体上的力量，但他们用了这么多的精力去避免面对暴力，因而，举例来说，他们就无法把普通的攻击性感受引导到其他的区域去了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I do not necessarily mean physical power however, but so much of their energy was used to avoid any meeting with violence that they were not able to channel ordinary aggressive feelings, for example, into other areas.</details>
现在我将要结束此节，或如果你喜欢也可以暂停一下再说。不过我仍建议你结束它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now I am going to end the session, or you may take a break, if you prefer. I suggest however that you end it.</details>
(我点头同意。)我最衷心的问候，并祝晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(I nodded in assent.) My heartiest regards and a fond good evening. (“Same to you, Seth, and thank you very much. Good night.” (10:48 P.M. Jane’s trance had been quite variable this time, and I had continued to cough. She said that Seth finally ended the session because her trance actually fluctuated as I coughed. The material was of a type, Jane added, that was difficult to get while she contended with such distr actions.)</details>
