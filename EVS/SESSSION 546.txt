<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 541,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第541节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>JULY 13, 1970, 8:40 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1970年7月13日 星期一 晚上8：40</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(No session was held for July 8th, as scheduled. Tam Mossman, Jane’s editor at Prentice Hall, called this morning to say that the first copies of her book, The Seth Material, have arrived at Prentice Hall from the printer. He’s mailing a book to Jane today.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在7月8号没有如期上课。谭·摩斯曼——珍在Prentice-Hall 〔出版社〕的编辑今晨来电话，说她的书《灵界的讯息》第一版已由印刷厂送达出版社。他今天会寄一本给珍。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(This afternoon, I gave myself suggestions that I have a projection experience when I lay down, but I did not succeed. Then, shortly after supper, I had a visual experience like that described in the notes for the 534th session, in Chapter Eight. I told Jane about it as it progressed. Once again she was concerned, but as usual I felt no alarm. The experience lasted for perhaps half an hour.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(今天下午，当我躺下时给自己建议要有个投射经验，但没成功。然后，晚餐后不久，我有了一次像第八章第534节课中所描写的视觉干扰。当它在进行时我告诉了珍。她又一次觉得很担心，但我却照旧不觉惊慌。这情形持续了约半小时。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(In Chapter Eight, Seth had said this was my way of trying to see models for my paintings. I hoped to see something really good this evening now that I was prepared, but nothing developed. The only aftereffect was a slight headache, as before, and this soon passed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在第八章中，赛斯说这是我试图看到作画用模特儿的方法。现在我既已有了心理准备，希望今晚能看到些真正好的东西，但并没什么发展。唯一的后遗效果是轻微的头痛，像以前一样，而这也很快就过去了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Maybe, I thought, the experience was a delayed reaction to the projection suggestions. Just before the session I asked my pendulum a few questions ---- keeping in mind that I wasn’t so sure this technique should be used to explore other than physically oriented data. Usually I get excellent results with the pendulum; I learned now that the visual-interference effects had been caused by my unsuccessful attempts to perceive a thought form sent out by a survival personality. This backed up the reasons given by Seth, then, for the eye phenomenon. Usually we use the pendulum to reach information that is just below normal waking consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我想，也许这干扰是投射建议的一个延后了的反应。刚在课开始之前，我用摆锤卜卦(pendulum)问了几个问题——我心里并不确知应不应该用这技巧去探索非物质取向的资料。我通常用摆锤得到极佳的资料；现在我知道视觉干扰的效果，是来自我想去感知一个死后幸存者所发出的心念形相的不成功尝试。那么，这印证了赛斯所给的关于这眼睛现象的理由。通常我们用摆锤来构到刚在正常醒时意识之下的资料。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I also learned that no particular painting of mine was involved, nor were my efforts to project this afternoon; that the survival personality was unknown to me, and that the pendulum couldn’t tell me who the personality was.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我同时也知道并没有涉及我哪一幅特定的画，也没涉及我今天下午想投射的努力；我不认识那幸存者，摆锤未能告诉我那人是谁。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(With this explanation, I didn’t feel it necessary to ask Seth about the experience. I did hope he would comment on it, but he did not…. Jane and I were both ready for the session ahead of time, for a change.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(有了这个解释，我想不必再问赛斯这件事了。我的确希望他会对此有所评论；但他没有……珍和我这次例外地都提前准备好上课了。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, I bid you an early good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在，我祝你们一个早的晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Resume dictation: Reincarnation involves far more than a simple decision to undergo another physical existence. In this in-between period of which I am speaking, many issues therefore are considered.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>继续口述：转世所牵涉的远比再经历一次肉体存在的简单决定要复杂得多。因此在我正谈到的过渡时期里，就会考虑许多的问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>When most people think of reincarnation, they think in terms of a one-line progression in which the soul perfects itself in each succeeding life. This is a gross simplification. There are endless varieties of this one theme, individual variations. The process of reincarnation is used in many ways, therefore, and in this time of rest individuals must decide on the unique way in which reincarnation will be of use.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当绝大部分的人想到转世时，他们以一种单线式的过程来想，在其中，灵魂在每个接续的生活中使自己完美。这是种极端的简化。这一主题有无数不同的个人变奏。因此转世的过程可以许多方式来利用，在这休息的时候，一个人必须决定他利用转世的独特方式。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(8:45.) Some, for example, choose to isolate various characteristics in a given life, and work on these almost exclusively, basing a given existence upon, say, one main theme. As seen from a physical viewpoint, such a personality would appear very one-sided, and far from a well developed individual.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(8:45)例如，有些人选择在某一生中孤立出种种不同的特性，然后几乎专门在这上面努力，可谓把某一生建立在一个主要的主题上。由物质世界的观点来看，这样一个人格看起来非常的一面倒，离一个发展均衡的人还远得很。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In one life the intellect may purposely be very high, and those powers of the mind carried as far as the individual can take them. These abilities are then studied thoroughly by the entire personality, both the benefits and the detrimental aspects of the intellect weighed carefully. Through experience in another life this same kind of individual might specialize in emotional development, and purposely underplay intellectual abilities.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在一生中，智能可能会故意地非常高超，他可以尽他所能地发挥那些心智的力量。然后那整个人格再彻底地研究这些能力，小心地权衡智能的利与弊。在另一生，这同一个人可能透过专门在情感上发展，而故意淡化其智能。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Again, the physical picture would not be necessarily that of a well- developed or balanced personality. Specific creative abilities might be specialized in the same manner. If you looked at these lives as a series of progressions in usual terms, then you would be left with many questions unanswered. Nevertheless the development does occur, but the individuals choose the way in which they prefer this development to take place.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>再次的，他在人世间表现出的，可能不是个发展得很好或很平衡的人格。特殊的创造能力也可能以同样的方式被专门化了。如果把这些人生看作一般所谓一系列的渐次进步，那么你就会有许多问题得不到解答。无论如何的确是有发展的，只不过，这些人选择他们偏好的发展方式。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(8:51.) Through denying themselves, say, intellectual development in a given life, personalities also learn the value and purpose of that which they do not possess. The desire for it is then born within them ---- if, for example, earlier they did not understand the purposes of the intellect. So in the time of choosing, personalities decide upon the ways in which they will develop in the following incarnation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(8:51)借由在某一生否定自己，好比说，智力的发展，人格也学到了他们所没有的东西的价值和目的。于是在他们内心便生出了要拥有它的欲望——举例来说，如果先前他们不明白智力的目的。因此在选择的时候，人格决定他们在下一生中发展的方式。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Some will choose progression at an easier rate and in a more balanced manner. They will help keep all the strands of personality working at once, so to speak, and even meet again and again people they have known in other lives. They will work out problems at a rather easy rate, rather than in, say, an explosive way. They will pace themselves as dancers do.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些人会选择以较轻松的速度及更均衡的方式来进步。可以说，他们将促使人格的所有部分一同工作，甚至一再地遇见他们在其他的一生中认识的人。他们会颇和缓轻松地，而非以一种爆炸性的方式解决问题。他们像舞者一样地调整他们的步调。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In this time of rest and choosing, all counsel is given. Some personalities do reincarnate before they are advised to, for many reasons. This is usually unfortunate in the short run, for the necessary planning has not taken place. But in the long run great lessons will still be learned from the “error.” There is no time schedule, and yet it is very unusual for an individual to wait for anything over three centuries between lives, for this makes the orientation very difficult, and the emotional ties with earth have become weak.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这段休息与选择的时候，你会得到所有的辅导和忠告。为了许多理由，有些人的确在他们被劝告再转世的适当时间以前就转世了。这在短时期看来往往很不合宜，因为尚未作必要的计划。但长远看来，由“错误”里仍能学到很大的教训。在两次投胎之间，并没有时间表的存在，但一个人若等上比三个世纪还要久，是非常不寻常的，因为这使得他非常不容易认识环境，而且与地球的情感牵连已经变弱了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The relationships for the next life have to be settled upon, and this involves telepathic communication with all those who will be involved. This is a time, then, of many projections. There are those who are simply loners, who reincarnate without any great feeling for earth’s historical periods. There are others who like to return when their contemporaries from some particular past historical time return again, and therefore there are group patterns that involve reincarnational cycles in which many, but not all, are involved.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在下一生的各种关系必须确定下来，而这涉及和那些将牵涉在内的人作心电感应的沟通。那么，这是一个有许多投射的时期。有些人根本是独行侠，他对地球上的各个历史时期并没有任何强烈感情地投胎。还有些人喜欢和他们在过去某个特定历史时期同时代的人一同回来，所以有些集体的转生模式，在其中有许多人——但并非所有的人——都一同卷入转世的周期里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(To me, now, at 9:02): You, for example, did not operate within a cycle in those terms. Now: There are personal cycles of course, in which families may reincarnate, taking different relationships to each other, and you have been involved in several of these.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(现在，在9:02时对我说：)你，举例来说，不是在那样的一个周期里运作的。现在：当然也有个人的周期，在其中家庭的成员可能一起转世，彼此之间采取了不同的关系，而你曾卷入几次这种的转世。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are different depths to be probed in reincarnational existences. Some choose to “go all the way.” These personalities specialize in physical existence, and their knowledge of this system is most comprehensive. For these there is a movement through each of your racial types ---- a requirement that is not laid upon most. There is intensive preoccupation with historical periods. Many of these personalities live comparatively short lives, but very intense ones, and they experience more lives than most other individuals. They return, in other words, in as many historical times as possible, finally helping to shape the world as you know it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在转世存在中可以探究不同的深度。有些人选择“彻底的投入”。这些人格专修物质世界的生活，他们对这个系统的知识最为广博。为了获得这些知识，他们需得活过你们的每一种种族——对大多数人是没有这种要求的。他们强烈的全神贯注于历史性的阶段。这样的人多半英年早逝，却活得非常热烈，他们比大多数其他人经历更多的生生世世。换言之，他们在尽可能多的历史时期中回来，终于帮助造就了你所知的世界。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:08. Jane’s pace had been fairly fast most of the time, her voice quiet. As she came out of trance we heard the paperboy coming up the stairs. I paid him.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:08。珍的步调大部分时候都相当快。她的声音很安静。当她回过神，我们听见报童走上楼梯。我付了钱给他。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Not long after these sessions began, several years ago, Seth told Jane and me that the three of us had experienced lives in Denmark in the 1600’s. Ever since then I’ve thought my interest in the art of Western Europe for that same period, embracing the work of Rembrandt and Vermeer, Van Dyke, and Rubens, et al., more than coincidental. I mentioned to Jane now my curiosity as to whether my artistic career had any connection with my Denmark life. I wanted to know my life span then, also.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(几年前，在这些课开始之后不久，赛斯告诉珍和我，我们三个在17世纪曾在丹麦活过。自那以后，我才想到我对那个时期的西欧艺术，包括仑布朗、弗尼尔、范戴克和鲁本等人的作品的兴趣并非巧合。现在我跟珍谈到，我很好奇我的艺术事业是否与我在丹麦那一生有任何关联。我也想知道我那时活了多长。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Resume at a slower pace at 9:20.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:20以较慢的步调继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Dictation. In one way or another you are all travelers before you begin even your first reincarnational cycle. To make it as simple as I can, I will say that you do not have the same backgrounds, necessarily, when you enter the physical system of reality. As mentioned earlier, earthly existence is a training period; and yet as far as possible I would like you to forget your ordinary ideas of progression.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：口述。反正，纵使在你还没开始第一个转世轮回之前，你们就都是旅人。我尽可能简单的说就是，当你们进入物质的实相系统时，你们并不一定必然具有相同的背景。如先前说过的，人间生活是一个训练阶段，但我却希望你尽可能忘掉你对“进步”的一般概念。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Ideas of good, better, best can lead you astray, for example. You are learning to be as completely as possible. In one way you are learning to create yourselves. In so doing during the reincarnational cycle, you are focusing your main abilities in physical life, developing human qualities and characteristics, opening new dimensions of activity. This does not mean that good does not exist, or that in your terms you do not “progress,” but your concepts of good and progression are extremely distorted.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如，好、更好、最好的概念能使你误入歧途。你是在学尽可能完全地存在。在一方面来说你是在学着创造自己。当你在转世轮回中如此做时，你把你的主要能力贯注于物质生活上，同时在发展人类的品质与特性，在开启新的活动次元。这并不表示“好”不存在，或对你而言你不会“进步”，但你们对于“好”与“进步”的观念是极度歪曲的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now many personalities have extraordinary talents along specific lines, and these may show up again and again in succeeding existences. They may be tempered, used in various combinations, and yet overall still remain a personality’s strongest mark of individuality and uniqueness. While most people adopt different trades, occupations, and interests, for example, throughout the reincarnational cycle, with some there will be a very noticeable line of continuity. It may be broken occasionally, but it is always there. They may be priests or teachers, for example, almost exclusively.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>且说许多人格在某些特殊方面有不同凡响的才能，这些才能可能在接下去的生生世世中一再地显现。它们可能被调节加减，以各种不同的组合被用到，但整个说来仍然是这个人的个人性与独特性最突出的记号。例如，在全部的转世轮回过程中，虽然大多数人采取了不同的营生、职业与兴趣，就某些人来说，却有一条非常明显的连贯线。它偶尔会中断，但总是在那儿的。例如，他们可能几乎专门做神父或老师。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There will be some more material in this book dwelling specifically upon reincarnation, but here I want to point out that in this time of choosing between lives, many more issues are at stake than a simple matter of proposed rebirth.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在本书中将有更多专谈转世的资料，但此地我想指出，在两世之间的这个选择时期，有许多利害攸关的问题，不只是计划投胎那样简单的一件事而已。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>On occasion, some personalities may be given an exception to the general rule and take a sabbatical (humorously) from reincarnations, a side trip so to speak, to another layer of reality, and then return. Such cases are not common, however. Such matter are also decided at this time. Those who choose to leave this system, whose reincarnational cycles are finished, have many more decisions to make.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有时候，有些人格也许会被给予一个常规之外的休假，(幽默地：)可以说是抽空到实相的其他层面作一次去而复返的旅行。不过，这种情形并不常有。这种事也是在此时决定的。那些转世轮回已完而选择离开这系统的人，有更多的决定要作。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Entering the field of Probabilities can be compared to entering the reincarnational cycle. There will be a sustained focus of awareness and existence in an entirely different sort of reality. Powers latent but barely glimpsed within the multidimensional personality are drawn upon and used when such a choice is made.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>进入可能性的场域(field of probabilties)，可以与进入转世轮回相比。在一个完全不同类的实相中，将有一个持续不变的知觉焦点与存在。当作了这样一个选择之后，在多次元人格内本就潜在而鲜少被你瞥见的力量将被汲取和利用。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The psychological experience varies considerably from that you know, and yet there are hints of it within your own psyche. Here the personality must learn to group events in an entirely different way, and completely without any reliance upon the time structure as you know it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在可能系统里的心理经验与你所知的有相当的差异，但在你自己的心灵内已有对它的暗示。此处人格必须学着以完全不同的方式来组合事件，而毫不仰仗你所知的时间结构。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:40.) In this one, as in no other reality, intellectual and intuitive abilities finally work so well together that there is little distinction between them. The self that decides upon reincarnational existence is the same self who chooses experience within the probable system. The structure of personality, however, within the system is quite different. The personality structures with which you are familiar are but one variety of the many forms of awareness available to you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:40)在这个实相，理解与直觉的能力终于合作得这么好，以致于在它们之间鲜少区别，这是在别的实相里都没有的情形。那个决定过转世生活的你，与选择获得可能系统内的经验的你，是同一个“人”。不过，在系统之内的人格结构是十分不同的。你所熟知的人格结构只是你可用的许多知觉形式之一。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The probable system, therefore, is as complicated as the reincarnational one. Now I have told you that all action is simultaneous; therefore, on the one hand, you exist in both systems at once. However, to explain to you that decisions are involved, and to separate these events, I must simplify them to some degree. Put it this way: A portion of the whole self focuses in reincarnational cycles and handles developments there. Another portion focuses in Probabilities and handles developments there.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，可能的系统就像转世系统一样的复杂。我告诉过你所有的行动都是同时发生的；因此，一方面来说，你同时存在于两个系统里。可是，为了向你解释这牵涉到“作决定”，并且为了分别这些事件，我必须把它们简化到某个程度。这样说吧：“全我”的一部分贯注于轮回中而处理那里的发展。另一部分贯注于可能性而处理那里的发展。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In parentheses: (There is also a probable system, of course, in which no reincarnational cycles exist, and a cycle of reincarnations in which no Probabilities exist.) The openness and flexibility of the personality is highly important. Doorways to existences can be opened, and the personality can refuse to see them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>括号起来：(当然，还有一个可能系统，在其中没有转世轮回存在，以及一个转世的轮回，其中没有可能性存在。)人格的开放与弹性是极为重要的。朝向各种存在的门户可以是开放的，而人格可以拒绝看见它们。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>On the other hand, all probable existence is open, and consciousness can make a door where there was none in those terms. There are guides and teachers in this time of choosing and decision, to point out alternatives and to explain the nature of existence. All personalities are not at the same level of development. There are therefore advanced teachers and teachers at “lower” levels.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>另一方面来说，所有可能的存在都是开放的，而意识却能在本来根本没门的地方造出一个门来。在这个选择和决定的时候，有向导与老师来指出选择的余地，来解释存在的本质。所有的人格并非在同一个发展层面上，因此有高级班老师与“较低”层面的老师。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:51.) But this is not a time of confusion, but of great illumination, and unbelievable challenge. There will be later material in this book on the god concept that will help you understand some things that remain unsaid in this chapter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:51)但这并不是惶惑混乱的时候，而是具有伟大的觉醒与不可置信挑战的时候。稍后在本书中将谈到神的观念，会增进你对在此章末说到的一些事的了解。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now for those who choose to recombine, “mix or match,” events from the immediately past life ---- to try it over in new ways for example, lessons must also be given. In many of these cases there is a severe problem and a certain rigidity coupled with the perfectionist characteristics mentioned earlier.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>至于对那些选择将最近一次的前生事件重新组合，“混杂或配对”——好比说以新的方法再加尝试——的人，也会给予教导。在许多这些案例中，有严重的问题和某种的顽固僵化，加上前面提过的追求完美特性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The earth years will be experienced again, but not necessarily in continuity. The events may be used in any way the individual chooses; altered, played back the way they happened for contrast; the way, perhaps, an actor would play an old movie in which he appeared over again in order to study it. Only in this case, of course, the actor can change his approach or the ending. He has full freedom with the events within those years.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他们将再一次经历人世的岁月，但不一定是以连续性的方式。个人可以选择任何方式来用那些事件；改变事件，把它重映一遍以见对比；有点像是一个演员再次放映他演出的老电影来研究它一样。只是在这例子里，这演员当然能改变他的演出或是电影的结尾。他对那些年里的事件有完全的自由去处理。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The other actors, however, are thought forms, unless a few contemporaries join in the affair together.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>但是，其他的演员们只是“心念形相”而已，除非几个同时代的人一同参与其事。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:00. During the last delivery someone began to move into the apartment above us. Once out of trance, Jane said she had been bothered by the racket over our heads, but that she “held on to the trance” until break. Resume at the same slow rate at 10:12.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:00，在最后的传述中有人搬进我们楼上的公寓。一旦脱离了出神状态，珍说她一直被头上的嘈杂所扰，但她“紧抓住出神状态”直到休息时。在10:12以同样慢的速度继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Under these conditions the personality manipulates events consciously of course, and studies the various effects. The focus demanded is quite intensive.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：在这些情况下，那人格当然是有意识地操纵事件，并研究其各种不同的效果。这要求十分强烈的专注。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>He is told the nature of those who participate with him. He realizes they are thought forms, for example, and his own; but again, thought forms do possess a certain reality and consciousness. They are not cardboard actors for him to simply push around at will. He must, therefore, take them into consideration, and he has a certain responsibility toward them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他已被告知与他共同演出的人的本质，举例来说，他明白他们是“心念形相”，并且是他自己的“心念形相”；但再次的，“心念形相”的确拥有某种的实相与意识。他们并非让他任意摆布的纸版演员。因此，他必须考虑到他们，他对他们有某种责任。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>They will grow in consciousness and continue their own lines of development on different levels. In one way, we are all thought forms, and this will be further explained in the material dealing with the god concept. Understand, however, that I do not mean that we lack our own initiative for action, individuality or purpose ---- and remember also here that you live from the inside out. Then perhaps the statement will have more meaning for you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他们的意识将会成长，而在一个不同的层面继续自己的发展路线。在某一方面来说，我们全都是“心念形相”，在谈及神的观念的资料中将进一步地加以解释。可是，请了解我不是指我们缺乏自我自发的行动力、个人性或目的——在此同时要记住你的生活是由内而外的。那么也许这声明对你会更有意义。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now in this time of choosing all of these matter are considered, and suitable preparations made, but the planning itself is all a part of experience and of development. The in-between existence, therefore, is every bit as important as the period that is chosen. You learn to plan your existences, in other words. You also make friends and acquaintances in these rest periods whom you meet again and again ---- and only, perhaps, during in-between existences.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在在这个选择的时候，所有这些事都会被考虑到，而作了适当的准备，但作计划的本身也都是历炼和发展的一部分。因此，这过渡(in-between)生活的每个点点滴滴都与被选择的时期一样重要。换言之，你学习计划你的存在。在这些休息时期，你也与你一再遇见的人——也许只在这过渡生活的时期——结成朋友。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>With them you may discuss your experience during reincarnational cycles. These are like old friends. The teachers, for example, are themselves within a cycle. The more advanced ones have already encountered the systems of reincarnation and Probabilities, and are themselves deciding upon the “future” nature of their own experience. Their choices, however, are not your choices. While I may mention some other realms[realms] of existence open to them in a later chapter, we will not be involved with them here.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以和他们讨论你在转世轮回中的经验。他们就像是老朋友。例如，老师们自己也在一个循环里。较资深的那些已经接触过转世与可能性系统，他们自己也正在决定他们本身经验“未来的”性质。可是，他们的选择并非你们的选择。虽然在以后的章节中，我也许会提到可供他们选择的某些生存领域，在此我们暂且不谈。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now give us a moment. End of dictation. (Pause, at 10:27.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在等我们一会儿。口述结束。(在10:27暂停。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I yawned. Amused): Are you awake and alert?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我打呵欠。)(觉得有趣：)你还清醒吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“是的。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Then give us a moment…. We have two broken-up periods for you. One very brief, 1611 to 1635. This is Denmark. Then 1638 to 1674. In one of these the information is as I gave it (several years ago). I was a spice merchant, and well traveled. I also carried paint pigments, or what ended up as paint pigments. Now give us time. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那就等我们一下……我们给你两段分开的人生的资料。其一非常短暂，1611到1635，这是在丹麦。然后1638到1674。在其中之一，资料是如我(在几年以前)所给的，我是个香料商，云游四海。我也卖绘画颜料或成为颜料的东西。现在再等一等。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There was a group of three men, painters. We will get what we can. Pronunciation is poor. We are after a name that sounds like M. A. then Daimeer (my phonetic interpretation). I do not know if that was called Madaimeer. (With gestures.) There is a connection someplace here with music and a Peer Gynt suite. Do you follow me?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有一个画家的三人组。我们能得到什么算什么。发音很模糊。我们在找一个名字声音听起来像是MA然后是达米尔(我对语音的诠释)。我不知是否是马达米尔(Madaimeer)，(打手势。)这儿大约有点与音乐和“皮尔金组曲”的关联。你懂吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我懂。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Woods and charcoal. Coal fires. You, I believe, now working on the floor of a hut, involved in the final process of making charcoal. (Long pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>森林和木炭。煤炭的火。我相信，你现在在一间茅屋的地面上工作，涉及做木炭的最后过程。(停顿很久。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>A connection with Van Elver, though I am not sure of its extent.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>与范·艾尔弗有关，虽然我不确知到什么程度。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I’ve painted a portrait of Van Elver, who is the fourteenth-century artist [Danish or Norwegian] from whom Seth receives information on painting techniques.*)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我曾画了一幅范·艾尔弗的画像，他是个14世纪〔丹麦或挪威〕的画家，赛斯由他那儿得到绘画技巧的资料。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The name Wedoor (phonetic) and a Germanic firm who handled artists’ supplies then, and was also famous for the dyeing of cloth and clothes.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>威督(拼音)这名字和那时经销绘画用品的一家德国公司，在染布与染衣服上也很有名。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>To assemble this material is difficult. Not to get it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>很难兜拢这些资料，而并不难得到它。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Van Elver the younger. (The cities were) clearing houses for country artists, but many more painters did portraits of wealthy farmers and their land and establishments. These were hung of course in places of honor in the homes.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>小范·艾尔弗。(城市是)乡村画家的销售所，但更多的画家专为富农和他们的田地与庄园画像。这些画自然是挂在屋里最体面的位置。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Even the poorer peasants and farmers bought portraits of themselves, however, from perhaps less gifted artists, and many unknowns took payment for portraits in the form of room and board, and painted all the more slowly.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，即使是较穷的农夫也由较无天分的画家那儿买他们的画像，许多无名之辈以接受免费食宿来抵价，而画得越发慢了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane, as Seth, smiled and leaned forward.) Now, you were a minor artist of that nature for a period. Not, therefore, during your entire life. You did better than room and board, and purchased land where you determined to settle down.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍，身为赛斯，微笑而向前倾。)现在，你有一段时候是那种次等画家。不过并不是潦倒一生。你混得比只得到免费食宿要好些，便买了些地准备安顿下来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Two friends continued to travel and paint, however, and visited you occasionally, and you envied them to some degree. One became fairly well known at the time. His name was Van Dyck, but not the famous one. You loved your land but blamed it also, thinking that perhaps you might have been well-known as an artist had you not obtained it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，你有两个朋友仍继续旅行和作画，偶尔来造访你，你有些嫉妒他们。其中之一在当时渐有名气。他叫范戴克，但并非著名的那一个。你爱上你的土地但也怪罪它，认为如果你没获得它，你可能会成为一个有名的画家。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You thought you would settle down and paint on your fine farm, but instead you turned into a farmer, and a lecherous one at that. There is some connection here with your ambiguous feelings about money now, you see, and possessions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你以为你会安顿下来在你的好农场上画画，但反倒变成了一个农夫，而且是个好色的农夫。你要知道，这与你现在对金钱和财产的暧昧感觉有点关联。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Family name, as close as I can come: Raminkin, or Ra-man-ken (both my phonetic interpretations). The letters H, E, I, M. These form either the first name or were tacked onto the name just given. (Emphatically): You did my portrait then, too.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Raminkin或Ra-man-ken(两者都是我对拼音的诠释)是我所得的最接近的姓。H、E、I、M这些字母组成名字或与刚才所给的姓相连。(强调地：)你那时也画过我的像。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“That’s interesting.” As Seth, Jane pointed to my portrait of Seth; it hung on the wall behind me, so that she faced it as she sat in her rocker.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“那很有意思。”作为赛斯，珍指着我给赛斯画的像；它挂在我后方的墙上，因此当她坐在她的摇椅里时是面对它的。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You did a better job this time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你这次画得比较好。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“That’s good.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“那很好。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Give us a moment. That was my last full reincarnation, adopted then because I loved the sea, and it served a strong purpose in spreading ideas from one country to another. The men who traveled with me also took part in the seeding of ideas. We spread them about the world as it was then known.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>等我们一会儿。那是我最后的完整转世，那次我转世是因我对海的爱恋而采取的，而航海对于把概念由一个国家散布到另一个国家非常有用。与我一同旅行的那些人也参与了概念的播种。我们在当时所知的世界中散播它们。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Frank Withers(Watts)was a fragment personality of mine. He will continue, himself, to reincarnate and go his own way. Many of us leave fragment personalities as you leave children. Do you follow me?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>法兰克·沃兹是我的一个片段人格。他自己将继续转世，走他自己的路。我们有许多人留下片段人格像你们留下孩子一样。你懂吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.” Frank Withers(Watts)was the original name given to us when the sessions began in late 1963.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我懂。”法兰克·沃兹是在1963年后期，课刚开始时最初给我们的名字。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>And now I wish you a fond good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在我祝你们晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening to you, Seth. Thank you very much.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“祝你晚安，赛斯，非常谢谢你。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>And you must do me in charcoal sometime.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>哪天你必须用炭笔给我画一幅画像。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Okay.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的。)”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I may even appear and sit for you, though briefly.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>也许我甚至会现身坐着给你作模特儿，虽然只是短暂地。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“All right.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好吧。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:57 P.M. Jane’s trance had been deep. We’ve received little information on our past lives, preferring to wait on this endeavor for various personal reasons. We found the data concerning Denmark intriguing. Jane and I ended up unsure, though, as to whether I lived two short lives, or one longer life divided into two spheres of activity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:57。珍的出神状态很深。对我们前世我们只收到很少的资料，为了各种个人的理由，我们宁愿在这事上等一会儿。我们觉得有关丹麦的资料很有趣。虽然，到头来珍和我并不确知我到底是有两个短短的一生或较长的一生分为两个活动范围。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(This in turn led me to wonder if tonight’s session contradicted one held several years ago, in which Seth stated that I had lived to an old age in the Denmark life. Jane had been my son. Actually there was no contradiction ---- merely a misinterpretation on our parts. Seth goes into more detail on this in the 595th session, in the Appendix.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(这跟着又使我觉得奇怪，今晚的课是否与几年前的一课互相矛盾，在那节中赛斯说我在丹麦曾活到很老。珍那时是我的儿子。事实上并没有矛盾——只是我们这方的一个误解。在附录的第595节，赛斯对这事说得更详细。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I do a lot of drawing in charcoal in this life, too.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我在此生也画了一大堆炭笔画。)</a>
