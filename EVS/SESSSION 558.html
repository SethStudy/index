(这段课的摘录包括赛斯第一次提及“说法者”以及他们在转世过程中的作用，补充了第十七章的“说法者”资料。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>9:50 P.M. THURSDAY</details>
(这节的缘起是因朗·华及他的太太葛莉丝——ESP班的学员——要求赛斯帮忙解决一个涉及他们家庭的难题。在就那情况讲了一些非常有趣的资料后，赛斯在11:15左右热心地谈起“说法者”的资料。所有我们在场的人都很惊讶，如赛斯用到的“说法者”这术语，在当时对珍和我与对朗和他的家庭而言，都是没听说过的。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(This excerpt from the session contains Seth’s first mention of the Speakers and their functions in the reincarnational process, and supplements the Speaker data in Chapter Seventeen.</details>
我们已认识好几个前世曾为僧侣的人。现在(对朗：)在早于基督时代的一生，公元前1200年时，在东方，你是一个属于密教传承团体里的一员，你们是流浪者，足迹遍及小亚细亚。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(The session came about because Ron B. and his wife, Grace, members of ESP class, requested help with a problem involving their family. After winding up some very interesting material concerning that situation, Seth launched into the Speaker data at about 11:15. All of us present were surprised. The term “Speaker,” as Seth uses it, was as unknown to Jane and me then as it was to Ron and his family.)</details>
你们在脑袋里带着讯息和法律，那是在一个已几近于被遗忘的时代给予你们这类人之一的。这些是“道德律”。它们源自亚特兰蒂斯时代。在那以前，这些“则律”是来自另一星球的种族所给的。这种族与亚特兰蒂斯的起源有关。这些讯息被演绎为文字和语言，而在亚特兰蒂斯的时候被记载下来，但在那之后它们则是以口传方式传下来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We have known several people who were monks in a previous existence. Now. (To Ron): In a life in the east before the time of Christ, 1200 B.C., you were a member of a body of men who belonged to an esoteric heritage. You were wanderers and traveled also through Asia Minor.</details>
你们的人从他们的长者那儿学到那些“则律”，他们被称为“说法者”。你是个“说法者”。这是为何你觉得这么容易称别人为你的兄弟的原因。现在：特别是在你管辖之下的三个人(在朗担任监督的制造业工厂里)，是那最初一组人的一部分。你的太太、你的儿媳与你的儿子(这晚全在场)，也是那组人的成员。不过，你的太太与你的儿媳那时是兄弟。现在请等我们一会儿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You carried with you in your heads messages and laws that had been given to one of your kind in a time that was already nearly forgotten. These were codes of ethics. They originated from the time of Atlantis. Before that, these codes were given by a race from another star. This race had to do with the origin of Atlantis. The messages were put into words and language and written down at the time of Atlantis, but after that they were handed down by word of mouth.</details>
(停顿。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Your people learned them from their elders, and they were called Speakers. You were a Speaker. This is why you find it so easy to call others your brothers. Now: Three men in particular who are under you (in the manufacturing plant where Ron holds a supervisor’s position), were part of that original band of men. Your wife, your daughter-in-law and your son (all present this evening) were also members of that band. Your wife and your daughter-in-law, however, were brothers. Now give us a moment here. (Pause.)</details>
你在一个大动乱的时候旅行过小亚细亚，不论你到哪儿去，你都说法——那是指你说到伦理道德，你花了十二年的训练来记住这些道德律。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You traveled through Asia Minor in a time of great turmoil, and wherever you went you spoke ---- which means you gave utterance to the ethics. It took you twelve years of training to memorize this code of ethics.</details>
且说后来爱赛尼派的人也牵涉了进来。我对那个字没有把握。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now later the Essenes were involved. I am not sure of the word.</details>
(爱赛尼派是在基督时代活跃于圣地的犹太四支派之一。他们是一个和平、爱沉思默想的团体。圣经里没提到他们。如果赛斯指爱赛尼散播“说法者”的道德律在，好比说，公元一世纪，那么这当然是比朗在公元前1200年晚许多世纪的时候。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(The Essenes were one of the four known Jewish sects active in the Holy Land at the time of Christ. They were a peaceful, contemplative group. They aren’t mentioned in the Bible. If Seth means that the Essenes were promulgating the Speakers’ codes of ethics in, say, the first century A.D., then this of course is a time many centuries later than Ron’s life in 1200 B.C.</details>
(朗的太太，葛莉丝：“赛斯，我们在那时有没完成我们的目的？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Ron’s wife, Grace: “Seth, did we fulfill our purposes in that time?”)</details>
在那一生中，有的，你们必须给我一点时间。在那团体内有混乱、歧见。对回想到的字眼的意义有歧见。那团体变得分裂了。这团体的一部分旅行到我们现称为巴勒斯坦的地方，另一些人在下个世纪里移居了，而出现在南欧。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In that existence, yes. You must give me time. There was turmoil within the group, disagreement. There was disagreement over the meaning of the words that were recalled. The group became divided. One portion of the group traveled to the land we now call Palestine, and the other migrated, in the next century, appearing in southern Europe.</details>
有关“B-A-E-L”(拼出来)有个主要的扭曲。有个团体聚集在一起，把BAEL当作他们心目中的“神”。你(朗)是和另一个团体在一起。在丛林中有一个城市——M-E-S-S-I-N-I(拼出来)是我所能作的最接近的翻译。在小亚细亚，在那儿那时留有一个过去文明部分片段。一个新城市被建立起来而后来也消失了。可是，当老的讯息再一次以写下来的符号来表示时，就在岩石上留下了字迹。但你的同胞已消失了。而你直到现在才又找到他们。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There was a major distortion having to do with B-A-E-L (spelled). A group gathered together with Bael as their idea of God. You (Ron) were with the other group. There was a city in a jungle ---- M-E-S-S-I-N-I (spelled) as nearly as I can translate it. In Asia Minor, and fragments of a past civilization were then there. A new city was built which in its turn also disappeared. There were writings on rocks, however, as the old messages were once again put into written symbols. But your people were gone, and you are only now finding them again.</details>
(11:27。珍的出神状态曾非常好。她很难睁开眼睛，然后又很难保持它们睁开。她说，当在给这资料时她看见了形象，但现在却无法对我们描写。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(11:27. Jane’s trance had been very good. She had trouble opening her eyes, then in keeping them open. She had seen images while giving the material, she said, but couldn’t describe them to us now.</details>
(在十节课之后，赛斯告诉珍和我，我们也曾是“说法者”，虽然他没说到日期或国家，或是否珍、朗和我也许在重温建立在另一个也许非常古老时候的友谊。在我看来，至少在这一生，朗和我以相当奇特的方式相连：我们几乎同龄，许多年之前我们在靠近艾尔默拉的同一小城里长大；我们知道彼此的家庭——我们却没见过面直到1970年……<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Ten sessions after this one, Seth told Jane and me that we had been Speakers also, although he said nothing about dates or countries, or whether Jane, Ron, or I might be renewing acquaintances made in other, perhaps very ancient times. It seems to me that in this life at least, Ron and I encountered each other in quite a strange way: almost of an age, we grew up in the same small town near Elmira many years ago; we knew of each other’s family ---- and yet we didn’t meet until 1970….</details>
(可能是反映他早先的“说法者”习惯——那可能在一个主观层面还在继续——朗活跃于业余的教会工作，并对圣经与有关主题所知甚多。他对赛斯的一些资料详加解释，我后来则由各种参考书上查核其中部分资料。珍由于实际上对所说的历史时代毫无所知，对赛斯资料是如此发人深省非常高兴。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Possibly reflecting his early Speaker practices ---- which may be continuing on subjective levels ---- Ron is active in lay church work, and knows much about the Bible and related subjects. He elaborated upon some of Seth’s data; later, I checked portions through various reference works. Jane, since she knows practically nothing about the historical periods in question, was very pleased that Seth’s data was so evocative.</details>
(赛斯—珍拼出的神的名字Bael。大多数来源拼为Baal，可能发音如Beal。Akkadian形式的Bel则是用在古老的米索不达米亚。Baal——主——是古老闪族(Semitic people)的一些当地神明的名字或头衔。在基督诞生的好多世纪之前——按照叙利亚的楔形文字记载，早到公元前1400年——Baal崇拜出现在叙利亚和以色列。就赛斯对朗提及公元前1200年，以及在他的团体内对Baal信仰的冲突来说，这日期非常有意思，Baal最常是指生殖力之神，它用石头做的形象可能是代表阳物的。按照正统以色列信仰，Baal或自然崇拜是偶像崇拜，是对任何道德价值的否认。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Seth-Jane spelled the god’s name Bael. Most sources spell it Bael, possibly pronounced as Bael. The Akkadian form, Bel, was used in ancient Mesopotamia. Bael ---- lord ---- was the name or title of a number of local deities of ancient Semitic peoples. Bael worship appeared in Syria and Israel many centuries before the birth of Christ ---- as early as 1400 B.C., according to Syrian cuneiform texts. This date is very interesting, in light of the 1200 B.C. Seth mentions for Ron, and the conflict within his group over Bael. Bael was most often a god of fertility, its image of stone probably a phallic one. According to orthodox Israelite belief , Bael or nature worship was idolatrous, a denial of any moral values.</details>
(在我们谈论我们都毫无所知的Messini城时，赛斯回来了一下：)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(While we were talking about the city of Messini, about which none of us knew anything, Seth returned briefly):</details>
好，写下R-A-M-A(拼出来)，这是另一个城，再等我们一会儿，然后我们将真的说晚安了……<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Write down R-A-M-A (spelled). It is another city. Give us a moment and then we will indeed say good evening….</details>
(Ramah是几个巴勒斯坦城镇通用的名字，在希伯来文的意思是“高”。圣经典故把这名字与有些崇拜仪式中的“高地”相联。这些地点，以色列人排斥为不道德的，并且威胁到以色列的信仰，包括了不合法的崇拜对象——Baal的圣柱为其中之一。我由课后的研究中发现所有这些资讯，在那时我们对这些一点都不知道。在十一点四十八分继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Ramah is the name of several Palestinian towns, and means “height” in Hebrew. Biblical allusions associate the name with some of the “high places” of cultic practice. These sites, rejected as immoral and threatening to Israelite belief , contained objects of illegitimate worship ---- the sacred pillar of Bael being one such. I discovered all of this information through research after the session. None of it was known to us at the time. Resume at 11:48.)</details>
以你们的话来说，并且只有以你们的话来说，基督的来临本就是基督再临(Second Coming)。(停顿。)以那种说法——再次的，这很重要——只以那种说法，祂在亚特兰蒂斯时代出现，但除了几个幸存者还记得外，记录被毁了，也被遗忘了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In your terms, and in your terms only, the coming of Christ was the Second Coming. (Pause.) In those terms ---- and, again, this is important ---- in those terms only, he appeared at the time of Atlantis, but the records were destroyed and forgotten except in the memory of a few who survived.</details>
现在，再次地以那种说法，祂是个一再出现于你们物质实相之内的存有，但祂只在两次被认出来。一次是在亚特兰蒂斯，一次是在带着所有那些扭曲世代相传的基督故事里面。因此祂出现又复出现，有时让人认出祂有时则否。如我曾告诉你们的，祂并不是“一个”人格，却是个高度发展的存有，有时以祂自己的一个片段体出现。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now, again in those terms, he is an entity who appears time and time again within your physical system, but he has been recognized on only two occasions. Once in Atlantis, and once in the Christ story as it has come down to you in all of its distortions. He appears and reappears therefore, sometimes making himself known and sometimes not. He was not one personality, as I have told you, but a highly developed entity, sometimes appearing as a fragment of himself.</details>
在你们来说，祂把祂自己永恒地织入了你们的时空结构中，一再地诞生入血肉的世界，为其一部分同时又独立于其外，就如你们也全是它的一部分却独立于它之外。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In your terms he eternally weaves himself within the fabric of your time and space, born again and again into the world of flesh, being a part of it while also independent of it, even as you are all a part of it but independent of it.</details>
好，既然我们这儿的小朋友(朗的媳妇雪莉)在担心我吵扰了邻居(非常大声地)，我将作个我希望是温柔的微笑，并祝你们一个温柔的晚安，连同我可以给的祝福。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Since our little friend over here (Ron’s daughter-in-law, Sherry) is worried lest I annoy the neighbors (very loudly), I will smile what I hope is a gentle smile, and bid you a gentle good evening, with what blessings I have to give.</details>
(在11:55结束。珍的出神状态又很深，她花了一些时间才从里面出来。她说：“哇，我现在觉得那能量如此强烈，流过我，载着我走……<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(End at 11:55 P.M. Jane’s trance had again been deep, and it took her a while to come out of it. “Wow,” she said, “I feel that energy so strongly now, going through me, carrying me along….”</details>
(课后朗按照《圣经·马太福音》解释基督再临。他也告诉我们，耶稣在《马太》、《马可》与《路加福音》中好几次预言他自己的死亡与复活，以及导致门徒们的不安与误解。甚至在他被钉十字架之后，复活了的耶稣在种种不同的场合也没被认出。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(After the session Ron explained the Second Coming as given in the Bible in Matthew 24. He also told us about Jesus predicting his own death and resurrection several times in Matthew, Mark and Luke, and of the resulting uncertainty and misunderstanding of the disciples. Even after his crucifixion the risen Jesus wasn’t recognized on various occasions.)</details>

1971年1月5日 星期二<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>TUESDAY, JANUARY 5, 1971</details>
(这节随着班上讨论转世与可能性之后而来，赛斯的评论和学生们的问题显示ESP班的课互相调适的特性，并表明了它们的范围。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(This session followed a class discussion on reincarnation and Probabilities. Seth’s comments and the students’ questions show the give-and-take characteristic of class sessions, and demonstrates their scope.)</details>
现在：古老的罗马还存在，同样的，埃及与亚特兰蒂斯亦然。你们不但形成你们所认为的未来，你们也形成过去。人家一直在告诉你们简单的故事，而它们也是很动听的故事；但如果你们没准备好听到更多的事，你们不会在这房间里。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Ancient Rome exists, and so does Egypt and Atlantis. You not only form the future, as you think of it, but you also form the past. You have been told simple tales, and they are delightful ones; but if you were not ready to hear more you would not be in this room.</details>
你与所有你转世的自己，或人格，并没被囚禁在时间里。在你所认为的你现在的自己，以及你过去和未来的自己之间，有经常不断的相互作用。若非如此，那我不会在此说话，因为我并不是鲁柏过去的自己。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You and your reincarnated selves, or personalities, are not imprisoned in time. There is a constant interchange going on between what you think of as your present self, and your past and future selves. If this were not the case, then I would not be speaking here, for I am not Ruburt’s past self.</details>
每个人格都是自由的。时间在所有的方向都是开放的，否则像“可能性”这样的事不会存在。因此，你现在所采取的行动，可以帮助一个所谓过去的人格；所谓未来的人格也可插足进来，而在你疲惫的路途上扶持你。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Each personality is free. Time has open ends in all directions or such a thing as Probabilities would not exist. Therefore, actions that you make now can help a so-called past personality; and a so-called future personality may step in and help you along your weary way.Also, your actions now can affect the future personality as well as the past one.</details>
同时，你现在的行动可以影响未来的人格，就如影响到过去的人格一样。你必须试着伸展你的想象力来感觉这些实相，因为光凭知性你无法理解，“心理时间”是你感知这些事实的最好方法。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You must try to stretch your imagination and feel these realities, because the intellect alone cannot comprehend them. Psychological time is your best method for perceiving these actualities.</details>
你能感觉那些你未必能用语言形容的东西，因为你比你现有的大脑要多。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You can feel what you cannot necessarily describe verbally, for you are more than the physical brain that you have now.</details>
我不是个诗人，但如鲁柏的一首诗说的，将大脑想作你围绕着“内我”所形成的一个网。这网帮助你在一个时空世界里操纵，而且就如任何蛛网那样的混沌、不稳又脆弱——也在一个同样不稳的平衡中。你形成这个网，然后感知世界，但你的观点非常小，而你感知到的花园则非常的亲密。然而，你有更为广大的感知能力。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am no poet, but as in one of Ruburt’s poems, think of the brain as a web you form about the inner self. This webwork helps you manipulate in a world of space and time, and is as nebulous, precarious and delicate as any spider’s web ---- and in as precarious a balance. You form this and then perceive the world, but your viewpoint is very small and the garden you perceive very intimate. You have, however, far greater abilities of perception.</details>
我要你了解你的“内我”或“灵魂”的本质，因为它是实相的一个焦点，由它涌出了别的实相。它并不是囚禁在日或周或月甚至世纪的小小盒子里的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I want you to understand the nature of your inner self, or soul, for it is a focal point of reality from which other realities spring. It is not imprisoned in tiny boxes of days or weeks or months, or even of centuries.</details>
现在我让你们全都休息一会儿，我在一个“非片刻”(unmoment)之内就回来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now I will let you all take a break, and I will return in a moment.</details>
(在休息时，一个学生，Janice S.，想要知道赛斯是否为珍人格的一部分。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(During break a student, Janice S., wanted to know if Seth was a part of Jane’s personality.)</details>
鲁柏没法像我这么容易地回答你。我们最初是同一存有的一部分。我沿着我自己的路而他沿着他自己的路演化。因此我们俩都是独立的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Ruburt cannot answer you as easily as I can. We were originally a portion of the same entity. I evolved along my own ways and he evolved along his. Therefore we are both independent.</details>
(J.S.：“换言之，一个存有的所有部分都在演化？他们是否如‘一个整体’(One)那样发展？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Janice S.: “In other words, all parts of the entity are evolving? Are they developing as one?”)</details>
我演化以形成我自己的存有，鲁柏也将如此，但在你们来说，他尚未到那阶段。当然，在另一参考架构他已达到了。他也涵盖了他自己那些较未发展的部分，因他们全如“一个整体”存在。他自己的所有部分对这通讯皆有所知，只在你们来说，我能被认作——我曾告诉过鲁柏此事——是他将来的“第六个自己”；但这只是要让你们明白这概念，因为他将不会变成现在的我。那是不可能的。我是我自己。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I evolved to form my own entity. Ruburt will also, but he is not at that stage yet, in your terms. In another frame of reference he is, of course. He also contains those portions of himself that are less developed, for they all exist as one. All the parts of himself are aware of this correspondence. In your terms only, I could be referred to ---- and I have told Ruburt this ---- as a sixth self of his in his future; but this is only to get the idea across, for he will not become what I am. That is impossible. I am myself.</details>
有某些答案是不能诉诸语言的，却必须直觉地了解。但我存在并能通讯这个事实应该显示给你，以简单的说法，你人格的其他“较高面”有时候能予你帮助。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There are certain answers that cannot be given verbally, but must be intuitively understood. Yet the fact that I exist and can communicate should show you, in simple terms, that other “higher aspects” of your personality can help you out on occasion.</details>
(J.S.：“你一直在教‘转世’这门课吗？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Janice S.: “Have you always taught on reincarnation?”)</details>
教学是我的主要目的，但我并不一直都是老师。有一次我是个香料商，一个又肥又重的香料商。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Teaching has been my main object, but I have not always been a teacher. I was a spice merchant at one time. A round and fat and heavy spice merchant.</details>
(J.S.：“却很英俊。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Janice S.: “But handsome.”)</details>
(微笑：)我真不知拿你怎么办。早在当今这一代迷上了大麻以前，我们已学到香料能做什么。我们在大海上吸oregano薄荷而飘飘欲仙。(在1600年代)我们把香料带到丹麦；我们的确有些愉快的旅游。我们远探非洲南岸。我是个相当讲究美食的人。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Smiling): I do not know what to do with you. We learned what spices would do long before the present generation got hung-up on grass. We got high on the high seas, sniffing oregano. (In the 1600’s.) We brought spices to Denmark; we had delightful trips indeed. We explored far down the coast of Africa. I was quite a gourmet.</details>
所有你所谓的过去现在就存在于你内在，你能重新捕捉到你的记忆而发现你的过去。你并没被囚禁于时间里，除非你相信你是，而世上没有比“信念”更重要的东西。如果你相信你只存在于此生的范围内，如果你相信你命中注定要死与灭绝，那你在此生就不会用你的自由。在你的“过去”显出来时你否认它们的能力，但除你自己之外，没人把这枷锁强加于你。要了解你多次元的自己就是要去用它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: All of your so-called pasts exist within you now, and you can recapture your memories and discover what they are. You are not imprisoned in time unless you believe that you are, and there is nothing more important than belief . If you believe that you exist only within the context of this life, that you are born only to death and annihilation, then you will not use your freedoms in this existence. You deny their abilities when they show themselves, yet no one forces this bondage upon you but yourself. To understand your multidimensional self is to use it.</details>
(J.S.评论说赛斯不大给预言。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Janice S. commented that Seth did not give many predictions.)</details>
我并不是谨慎，而只是很实在。当你了解实相的本质时，你就了悟对未来事件的预言基本上是无意义的。你可以预言一些事件而它们也可能发生，但事实上在每一刻你都在创造未来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am not cautious, I am simply realistic. When you understand the nature of reality, then you realize that predictions of future events are basically meaningless. You can predict some events and they can occur, but you create the future in every moment.</details>
在你们来说，时间是可塑的。大部分的预言是以非常扭曲的方式作出来的；它们可能把公众导入歧途。不仅如此，而且即使当这些预言者全盘失败了，对“真理”却没有帮助。实相并不是以那种方式存在的。你能把频率调整而感知某些可能性，从而预言“它们将会发生”，但自由意志却永远在运作。没有一位高居在一座巨大象牙塔里的神说：“这在2月15日的八点五分将要发生。”而如果神都不预言，那我看不出我自己如此做的道理。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Time, in your terms, is plastic. Most predictions are made in a highly distorted fashion; they can lead the public astray. Not only that, but when the predictors fall flat on their faces it does not help “The Cause.” Reality does not exist in that fashion. You can tune in to certain Probabilities and predict “that they will occur,” but free will always operates. No god in a giant ivory tower says, “This will happen February 15 at 8:05.” And if no god predicts, then I do not see the point of doing so myself.</details>
(Annie G.：“那么对于预知梦你以为如何？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Annie G.: “What about precognitive dreams?”)</details>
有些是全然合理的。不过，常常是一个梦所涉及的暗示性导致了那事件，因此当这梦成真时，看起来仿佛你曾经看入一个已然存在的未来。反之，是你形成了那事件，没悟到在你睡眠的时候它才肇端。这问题无法回答只因有太多的枝节，但从这个实相的一刹那，你不仅形成且改变了未来，而且也形成并改变了过去。在“可能性”的运作里这点非常重要，因它意指你改变并影响所有的事件，而且你们的书都是一种好看的小说，只告诉你你对“过去”的目前概念。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Some are entirely legitimate. Often, however, the suggestion involved in a dream brings about the event, so it seems when the dream becomes real that you have looked into a future that already existed. Instead you have formed the event, not realizing that it had its origins at the time you slept. The question cannot be answered simply for there are many ramifications, but from this instant of reality you form and change not only the future, but the past. In the operation of Probabilities this has great significance, for this means that you change and affect all events, and that your books are a delightful fiction that tell you only your current ideas about the past.</details>
(Sally W.：“我要怎么样改变我的思想方式来使我的家人健康，而不是使他们生病？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Sally W.: “How can I change my way of thinking to keep my family well, instead of making them sick?”)</details>
回到这儿，我们有个从听众来的问题。(微笑：)你必须了悟你并不是独自形成事件，而是涉入一个合作性的冒险。那么通常你不应独自为一事件负责，因为他人也参与其创造——为了他们自己的理由。这问题不是在一个晚上就能回答得了的，但每个意识却都有它自己的防卫系统与它自己的活力；你应当信赖你自己的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Back here, we have a question from the gallery. (Smiling.) You must realize that you do not form events alone. You are involved in a cooperative venture. Usually then you alone are not responsible for an event, because others participate in its creation ---- for their own reasons. The question cannot be answered simply in one evening, but each consciousness has its own defense system and its own vitality; you should trust your own.</details>
经由你们所不知的方法，你们心灵感应地通力合作，以形成你们所知的物质实相。你们织出一张张心灵实相之网，它然后再结合成物质实相。你们并不一定是独自在织这些网，而是共同的。你的思想与其他人的思想互相交织。你对你自己的思想负责。你需要学习思想与情感的威力，但这应使你充满了创造的喜悦。你一旦觉悟到你的思想形成实相，那你就不再是事件的奴隶。你只需要学会那些方法就行了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You cooperate together to form the physical reality that you know, telepathically, through ways and means that are unknown to you. You weave webs of psychic reality that then coalesce into physical reality. You do not necessarily weave them alone, but together. Your thoughts intertwine with those of others. You are responsible for your own thoughts. You need to learn the power of thought and emotion, but this should fill you with the joy of creativity. Once you realize that your thoughts form reality, then you are no longer a slave to events. You simply have to learn the methods.</details>

你在这儿就学得到。你将由阅读及倾听你的“内我”来学习。这些方法千百年以来就已知；不只是如你所想的千百年，却是如你所知这地球的一辈子，甚至在那之前——当磁极是相反的时候，当天上还有其他的星星，当这些星球并非你所知星球的时候。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You will learn them here. You will learn them through reading, and through listening to your inner self. The methods have been known for centuries; not only centuries as you think of them, but for the lifetime of this earth as you know it, and even before ---- when the poles were reversed and when there were other stars in the sky and when the planets were not the planets that you know.</details>

(在休息时讨论到的问题之一是关于人类肉体的“永恒”程度。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(One of the subjects discussed at break concerned the degree of “permanence” of the physical human form.)</details>
在我们自己的课里，我曾解释了一些在班上未提过的事，以下就是：在这一个你似乎存在于这宇宙的片刻，你却并不存在于其中。原子和分子有一种脉动性质是你不常感觉到的，因此在你看来好像是持续存在的原子或分子，反之却是一连串你无法记住的脉动。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In our own sessions I have explained something that I haven’t mentioned in class, and it is this: For every moment of time that you seem to exist in this universe, you do not exist in it. The atoms and molecules have a pulsating nature that you do not usually perceive, so what seems to you to be a continuous atom or molecule is, instead, a series of pulsations that you cannot keep track of.Physical matter is not permanent. You only perceive it as continuous; your perceptive mechanisms are not equipped to detect the pulsations.</details>
物质是非永恒的。你只是感知它为持续的，因为你的感知机制并没有觉察那脉动的装备。现在，我是对我们这儿的朋友(Art O.，一位工程师)说话。因为他的背景，他对我在设法解释的东西也许能理解一些。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now, I am speaking to our friend over here (Art O., an engineer) because he may perhaps have a comprehension of what I am trying to explain, because of his background.</details>
(Art O.：“这些脉动在我们来说是否极快？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Art O.: “Are these pulses extremely fast in our terms?”)</details>
它们的确是的。但在某种情况下，“内我”舍弃了它通常对肉体感官的倚仗，就会对这些在你看来似为空无(negations)的时刻有所觉察。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They are indeed. In certain conditions however, the inner self, abandoning its usual reliance upon the physical senses, is aware of these periods that would seem to you to be negations.</details>
你的意识以同样方式起伏，它一下在这儿一下又不在这儿，但物质的自己只贯注于那些在物质实相里的片刻。可是，因为意识起伏，你自己的“其他部分”对那些当意识不是贯注于“物质实相”的时候有所记忆，而这也是你整个存在的一部分。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Your consciousness fluctuates in the same way. It is here and then it is not here, but the physical self focuses upon only those moments of physical reality. Because consciousness fluctuates however, other portions of your self have memory of those times when it is not focused in “physical reality,” and this is also a portion of your entire existence.</details>
这远不及它听起来的那么复杂。举例来说，不管你记不记得你的梦，你的某一部分，在催眠之下能记起在你一生中所作过的每一个梦。因此你的某一部分也记得那些当你不贯注于物质实相里的那些非片刻，当你的存在是全然在另一个真实的次元里时，而你在感知我将称之为——以你的参考术语来说——非间隔时间(nonintervals)的时候。我比较喜欢非间隔时间这名词多过于“非片刻”。它的确就在这一生里；而同时这些“非间隔时间”在其他的时间次元里是一段时间。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This isn’t half as complicated as it sounds. Whether or not you remember your dreams, for example, a certain portion of you, under hypnosis, could remember every dream that you ever had in your life. So a certain portion of you remembers those nonmoments when you are not focused in physical reality, when your existence is in another dimension of actuality entirely and you are perceiving what I will call, in your term of reference, nonintervals. I like the term nonintervals better than nonmoments.</details>

(Art O.：“我想到的比喻是有关电磁波的。一种整流过的载波，我们能觉察的‘间隔时间’是正波而‘非间隔时间’是负波”。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Art O.: “The analogy I get is of an electromagnetic wave, a carrier wave, and it’s rectified. The intervals are the positive pulses and the nonintervals are the negative pulses.”)</details>
这就是我为何针对你说的原因。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This is why I was talking to you.</details>
(Art O.：“脉动除了正负两者外，还有没有更多的？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Art O.: “Are there more than two pulses?”)</details>
有的，而全我对所有这些实相都有所知。你们全知道你们自己及你们的弱点与失败，那为何假设你所知的自己是你唯一的自己呢？我这样说并无不友善之意。的确，你一定想到过你还有没用到的才能，与你最深存在相连的其他实相也还没在你所知的存在中表现出来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There are, and the whole self is aware of all of these realities. With no unkindness meant, you all know yourselves and your weaknesses and failures, so why should you suppose that the self you know is the only self that you are? Surely, it has occurred to you that you have abilities you are not using, that other realities connected with your innermost existence aren’t being expressed in the existence you know of.</details>
(对Art O.：)我要你想想我所说“非间隔时间”的暗示。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(To Art O.): I want you to think about the implications of what I have said concerning nonintervals.</details>

正是，而他们不会感知你们在这儿的存在，因为对他们而言，它会是个“非间隔时间”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is, and they would not perceive your existence here, for to them it would be a noninterval.</details>

的确如此。某个晚上我会告诉你，你该改变你对“人生”这字的观念。这是我对一些相当重要的资料所给的第一个暗示，不论是在我们的私人课里或是班上都是第一次。只要想想当你用“人生”这个字时你指的是什么，就明白这用语是如何的狭窄了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Yes, indeed. And some evening I will tell you that you should change your conception of the word “lives.” This is the first hint I have given, either in our private sessions or in class, of some rather important material. But think of what you mean when you use the word lives, and see how limited the term is.</details>
我将结束我们的课。但我有一个短评。我以前说过：你们将来再也不会比现在更“死”。现在如果你了解那短评而思考它，你就会了解今晚我所说的背后许多事。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am going to end our session, but I have a comment. I have said this before: You are as dead now as you will ever be. Now if you understand that remark and think about it, you will understand much that is behind what I have said this evening.</details>
(Art O.:“那么我们过去也从不曾比现在更‘活生生’？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Art O.: “Then we are as alive now as we have ever been?”)</details>
那是正确的——只不过在你现在涉及的生活里，你并没有贯注于你活力的全部潜能上。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>That is correct ---- except that in the life in which you are now involved, you are not focusing upon the full potential of your vitality.</details>

有的。现在，我告诉你们记住你们的梦。在你们的范畴里，我再告诉你不只要记着你的梦，并且要学会在梦的中间醒过来，而了悟你能在它们之内操纵。它们是你的，并非什么被推到你身上而你对之无能为力的东西。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There was. Now, I tell you to remember your dreams. In your context I will tell you again not only to remember your dreams, but to learn to come awake in the middle of them and realize that you can manipulate within them. You form them.

(J.S.：“我们在用我们的存在像我们用梦一样吗？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Janice S.: “We are using our existence as the dream?”)</details>
我所说过的话适用于你刚才说的话。在某个范畴内你所称为“物质实相”的是个梦，但在较广义的范畴来说，它是个你创造出来的梦。当你了悟你形成了它时，你就进入你的“全我”的记忆里。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>What I have said applies to what you just said. In one context what you call physical reality is a dream, but in a larger context it is a dream that you have created. When you realize that you form it you come into the memory of your whole self.</details>
而当你了悟你以同样方式形成了你一生的事件时，你就将学会控制你全部的意识，不论它在此生以何面目显示它自己。透过所有这些，你必然会了悟你并不是无能为力的。你还要记住，这一生是个经验的次元和真实的次元，即使相比之下，它只是在一个较高层实相里的一个梦，在那层面你有较广大的意识。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>And when you realize that you form the events of your life in the same way, you will learn to take hold of your entire consciousness in whatever aspect it shows itself in this life. Through all of this you must realize that you are not powerless. Remember, also, that this life is a dimension of experience and reality even if it is, in contrast, a dream in a higher level of reality in which you have your larger consciousness.</details>

(此节的第一部分，有关班上的一位同学和她不愿更深入内观她自己的态度。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(The first part of the session concerned a class member and her reluctance to look deeper within herself.)</details>
她非常适当地在班上代表了你们每个人在某种程度都有的感觉，涉及你们的“内我”……她以一种夸张的方式让你们看到她的感觉，因此当她说话时，她不只在替她自己说话，也在替这房中的每个人说话，连鲁柏在内。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Very nicely in class, she personifies the feelings that each of you have to some degree, involving your inner self….

(对那人：)你的确替班上做了一项有用的服务，但我期待你态度的改变。因为当你开始向内看自己，你将为别人立下一个好榜样，而你也一定会那样做。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(To the member): You have, indeed, been performing a useful service in class, but I expect to see it changed. For when you begin to look within yourself you will set the others a fine example, and so you shall.</details>
(在休息时，珍念了有关诺斯提学说(Gnosticism)的一些资料摘录。随之有对上周课里赛斯介绍的资料——关于原子与分子的脉动本质——的讨论。这接着又导致大家去思考所谓飞碟现象之可能来源。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(During break Jane read excerpts from some material concerning Gnosticism. This was followed by a discussion of the data Seth introduced in last week’s class session, concerning the pulsating nature of atoms and molecules ---- and this in turn led to the consideration of possible origins for the so-called flying saucer phenomena.)</details>
一个小注：在某些方面，这些脉动代表了在你们某些飞碟事件里所发生的事，因为你们并没有像你们认为你们看到的那种交通工具。我现在说的只是某些案例，也就是当你们有来自其他实相的拜访者时。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>One small note: In some respects these pulsations represent what happens in some of your flying saucer incidents, for you do not have a vehicle such as the one you think you perceive. I am speaking of only certain cases, where you have visitors from other realities.</details>
事实的真相是：你们有一个想要彼此交换伪装实相的企图。进入你们星球的生物无法以他们的原形出现在其中。既然他们的原子构造与你们不一样，为了使接触成为可能，就必然得发生扭曲。因此你们就碰上了某一套的感官资料，然后你们便试想理解发生了什么事，但你要知道，这感官资料表示这事件已经被扭曲到某个程度了。你们常看到的具体交通工具，乃是你们对实际上在发生的事件的诠释。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>What happens is that you have an attempt to exchange camouflage realities. The beings entering your plane cannot appear within it as themselves. Since their atomic structure is not the same as yours, distortions must occur in order to make any contact possible. Thus you are greeted with a certain set of sense data. You then try to figure out what is happening but the sense data, you see, means that the event is already distorted to some degree. The physical vehicles that are often perceived are your interpretation of the event that is actually occurring.</details>
你明白吗？我们在这儿的朋友(Paul W.)，很可以用“不明飞行物”(UFO)的样子出现于实相的另一面而吓着那儿的居民。你们忘了意识才是唯一真正的交通工具。你的意识也没有任何一部分是囚禁于你内在的，它以一种面貌或另一种面貌具体化。我用“具体化”这个字是为了使你能了解，但它是扭曲性的，既然它会使你们以为是一种物质性的显现。但如你们所知，所有的实相却都不是实质的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Our friend back here (Paul W.) could well appear, you see, as a UFO in another aspect of reality, and frighten the inhabitants. You forget that consciousness is the only true vehicle. No part of your consciousness is imprisoned within you. It materializes in one aspect or another. I use the word “materializes” because it makes sense to you, but it is distortive since it predisposes an appearance within matter. Yet all realities, as you know, are not physical.</details>
举例来说，理论上你们任何一个人都可能扩散你的意识而变成屋中任何物体的一部分——或飞开去，把你自己扩散到太空里——但你对“本体身份”的感觉依旧在。这在你们来说是不实际的，但你们许多人却在睡眠中这样做以恢复精力。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is theoretically possible, for example, for any of you to disperse your consciousness and become a part of any object in the room ---- or to fly apart, to disperse yourself out into space ---- without leaving your sense of identity. This is not practical in your terms, yet many of you do it to gain refreshment while you are sleeping.</details>
意识就其天性而言，本就背负着感知的重任。这是你们习于想到的那种意识。在你们来说，你不能想象它没有感知；但意识仍能是有生命与活生生的，却无你们所谓的“感知”。那一句的最后部分很重要。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Consciousness by its very characteristics carries the burden of perception. This is the kind of consciousness you are used to thinking of. You cannot imagine it without perception in your terms; and yet consciousness can be vital and alive without your idea of perception. The last part of that sentence is important.</details>
(对Art O.:)现在，我坐在那边亲爱的科学家朋友，原子与分子对你可能显得很微小，却也背负着它们的意识与责任的重担。然而却有一部分的意识能快活地以一种没被它们本性所限的方式去感知；它能游戏似的感知，将感知当作它自身创造性的一面，而没有责任。以某种方式来说，甚至那在你周围的空气也以它自己快活的意识歌唱。它从不知道常常压迫你的那种意识的重担。(对大家说：)在你们来说，你们这么怕死，以致连一秒钟也不敢关掉你的意识，因为你们怕如果你们真把它关了，说真的，谁又会在那儿把它再打开呢？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(To Art O.): Now, my dear scientific friend over there: Atoms and molecules, minute as they may appear to you, also carry their burden of consciousness and responsibility. Yet there is a portion of consciousness that can joyfully perceive in a manner that is not dictated by its nature; it can playfully perceive as a creative aspect of its being, without responsibility. In one manner of speaking the very air about you sings with its own joyful consciousness. It does not know the same kind of burden of consciousness that often oppresses you. (Speaking generally): You are so frightened of death, in your terms, that you dare not turn your consciousness off for one second; for you fear that if you do, indeed, who will be there to turn it back on again?</details>
(Art O.：“在这意识的扩散上是否涉及：‘整个存有’？或只是我们现在所知的部分？)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Art O.: “Is the whole entity involved in this dispersion of consciousness, or just the portion of it we know now?”)</details>
这就是银河形成的方式。也就是宇宙扩展的方式，就是“存有”形成的方式。现在，那就是你的答案。仔细玩味一下这几句话吧！<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is the way that galaxies form. It is the way that the universe expands, and it is the way that entities form. Now, that is your answer. Chew that one over for a while.</details>
我很高兴今晚你们在思考，你们全体——那就是我要你们去做的。意念并没有实质性，除非你将它们化为己有。把意念当作朋友或敌人都行，跟它们争执或爱它们也好，但一定要运用并体验它们，并且不只是以你的知性，也以你的感受。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am pleased because you are thinking this evening, all of you ---- that is what I want you to do. ideas have no reality unless you make them your own. Make friends or enemies of them. Fight with them or love them but use and experience them, not only with your intellect but with your feelings.</details>
(Bert C.问到与自己建立关系及与他人建立联系的问题。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Bert C. spoke of relating to oneself and to others.)</details>
除非你能对自己诚实，而变得有意识地觉察你自己，否则无法诚实地与别人建立关系；因为你将会把自己的恐惧与偏见投射在他们身上。你无力帮助他们，因为你在自己心内有太多不安全感。现在，个人的与群体的，你们形成你们所知的物质实相。要改变你的世界,必须改变你的思想。在每一天的每一刻，你都必须有意识地觉知你对自己说的是实话，因为那就是你投射出去的实相。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Until you are honest with yourself and become consciously aware of yourself, you cannot honestly relate with others; you will project upon them your own fears and prejudices. You cannot afford to help them because you have too many insecurities within yourself. Now, you form the physical reality that you know, individually and en masse. To change your world you must change your thoughts. You must become consciously aware of what you tell yourself is true every moment of the day, for that is the reality that you project outward.</details>
(Bert C.：“听起来光是完成那件事的头一半就像是一辈子的任务了，在你能开始与他人建立关系之前。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Bert C.: “It sounds like a life-long task just to work out the first half of that, before you can begin to relate to others.”)</details>
的确是的。不过，心电感应真的存在。那么，别人对你的所思所感大部分也都有所知觉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is, indeed. However, telepathy does exist. Others are aware, then, to a large extent of what you are thinking and feeling.</details>
(Bert C.：“知道我真正的感受而不管我可能有意识地投射出什么？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Bert C.: “My true feelings, despite what I might project consciously?”)</details>
真正的感受并不一定暗示暴力或攻击性的感觉。它们也暗示埋藏在你自己的恐惧之下爱与接受的感觉，和那些你不敢在物质实相中表达的感觉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The true feelings do not necessarily imply the violent or aggressive feelings. They also imply the feelings of love and acceptance that are buried beneath your own fears, and those you are terrified of expressing in physical reality.</details>
(Bert C.：“那我想我了解了，即我意识的所有不同层面都在和人沟通——不只是被我有意识地表达出来，也还心电感应式地和人沟通。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Bert C.: “I think I understand then, that all of these different levels of my consciousness are being communicated ---- not only by me consciously, but also telepathically.”)</details>
的确如此。当你向外投射你的意念时，你常表现出好像它们不是你的，却属于别人的样子。因此你理应了解你的意念和感受是什么，而不被它们惊吓。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>That is true. When you project your ideas outward, you often behave as if they were not yours but belonged to another. Therefore it behooves you to understand what your ideas and feelings are, and not to be frightened of them.</details>

你的确可以改变它们，但不要否定你自己想扭那人脖子的那部分。你这么害怕这想法以致你立刻把它抑制了。让我们来想想看，你怕“恶比善更有威力”这个概念，你也很怕你的一个偶然飘过的暴力念头，却比善的活力更重要而有力。至少你还觉察到那想法。假设发生了以下的事，即在你来说，你已进步到你不再觉察到那种感觉的地步——<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You can indeed change them, but do not deny the part of you that wanted to wring the other man’s neck. You were so frightened of the thought that you immediately inhibited it. Let us consider. You are terrified of the idea that evil is more powerful than good, that one stray violent thought of yours was more important and powerful than the vitality of good. At least you were aware of the thought. Now say the following happened, that in your terms you progressed to the point where you were no longer aware of the feeling ?</details>
(J.H：“我是不会自动想到这家伙有什么好的，我也不会压抑负面的想法而不觉察我所感受的。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jim H.: “You don’t just automatically think good things about this fellow, and repress the negative thoughts without becoming aware of what you felt.”)</details>
当然，因而你的肌肉紧张起来，肾上腺素的产量也增加了。你想扭他的脖子，但你说：“我的好小子，上帝保佑你。希望你快乐又长寿。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Of course, so your muscles tensed, your adrenalin production increased. You wanted to wring his neck but you said, “God bless you, my fine young fellow. May you live a long and merry life.”</details>
心电感应地，我们的好小子完全清楚你的感觉，你却与你的感觉分了家。在你现在的灵性进度来说，你只是在想象你祝他好运。肌肉却已在你的身体里收缩起来，因为你不承认你真正的感觉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Telepathically, our fine young fellow knew exactly what you were feeling. You were out of contact with your feelings. At this point of your spiritual progression, you only imagined that you wished him good. The muscles were already contracted in your body because you did not admit your true feelings.</details>
假设三周之后我们又有另一次邂逅，我们可怜的无知工人又在他工作时睡着了。我们的好牧师经过，他看见那懒鬼躺在地板上小睡，他想：“我真想踢你，让你知道你在哪里。”但又想：“哦，不，我不能有这种违反基督徒精神的想法。暴力是错的。”因此甚至在他对自己承认他的感觉之前，他已隐藏起了任何对自己攻击性的承认，而弯下腰说：“我的好汉，希望你长寿而快乐。上帝祝福你的人生。”他沾沾自喜的想着：“我一天天地更有灵性了。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now three weeks later we have another encounter. Our poor ignorant workman again falls asleep at his chores. Our good minister comes by. He sees the idle one upon the floor snoozing, and he thinks, “I would like to kick you in the you-know-where.” But then, “Oh no, I cannot think such an unchristian thought. Violence is wrong.” So before he even admits to himself what he feels, hiding any acknowledgement of aggression, he bends down and says, “My good man, may you live long and heartily. God bless your life.” He pats himself upon the back and thinks, “I am growing more spiritual day by day.”</details>
同时，他的肌肉收缩了十倍，因为在它们背后的思绪被否定了，肌肉乃不可能有活动的机会。我们可怜的工人再次潜意识地觉察这个企图，但只到某个程度而已。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In the meantime, his muscles have contracted ten times because they could not be put into activity, as the thought behind them was denied. Our poor man is again subconsciously aware of the intent, but only to some degree.</details>
三个月之后，你经历了一个真正倒霉的日子。你对什么事都看不顺眼，而现在你发现我们的朋友又在地上躺着；也许这次他在你要他完成的一个比较重要的工作上睡着了。(幽默地：)即使是在一个幻想中，我也不敢指控你做了这样一件举动，但这次你真的是疯了。再次的，为了要有灵性——那并不是真的有灵性——你理应否认你的真感受，而再次说：“上帝保佑你，你平安地去吧。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Three months later you have had a really bad day. You are mad at life in general, and now you find our friend upon the floor again; this time, perhaps, he is asleep at a somewhat more important chore that you wanted done. (Humorously): Now far be it from me to accuse you of such an act, even in a fantasy, but this time you are out of your mind. Again, it behooves you to deny your true feelings in order to be spiritual ---- which is not true spirituality ---- and you say again, “God bless you, may you go in peace.”</details>
这次，那心灵的安全活瓣受不了了。现在最好的是你突然冒起火来踢他一脚。最坏的则是你又一次抑制了对那郁积的、完全自然的、现已准备要爆炸的攻击性的承认——因而你放出了一个与所有曾发生事件完全不成比例的“心念形相”。这“心念形相”给你的朋友带来严重的伤害；而所有这些，全是因为你害怕自己一次偶然的攻击性思想，比住在你们每个人之内的生命力还要更有威力。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This time the psychic safety valve has had too much. The nicest thing that could happen would be that you suddenly blew your stack and kicked him. The worst thing that could happen would be that once again you restrain the acknowledgement of the pent up, perfectly natural aggression that is now ready to explode ---- so you send out a thought form out of all proportion to any of the events that have transpired. The thought form causes your friend severe harm; and all of this because you were afraid that one stray aggressive thought of yours was more powerful than the vitality that resides in each of you.</details>
(Jim H.：“在一开始，在我们还没加重挫败感与附带的情绪负荷时，你会不会建议我们采取一个行动？好比这样跟他说：‘喂，快醒醒，这样是不对的。虽然我自己可能也做过这种事，但这真的让我不高兴。我们必须起来动手做事了。’在那个层面上，对他说实话会不会阻止了这些精神负荷呢？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jim H.: “In the beginning, before we compounded the frustration and the emotional charges, would you have recommended an action like saying, ‘Come on, this is wrong. I’ve probably done this sort of thing myself, but it really bugs me. We have to get up and get to work here.’ Would being honest with him at that level have prevented these charges?”)</details>
会的。不过，最重要的事是承认这种感受为合法的，有它自己的存在领域，承认它是你自己的一部分，然后选择你想怎么对付它的方式。你不能把别人当作你的出气筒；生气只是一种沟通方法。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Yes. The most important thing, however, is to acknowledge the feeling as legitimate, with its own realm of existence, to admit it as a part of yourself. Then choose how you want to deal with it. You do not make others the brunt of your anger; anger is merely a method of communication.</details>
(Jim H.：“我不想把我的愤怒针对着他或我。一来，我不想踢他。二来，我也不想在某些方面伤到我自己。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jim H.: “I don’t want to direct the brunt of my anger at either of us. One, I don’t want to kick him. Two, I don’t want to hurt myself in some way.”)</details>
最开始你并没有气到要踢他。这个念头存在，但还没强烈到会带来身体反应的地步，即使你已完全地承认了。你懂吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Originally you were not angry enough to kick him. The thought existed, but it wasn’t strong enough to bring about the physical reaction even if you had fully admitted it. Do you follow me?</details>
(Jim H.：“懂。我想学会如何处理这种感情，而不去试图压抑它们。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jim H.: “Yes. I want to learn how to handle such feelings, without trying to repress them.”)</details>
首先你应该承认这感受存在为你自己的一部分，在自我的层面。不论何时,当你把你的感受对你自己关闭掉的时候，在你来说，你的活力就减少了。那么，尽你所能的，以你选择的不论什么方式用语言沟通这些感受吧。利用愤怒作为沟通的一种方法，往往它会导向你没想到的结果，而且是有利的结果。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You should first of all admit that the feelings exist as a part of yourself, at the ego level. Whenever you close your feelings off from yourself you are, in your terms, less alive. Then, as far as is possible, communicate those feelings verbally in whatever way you choose. Use anger as a method of communication. Often it will lead to results that you do not think of, and beneficial ones.</details>
你必然了解,我对你的例子作了我对别的例子同样的处理，所以请不要被触怒。你明白，我不要你们任何一个人把这概念用作抚慰你“滴血的心”的表面化绷带……因此你不如我故意说的那么坏。你也许有所指出的那种倾向，但在场的每个人也都如此，包括鲁柏在内。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You certainly understand that I am doing with your case the same thing that I have done with others, so please do not be offended. I do not want any of you, you see, to use these ideas as superficial bandages for your bleeding psyches…. So you are not as bad as I pegged you. You might be inclined in the direction I have indicated, but then so is everyone else in the room, including Ruburt.</details>
(Jim H.“在那情况里你如何对‘坏’下定义？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jim H.: “Now would you define bad in that context?”)</details>
我不对“坏”下定义。当我用那个字时是照你们自己的定义。你们有个想法：“好”是温和的，而“坏”是暴烈的。这是因为在你心中，暴力与破坏是同一回事。用这个比喻的话，那么柔和的声音便是神圣的，大的声音便是恶毒的；一个强烈的欲望就是坏的欲望，一个淡淡的欲望就是个好的欲望。你变得害怕把想法或欲望投射出去，因为在你心底，你认为有威力的东西就是邪恶的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I do not define bad. When I use the term it is according to your own definition. You have an idea that good is gentle and bad is violent. This is because in your mind violence and destruction are the same thing. By this analogy, you see, the soft voice is the holy voice and the loud voice is the wicked one, and a strong desire is the bad desire and a weak desire the good one. You become afraid of projecting ideas or desires outward, for in the back of your mind you think that what is powerful is evil.</details>
反之，我要告诉你，这宇宙是个好宇宙。它知道自己的活力，而那活力也在你之内，你可以自由地鼓励它。你自己的天性是个好天性，你能信赖它。只因某事很难并不表示它是好的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Instead, I am telling you that the universe is a good universe. It knows its own vitality, and that vitality is within you. You can encourage it freely. Your own nature is a good nature and you can trust it. Because something is difficult does not mean it is good.</details>
(Jim H.：“我在这儿的第一晚，你说：‘我们还会常常见到你。’好像颇为肯定的样子。我常常奇怪你为何这样确定？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jim H.: “The first night I was here you said, ‘We will see more of you.’ You were quite definitive about it. I’ve often wondered, why the certainty?”)</details>
因为我知道你为何到这儿来，而且我知道你的太太也会来。我并不是说没有自由意志的存在。我只是对这个可能性的领域作了一个简单声明而已。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Because I knew why you had come here, and I knew your wife would come also. I am not saying there is no free will. I am simply making a statement about this realm of Probabilities.</details>
(J.H.：“对我而言，那暗示了一个对我们生活的预知。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jim H.: “To me that implies a prior knowledge of our lives.”)</details>
在你们来说的确如此，但那种知识你们也能得到。我不在单单一个晚上连一个题目也无法清楚地讨论完，更别说一百零一个题目了。不过，关于你早先所作的一个短评：你在几乎你所有的生生世世里，都曾很强烈地卷入你所谓宗教性的努力里。而你其余的前世也一样以宗教性的热诚卷入相反的努力里，以你们的话来说，但我们稍后再谈那个。神圣的灵魂翻了个面成了耽于肉欲的，让我们这样说。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It does indeed, in your terms, but that knowledge is also available to you. Now we cannot cover one topic clearly in a single evening, much less one hundred and one topics. In reference, however, to one remark you made earlier: You have in almost all of your lives been strongly involved in what you would call religious endeavors. Your remaining lives were just as religiously involved in opposite endeavors, in your terms, but we will go into that later. The holy soul turned inside out is some fleshpot, let’s put it that way.</details>
你总是卷入有关“善”与“恶”的问题，你在埃及的两个文明里活过两次。在其中之一，你在这儿的朋友(Bert C.)也在内。今晚要详谈那一生是太晚了，此外，你俩都还未到能由它获益的时候。那也不是个只为叫你听得愉快的迷人故事，而是当你们能了解它时，会对你有帮助的故事。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You have always been involved with questions concerning good and evil, and you had two existences in two civilizations in Egypt. In one of these your friend over here (Bert C.) was involved. It is too late to go into that incarnation this evening and besides neither of you are ready to benefit from it yet. It is not a fascinating story to be told only for your enjoyment, but it will help when you can understand it.</details>
我反而更关心你们大家对今晚鲁柏所念的资料(谈诺斯提主义)的反应。至于说如果在你们看起来好像是一个学员在独占一节课的话，那就记住我以前说过的：一个人所说出的问题即许多人未说出的问题。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am much more concerned with the reaction of all of you to the material that Ruburt read this evening (on Gnosticism). Now if it seems to you that one class member is monopolizing a session, then remember what I have said before: The questions spoken by one are the unspoken questions of many.</details>
对你们许多人来说，好像你们一生下来就已沾染了罪恶。(对Jim H.：)在你有一次前世里，你不但衷心相信这点，并且还以此教人。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It has seemed to many of you that you have been tinged by evil, from birth. (To Jim H.): In one of your past lives you not only heartily believed this, but taught it.</details>
如鲁柏会这样说的，你在这儿的“贱内”(Jim的太太Jean)在那一生完全不赞同你的想法。不过，在那时她是个男人，而你是个女人，一个女祭司。你的朋友也是(Bert C.)。在那生，做为一个男人，Jean对你的人格有一种扩展的影响，但你非常偏爱仪式和对法术的信仰，也执着于存在本身即为邪恶与错误的概念。你的确是现在被称为诺斯提教派的一员。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>As Ruburt would put it, your sidekick over here (Jim’s wife, Jean) did not go along with your ideas at all in that life. She was a male at that time, however, and you were a female and a priestess. So was your friend (Bert C.). As a male in that life she had an expanding effect upon your personality, but you were very given to ritual and a belief in magic acts, and to the idea that existence in itself was evil and wrong. You were indeed a member of the sect now called Gnostic.</details>
(诺斯提主义是一种精选的宗教与哲学系统，统合柏拉图主义、东方学、基督教义与二元论的特色。它包括了基督教以前的时期与后来，而采取了好几种形式。但在所有的派别里，它的中心教条都是说：知识——灵知(gnosis)——¬¬才是由物质的桎梏获得解脱的方法，更胜于哲学或信仰。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Gnosticism was a selected system of religion and philosophy, uniting features of Platonism, orientalism, Christianity, and dualism. It embraced pre-Christian times and later, and took several forms. In all of them its central doctrine held that knowledge ---- gnosis ---- was the means of salvation from the tyranny of matter, more than philosophy or faith.</details>
(Jim H.：“我现在如此强烈地反对诺斯提主义就是为那原因吗？因为我已越过了那一点？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jim H.: “Is that why I react so strongly against Gnosticism now, because I’ve gone beyond that point?”)</details>
还不止此，却也因为你在自己内心感觉到对那信仰仍有一些同情。你一面在放你自己自由，也一面认出在你心灵内还有一个偏向那方的倾向，因此不论何时,你听到这种概念就大肆挞伐攻击，没悟到你却是在猛攻你自己。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Not only that, but because you sense in yourself still some sympathy toward the beliefs. While you are freeing yourself you recognize within your psyche a leaning in that direction, and so you lash out whenever you hear such ideas, not realizing that you lash out against yourself.</details>
(Kathy B.：“我对这诺斯提的文献有相似反应，是否也是这个原因？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Kathy B.: “Is that why I have a similar reaction to this Gnostic literature?”)</details>
你在那时是个男人，而且是他的一个朋友。其实几乎所有到这班上来的人，在某一个时候都从事过这种努力。你们全曾在其他班级同过班，虽然不一定是同我在一起。因为你们长久以来的兴趣，某些观点将对你们许多人造成很强烈的震撼。联想不仅在一世中运作，而且在你们来说，也在两世之间运作。现在说出的字和辞将启动了你们的记忆，如果你们允许它的话，那些记忆会变得活起来的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You were at that time a male and a friend of his. Now almost all who come to these classes have at one time or another been engaged in such endeavors. You have all been a part of other classes, though not necessarily with me. Because of your long interest, certain aspects will hit many of you very strongly. Association operates not only within one life, but between lives in your terms. Words and phrases spoken now will trigger your memories, and those memories will become alive if you allow them to.</details>
(对Art O.：)即使坐在那边的我们的“非洲之神”也能忆起他的前世，只要他肯允许自己那样做。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(To Art O.): Even our African god over there can remember his past lives if he will only allow himself to do so.</details>

(对Mart M.：)不过，对我们这边的朋友，我有一个讯息，很简单的几句话。当你不知道做什么好时，放松，告诉自己你的其他部分的确知道；他们会接管。让你自己休息一下。提醒自己,现在的你在许多方面就是个非常成功的人。成功不必一定要牵涉到伟大的才智或崇高的地位或庞大的财富；它乃是与内在的正直有关。记住那一点。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(To Mary M.): I have one message for our friend over here, however, and it is quite simple. When you do not know what to do, relax and tell yourself that other portions of yourself do know; they will take over. Give yourself some rest.

Success does not necessarily involve great intellect or great position or great wealth; it has to do with inner integrity. Remember that.</details>

ESP班的课<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>ESP CLASS SESSION:</details>
1971年2月9日 星期二<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1971</details>
(这节课也包含了赛斯所给的，已摘录在第十九章第575节里非常有趣的资料，关于当他在对一群人说话时，他自己的知觉状态。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(This session also contained the very interesting material that Seth gave concerning his own perceptions while he is addressing a group of people; that data is quoted in the 575th session, in Chapter Nineteen.)</details>
现在我的确有些话要对这个人(Sue W.)和那个人(Jim H.)说，并且也多少是对你们所有的人说。你们并不需要为你们的存在辨护(justify)。好比说，你们并不需要用写作或传教来为你们自己辨护。存在就是它自己的最佳理由，根本不需要辩护。只有当你了悟此点，你才能开始去利用你的自由，否则你会太过卖力的去试。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now I do have something to say to this one (Sue W.), and that one (Jim H.), and to some extent to all of you. There is no need to justify your existence. You do not need to write or preach to justify yourselves, for instance. Being is its own justification. Only when you realize this can you begin to utilize your freedom. Otherwise you try too hard.</details>
这也适用于我们的朋友鲁柏。如果你变得过于坚决的想为你的存在辨护的话，那么你就将开始关闭你生命的一些区域。对你而言，只有那些代表安全的存在理由才有意义，而其他的区域将开始消失。你不必以任何方式辩护。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This also applies to our friend Ruburt. If you become too determined to justify your existence then you will begin to close out areas of your life. Only those areas that mean safe justification to you will have meaning, and the others will begin to disappear. You do not have to justify in any terms.</details>
如果你们每个人，每天花上十分钟，对你自己的实相开放自己，就不会再有“自我辨护”的问题，因为你将了悟你自己本体奇迹似的性质。我以前在班上说过：你永远也不会比现在更“死”，也不会更“活”。在生活里，你可以和你认为的任何死尸一样的死——甚至，对照之下，还要更死得透些。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now if you would each, for ten minutes a day, open yourselves to your own reality there would be no question of self-justification, for you would realize the miraculous nature of your own identity. I have said this before in class: You are as dead now, and as alive, as you will ever be. In life you can be as dead as you think any corpse is ---- even, by contrast, far deader.</details>
当我到这儿来说话的时候，我集中我的能量，但却不是朝着这房间，把它当作一个目的地，因为以你们的话来说，这房间对我并不存在。以你们的话来说，这房间甚至对你们也不存在。你们假装同意它存在；我们并不在时间或空间的任何地点相会。发生于此地的真正相会，和这个房间或你们以为自己是的人并不相干。你们知道你们幻觉出这房间，在这里，你们与当你们在心理时间(psychological time)里一样，都是在出神状态中。我只是要你们了悟，如果此生是个出神状态，那么你就可以把你意识的方向转去感知现在就存在的那些更大实相。你们能觉察你们自己更大的本体，就像我一样。你就坐在你自己的奇迹内，却还在要求一个奇迹。我要打开的就是你的“心眼”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>When I come here to speak I focus my energy, but not toward this room as a destination, for in your terms this room does not exist to me. In your terms, this room does not even exist to you. You pretend to agree that it does; we meet in no place of space or time. The true meetings that take place here have nothing to do with the room or the people that you think you are. You know that you hallucinate the room, that you are as much in trance here as you ever are when you are in psychological time. I simply want you to realize that if this life is a trance, then you can turn the direction of your consciousness to perceive greater realities that presently exist. You can be aware of your own greater identity, even as I am. You sit within the miracle of yourselves and ask for signs. It is your inner eyes I would open.</details>
如你们自己也知道的，你们只接受那些在此时适合你目的的建议、想法与成见。因此，你并不在你前世的任何一种神经病的掌握中，也没有来自此生的任何你不能克服的恐惧。我没说你必然会克服它们，但那却是在你能力之内的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>As you know yourselves, you only accept those suggestions, ideas and hang-ups that suit your purposes at this time. You are not, therefore, at the mercy of any neurosis from a past life, nor are there any fears from your present lives that you cannot conquer. I have not said that you will necessarily conquer them, but it is within your ability to do so.</details>
按照你的了解，你作自己的决定。你不可能被一个你不了解的恐惧，由实相的一个层面追逐到另一个层面。你在此生也不能被来自你早年或所谓前世的恐惧所威胁，除非你如此彻底相信恐惧的本质而允许自己被它征服。你的每一个人格都可以从实相奇迹似的库存中，自由的接受与发展那些你想要的经验与感情，而摒弃那些你不要的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The decision is your own according to your understanding. You cannot be hounded from one level of reality to another by a fear that you do not understand. You cannot be threatened in this life by fears from your early childhood, or by so-called past existences, unless you so thoroughly believe in the nature of fear that you allow yourselves to be conquered by it. Each of your personalities are free to accept and develop, from the miraculous banks of reality, those experiences and emotions that you want, and to reject those you do not want.</details>
让我给你们一个更具体的例子，你们每个人可以自己的方式去用它。假设一种最坏的情况，即你在此生有以下的背景：你很穷，你是个少数民族的一份子，你不是知识分子，你是个女人，你身体有一项严重的残障，你一点也不美。虽然你在一个所谓的前世中，为你自己设下这些挑战，并不表示你不能用所有的勇气与决心去解决这些问题，你设下它们是预期你会解决它们。你设下它们，并不是把它们像磨石般绑在你颈项上，而在事先希望你会淹死。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Let me give you a more concrete example that each of you can use in your own way. Suppose the worst, that in this life you have the following background: You are poor, you are of a minority race, you are not intellectual, you are a woman, you have a severe physical defect and you are no beauty. Now you set these challenges for yourself in a so-called past life. This does not mean that you cannot use all of your courage and resolution to solve these problems. You set them in the hope that you will solve them. You did not set them like millstones about your neck, hoping ahead of time that you would drown.</details>
你所需要做的只是觉悟到你自己的自由。你形成你所知的实相，不是奥秘性的、不是象征性的、也不是哲学性的那样做，也没有哪个超灵(oversoul)替你形成它——你也不能把那重任放在那儿。在过去，你们曾集体的及个人的，为了你个人实相的本质——那些你的确不喜欢的方面——而怪罪一位上帝或命运。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>All you have to do is realize your own freedom. You form the reality that you know, not esoterically, not symbolically, not philosophically. Some great oversoul doesn’t form it for you ---- you cannot put the burden there, either. You have in the past, collectively and individually, blamed a god or a fate for the nature of your personal realities ---- those aspects, indeed that you did not like.</details>
人格被赋予了最伟大的礼物；你得到的正就是你所想要的东西。你由“虚空”中创造了属于你自己所有的经验。如果你不喜欢你的经验，那就观照你内心而改变那经验。但也要明白你要为你的喜乐和胜利负责，而创造任何这些实相的能量是来自“内我”。你怎么样用它就看你个人的个性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The personality is given the greatest gift of all; you get exactly what you want to get. You create from nothing the experience that is your own. If you do not like your experience, then look within yourself and change it. But realize also that you are responsible for your joys and triumphs, and that the energy to create any of these realities comes from the inner self. What you do with it is up to the individual personality.</details>
(在休息时，班上的人讨论命运与宿命的问题。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(During break class members discussed fate and predestination.)</details>
哪天晚上我希望我们坐在这边的女士跟我谈谈宿命论。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Some evening I would like our lady over here to talk to me about predestination.</details>
(Bernise M.：“我希望你讲给我听。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Bernice M.: “I would like you to talk to me about it.”)</details>
你并非“已被编好程式的”。没有一件事是因为它必得发生而发生。你现在有的每一个想法都改变了实相。还不只是你所知的实相，而是所有的实相。没有一个你的行动会使一个将来的你必然以某个特定方式行动。有好些活动的“库藏”，你可从任何活动中汲取或选择不汲取。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You are not “programmed.” Nothing happens because it must happen. Every thought that you have now changes reality. Not only reality as you know it, but all reality. No act of yours predisposes a future self to act in a particular manner. There are banks of activity from which you can draw or choose not to draw.</details>
(B.M.：“我们是否作‘即刻的’决定？好比说，我今天在想洛杉机地震的事。一个人走出去在街上被一块落下的砖块打死了。整栋楼里就这一个人走出来，这是什么造成的？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Bernice M.: “Do we make instantaneous decisions? For example, I was thinking of the Los Angeles earthquake today. A man walked out into the street and was killed by a falling brick. What made this one person in the entire building walk out?”)</details>
这个特定的人在一个你们会称为“无意识的基础”上，对将发生的事是相当清楚的，他并不是注定要死。在你们来说，他为了自己的理由，选择了死的“时间”与“方法”两者。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This particular individual was quite aware of what would occur, on what you would call an unconscious basis. He was not predestined to die. He chose both the time, in your terms, and the method, for reasons of his own.</details>
(B.M.：“不管是谁在选择，他命定了要死。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Bernice M.: “Regardless of who chose, it was destined that he die.”)</details>
不是命定的。是他选的。没人替他选择。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It was not predestined. He chose. No one chose for him.</details>
(B.M.：“但他在事前作了这个决定。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Bernice M.: “But he had made the decision before.”)</details>
在什么事以前？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Before when?</details>
(B.M.：“在他被杀死以前。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Bernice M.: “Before he was killed.”)</details>
他知道他已准备好到其他的活动层面去了。他无意识地四处寻找方法而选择那些马上就可以用的。这个特定的人，三天前已做好了计划。并没有涉及“宿命”。只因一枝树枝掉下来，并不表示它命定要以那特定的“方式”或“时机”掉下来。在“自由选择”与“宿命”之间有很大的不同。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>He knew that he was ready to go on to other spheres of activity. Unconsciously, he looked about for the means and chose those immediately available. This particular individual, three days earlier, had made the plan. There was no predestination involved. Because a tree branch falls, this does not mean that it was destined to fall in either the particular manner of its fall nor in the timing of the fall. There is a great difference between free choice and predestination.</details>
(Jim H.：“提到那生为少数民族的女人时，你先前不是说，在我们来说，这儿由一个先前的人格设下了挑战。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jim H.: “Didn’t you say earlier, referring to the woman who was born in a minority race, that her challenges had been set up by a previous personality, in our terms?”)</details>

再次的，你们必须了悟，我们为方便之故才说到“区分”，其实没有“区分”存在。可以说，在同“时”，这个人转世入一少数民族，而在一完全不同的时代，这人也许生下来就富有、安全而贵族化。它正在找出经验与扩展的不同方法。你懂吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You must realize, again, that we are speaking of divisions for convenience’s sake, where none really exists. At the same “time,” so to speak, that this personality is born into a minority race, in a completely different era it may be born rich, secure and aristocratic. It is searching out different methods of experience and expansion. Do you follow me?</details>

的确。要记住，我们在谈的是你“整个的本体”。那个目前只觉察它的一部分的只是你自己；而你又坚称这一部分为“你自己”。你即那个作这些决定的自己。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Indeed. Remember, this is your entire identity of which we are speaking. It is only you who are presently aware of but one portion of it; and this portion you insist upon calling yourself. You are the self who makes these decisions.</details>

可是，“内我”了悟有些潜能在那儿，那是在其他环境之下不一定会在的——那些才能不只能帮助现在这人格，还能帮助其他的人，甚至一般的社会。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The inner self realizes, however, that potentials are present that would not necessarily be present under other circumstances ---- abilities that can not only help the present personality but other individuals, and even society at large.</details>
你们争论的重点是被情绪上的障碍带来的，而那是由用语的不同而引起的。就好像你选择了在贫民窟工作？一天，如果你选择这样做而后对你自己说：“我为什么要选择在贫民窟工作？我情愿在第五街工作。”就会很可笑。你明白你选择的理由，你整个的本体明白那个理由。你瞒住目前的自己，以保证这目前的实相不是个假装的实相。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Your main point of contention is brought about by the emotional barriers that are caused by the difference in terms. It is as if you choose to work for a day in the slums. It would be ridiculous for you to choose to do this, and then say to yourself, “Why did I choose to work in the slums? I would prefer to work on Fifth Avenue.” You know the reason, and your entire identity knows the reason. You hide it from the present self simply to insure the fact that the present reality is not a pretended one.</details>
一个试着穷上一天以学习贫穷是怎么回事的有钱人学不到多少，因为他无法忘怀他可以使用的财富。虽然这一天——或一年或五年——他与穷人吃得同样糟、住得同样破，他知道他有他的大厦可回。因此你瞒住自己这些事，以便你能与当前的境况建立关系。你忘记你的“家”，以便能带着丰富的经验回到它那里去。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>A rich man who tries to be poor for a day to learn what poverty is learns little, because he cannot forget the wealth that is available to him. Though he eats the same poor fare as the poor man, and lives in the same poor house for a day ---- or for a year or five years ---- he knows he has his mansion to return to. So you hide these things from yourself so that you can relate. You forget your home so that you can return to it enriched.</details>
“意识”不常由“平衡”造成，反而是由精妙的“不平衡”造成，而在某程度，觉察所以能集中，正是这种不平衡所引起的兴奋状态的结果。在这种状态永远不可能知道所有的元素，因为新的元素永远在被创造出来。我说的并不是物质元素，而是“意识的心理特性”，因为即使是那些特性也是在继续出现与改变。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Consciousness is not made up of balances so much as it is made up of exquisite imbalances, and the focus of awareness is to some degree the result of this state of excitability. In this state all elements are never known because new ones are always being created. I am not speaking of physical elements, but of the psychological characteristics of consciousness, for even those continually merge and change.</details>
你现在就不是十分钟之前的你。无论是生理上、心理上、精神上或心灵上，你都不是同一个存在，而十分钟后你又会不同了。如果否认这点，就是试图把意识强挤入它永远脱身不得的某个僵固形式，也就是对意识运用规则，来造就一个非常整齐的心理景观。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You are not now what you were ten minutes earlier. You are not the same being physically, psychologically, spiritually, or psychically, and ten minutes later you will be different again. To deny this is to try to force consciousness into some rigid form from which it cannot ever be freed, to apply rules to it that make a very neat psychological landscape.</details>

现在我希望你们再次了悟你们可得到的能量。如果鲁柏能用，你们每个人也都可以你们自己的方式来用它。我要你们打开在自己心灵内所树立的障碍；这声音只用来作一个象征，代表了当你们利用那些天赋的能力时，你们每个人都可得的能量与力量。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now I would like you again to realize the energy that is available. If Rubert can use it, you can each use it in your own way. I want you to open up those barriers that you have erected within yourselves; this voice is only used as a symbol of the energy and the strength that is available to each of you, as you utilize those abilities that are your heritage.</details>
你们应该听到你们自己对我声音的回音，那是你们自己能量与喜悦的一个象征。忘掉你那个偶尔会畏缩的自己，相反的，记着你自己这存在的神奇本质，它即使在当下这一刻也正经由你的指尖唱歌。那才是你们在寻找的实相。充分的体验它吧！你们需要像我这样的一个死老头来告诉你们生命是什么吗？我真该替你们惭愧呢！<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You should hear your own echo of my voice as a symbol of your own energy and joy. Forget the cringing selves that you sometimes are and remember, instead, the magic essence of your own being that sings even now through your fingertips. That is the reality which you are seeking. Experience it fully. Do you need an old dead thing like me to tell you what life is? I should be ashamed.</details>
现在，我祝你们晚安，我给你们一切我能给的祝福。祝你们在体内和体外旅游时，都很宁静、喜乐且平安！<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now, I bid you a fond good evening, and those blessings that are mine to give, I give you. Travel in peace and joy and safety, in your bodies and out.</details>
