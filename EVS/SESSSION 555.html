(自9月30日以来，赛斯曾上了两堂ESP班的课；为我们的朋友约翰·巴克雷——他将迁往内华达州——上了一课；为珍和我上了两课，谈有关我们因这资料而在从事的工作；并且又一次在电视上透过珍讲话——这次是在我们重访华盛顿特区的一家电视台时。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Since September 30 Seth has held two ESP class sessions; held a session for our friend John Barclay, who is moving to Nevada; held two sessions concerning the work Jane and I are embarking upon because of this material; and spoken through Jane upon television once more ---- this time during our return visit to a Washington, D.C. station.</details>
(这个月初珍和我买了一本文选，包括了死于1961年的瑞士精神分析家卡尔·荣格(Carl Jung)写的一长段。当珍还没看完这一部分之前，赛斯就在10月19日第554节中建议珍把那书搁在一边：“暂时放下荣格。”但他并没有详加说明。无论如何这并非珍首次接触荣格的著作。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Early this month Jane and I bought an anthology containing a long section by Carl Jung, the Swiss psychoanalyst who died in 1961. Jane hadn’t finished reading this part of the book when Seth suggested, in the 554th session for October 19, that she lay the book aside: “Let Jung go for now.” He did not elaborate. This wasn’t Jane’s first contact with the writings of Jung by any means.</details>
(留意赛斯如何从像荣格这样的资料“起飞”的方式是很有趣的事，他把它演绎开来，而将他自己的概念与诠释包括进去，如他在本章中所做的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(It’s interesting to note, however, the way in which Seth “takes off” from material like Jung’s, developing it to include his own ideas and interpretations, as he does in this chapter.</details>
(下了一整天的雨。珍今天去看了整脊师，感到非常的放松——如此放松以致我必须问她想不想上课。她说她想要。她两眼半睁，当课开始时，她的声音非常温和，几乎是聊天的口气。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(It had been raining all day. Jane had been to the chiropractor today and was very relaxed ---- so relaxed that I asked her if she felt like having a session. She wanted to, she said. Her eyes were half open, her voice very quiet, almost conversational, as the session began.)</details>
晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Good evening.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
现在，我们开始口述。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: We will begin dictation.</details>
(我想获知赛斯对珍的身体状态的反应：“你觉得怎么样”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(I thought I would get Seth’s reaction to Jane’s physical state. “How do you feel?”)</details>
我觉得很好。不过有一点我要告诉我们的朋友：他最好别在下雨天去看“整脊师”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I feel fine. One point to our friend. It is better if he does not go to the chiropractor when it is raining.</details>
(“为什么呢？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Why is that?”)</details>
部分是因为那整脊师提到的肌肉反应，部分是因为在晴天身体的疗病机制运作得更有效些，在治疗后他会更快地复原。无论如何有一点好处：他这回按照医嘱休息了(整整一小时)；因为他觉得有此必要。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Partially because of the muscular reaction mentioned by the chiropractor, and partially because the body’s healing mechanisms operate more effectively in clear weather. He will snap back more quickly after a treatment. There is one good benefit however: He rested the full amount specified (one hour) this time because he felt it necessary.</details>
(“你是否宁愿放弃今晚的课？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Would you rather pass up the session tonight?”)</details>
我们上课没问题。不过为此今晚将是一堂短课，却是很好的一课。可是我想要对刚才那些声明详加解释。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We are fine for a session. It will be a short one considering, but a good one. I would like to elaborate, however, on these statements.</details>
当然这样的一次治疗，引起了对组成脊椎的原子结构(atomic structure)的操纵。电性反应会因气候与大气的情况而有所不同。在雨天，原子结构本身之内有更多的电阻像是一种延迟反应，在身体来说几乎不能察觉——可是在脊椎再平复到应该在的位置前会拖延一段时间。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Such a (chiropractic) treatment causes, of course, a manipulation of the atomic structure that composes the vertebrae. The electrical reactions are different according to the weather and atmospheric conditions. In rainy weather, there is an added electrical resistance within the atomic structures themselves ---- a sort of delayed reaction, hardly perceptible in physical terms ---- a delayed period before the vertebrae come to rest again, so to speak, in the desired position.</details>
在它们进入应在位置的同时，还是有持续的活动。在晴朗的天气，“反应延迟”的现象少得多，而受到刺激、扰动的原子能更快地平复下来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>While they take the desired position, there is still continued activity. In clear weather there is much less of a delayed reaction, and the activated, stirred-up atoms come more quickly to rest.</details>
现在：我们的下一章要叫作〈转世、梦以及隐于自身之内的男性与女性〉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Our next chapter will be called: “Reincarnation, Dreams, and the Hidden Male and Female Within the Self.”</details>
(到现在珍的步调加快了很多。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(By now Jane’s pace had quickened a good deal.)</details>
如我先前提过的，每一个人都经历过男性与女性的生活。照例，对这些，你们并没留下有意识的记忆。为了防止一个人与他现在的性别过分认同，在男人内住着一个内在的女性化身(aninner personification of femaleness)。这在男性内的女性化身，就是荣格所谓的“女灵”(anima)的真义。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>As I mentioned earlier, each person lives both male and female lives. As a rule, conscious memory of these is not retained. To prevent an overidentification of the individual with his present sex, within the male there resides an inner personification of femaleness. This personification of femaleness in the male is the true meaning of what Jung called the “anima.”</details>
因此，在男性内的“女灵”，是“内我”曾涉及所有先前的“女性生活”在心灵上的记忆与认同。在这“女灵”内包含了对现在这位男性过去女性历史的知识，以及对此人天生禀赋的所有女性特质的一种直觉了解。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The anima in the male is, therefore, the psychic memory and identification of all the previous female existences in which the inner self has been involved. It contains within it the knowledge of the present male’s past female histories, and the intuitive understanding of all the female qualities with which the personality is innately endowed.</details>
因此，这“女灵”是一个重要的保障，阻止这男人过分认同于经由目前背景、环境和教育而强加于他的文化上的男性特质。这女灵不但会影响个人，也影响到群体文明，柔化强烈的攻击倾向，并且在家庭关系中作了与女人沟通的桥梁，当它透过艺术和语言而应用在传播和沟通方面时，它也是桥梁。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The anima, therefore, is an important safeguard, preventing the male from over-identifying with whatever cultural male characteristics have been imposed upon him through present background, environment, and education. The anima serves not only as a personal but as a mass-civilizing influence, mellowing strongly aggressive tendencies and serving also as a bridge both in communicating with women in a family relationship, and in communication also as it is applied through the arts and verbalization.</details>
因此，男人常梦到自己是女人。他作这种梦的特别方式，能告诉他许多关于他生为女人时的转世背景。男性与女性显然不是相反的，而是相合的倾向。女祭司、母亲、年轻的女巫、妻子以及有智慧的老妇——这些一般型乃是原型(archetypes)。只因它们是“根元素”(root elements)，象征性地代表各种不同的所谓女性特质，以及男人所曾经历过的各种不同女性人生。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The male will often dream of himself, therefore, as a female. The particular way in which he does so, can tell him much about his own reincarnational background in which he operated as a female. Maleness and femaleness are obviously not opposites, but merging tendencies. The priestess, the mother, the young witch, the wife, and the old wise woman ---- these general types are archetypes, simply because they are “root elements” representing, symbolically, the various kinds of so-called female qualities and the various kinds of female lives that have been lived by males.</details>
当然，它们也被女人经历过。然而，女人们不需被提醒她们的女性特质，但同样的，为了使她们不致与她们目前的性别过分认同，在女人内有荣格所谓的“男灵”(animus)或隐藏的男性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They have also been lived by females, of course. However, the women do not need to be reminded of their femaleness, but again, so that they do not overidentify with their present sex, there is what Jung called the “animus,” or the hidden male within the woman.</details>
同样的，这又代表了自己所曾涉及的男性生活——少年、祭司、富攻击性的“丛林男人”，以及有智慧的老男人。这些类型一般性及象征性地代表了目前这女人过去所活过的男性生活。因此，透过研究在其中出现了这些类型的那些梦，或在其中她们自己以男性姿态出现的梦，女人可以对她们前世做男人的生活学到很多。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Again, however, this represents the male lives with which the self has been involved ---- the young boy, the priest, the aggressive “jungle man,” and the wise old man. These are types, representing generally and symbolically past male lives lived by present women. Women, therefore, can learn much about their reincarnational past as men, through studying those dreams in which these types appear, or in which they themselves appear as men.</details>
经由所谓的女灵与男灵，目前的人格便能汲取前世作为另一性别的存在所获得的知识、直觉与背景。举例来说，在某些情形，这女人可能做得过分而夸大了女性特征。在那种例子里，男灵或她内的男性便来帮她的忙，由梦境带给她一大堆的知识冲击，而结果带来补偿性的像男人样的反应。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Through the anima and the animus, so-called, present personalities are able to draw upon the knowledge and intuitions and background that was derived from past existences as the opposite sex. On some occasions, for example, the woman may go overboard and exaggerate female characteristics, in which case the animus or male within comes to her aid, bringing through dream experiences an onrush of knowledge that will result in compensating malelike reactions.</details>
当男人不论为何理由而过分认同于他所认为的男性特征时，也会有同样的情形。女灵或内在的女人会促使他作补偿性的行动，引起一大股直觉的能力，带来创造性的成分以抵销攻击性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The same applies to a male when he over-identifies with what he believes to be male characteristics, for whatever reason. The anima or woman within will rouse him to make compensating actions, causing an upsurge of intuitive abilities, bringing a creative element to offset aggressiveness.</details>
理想地说，不加干扰的话，这些运作的结果应该是一个平衡的个人与群体，永远创造性地利用攻击性，就像它的确可能是并且应该是的样子。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Ideally, left alone, these operations would result in a balance individually and en masse, where aggressiveness was always used creatively, as indeed it can and should be.</details>
你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break.</details>
(10:02。“很好。”在珍脱离出神状态时我对她说。她说：“是啊，我能感觉到它是很棒，因为他还有许多要说的。”但她看来如此无力，眼皮沉重，如此眼神朦胧却放松，以致我怀疑她是否可能保持清醒继续下去。在10:21以同样方式继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:02. “Very good,” I said to Jane as she came out of trance. “Yes,” she said, “I could tell it was great, ‘cause he’s got a lot more to say.” Yet she looked so limp and heavy-eyed, so bleary and yet relaxed, that I wondered if she could stay awake to continue. Resume in the same manner at 10:21.)</details>
现在：男灵与女灵自然在心灵上是高度充电的，但这心灵电荷的源起与内在的着迷，则是与这些拟人化异性特征十分合理的内在认同的结果。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: The animus and the anima are, of course, highly charged psychically, but the origin of this psychic charge and the inner fascination are the result of a quite legitimate inner identification with these personified other-sex characteristics.</details>
(步调较慢。)可是，它们不只在心灵内有一个真实的存在，它们还被“内我”以遗传式的密码资料深记在心——对过去心灵事件的遗传性记忆——转移到组成身体的那些细胞的遗传性记忆里。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pace slower.) They not only have a reality in the psyche, however, but they are imbedded in genetically codified data by the inner self ---- a genetic memory of past psychic events ---- transposed into the genetic memory of the very cells that compose the body.</details>
每个“内我”采用一个新身体的时候，便将它所曾涉及过的以往身体记忆强加于新的身体上，强加于它整个的遗传构成(genetic make-up)上。不过现今的特性通常掩蔽了过去的。它们是主宰性的，但其他的特性是隐性并且存在的，天生就在模式之内的。因此，现在身体的肉体模式具有自己过去肉体在遗传上的记忆，并且包含了其优点与缺点。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Each inner self, adopting a new body, imposes upon it and upon its entire genetic makeup, memory of the past physical forms in which it has been involved. Now the present characteristics usually overshadow the past ones. They are dominant, but the other characteristics are latent and present, built into the pattern. The physical pattern of the present body, therefore, is a genetic memory of the self’s past physical forms, and of their strengths and weaknesses.</details>
(10:29。珍揉揉眼睛；她说得很慢，常常中断。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:29. Jane rubbed her eyes; she was speaking slowly, with many pauses.)</details>
我将尽量予以简化。在身体内现在有许多看不见的层次。你可见的最上一层当然是代表目前的肉体形相。但陷在其内还有些可以说是看不见的层次、“阴影”、隐性的层面，代表了曾属于此人的先前肉体形相。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I will try to put this as simply as possible. There are presently invisible layers within the body, the topmost layer that you see representing, of course, the present physical form. But enmeshed within this there are what amount to invisible layers, “shadow,” latent layers that represent previous physical images that have belonged to the personality.</details>
可以说，它们被暂时搁置着。它们与现在身体的原子结构有电磁性的联系。按你们的思想方式来看，它们会是没对好焦点而不明确的。可是，他们是你们心灵遗产的一部分。你常可唤起先前身体的一个过去的长处，来帮助你弥补目前的弱点。因此，身体不只生物性地带着它自己这一生过去情况的记忆，而且那些在先前的转世中，此人所形成的其他身体记忆，也不可抹煞的与它实质在一起。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They are kept in abeyance, so to speak. They are connected electromagnetically to the atomic structure of the present body. To your way of thinking, they would be unfocused. They are a part of your psychic heritage, however. Often you can call up a past strength of a previous body, to help compensate for a present weakness. The body does not only carry memory biologically of its own past condition in this life therefore, but indelibly with it, even physically, are the memories of the other bodies that the personality has formed in previous reincarnations.</details>
女灵与男灵和这些内在的身体意象密切相连。这些身体意象在心灵上是高度带电的，同时也在梦境出现。它们为了阻止你与现在的身体过分认同，而有补偿和提醒的作用。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The anima and the animus are closely connected with these interior body images. These body images are highly charged psychically, and also appear in the dream state. They operate as compensations and reminders to prevent you from over-identifying yourself with your present physical body.</details>
当然，它们是男性也是女性。当你生病时，在梦中你常会感觉自己仿佛是有完全健康身体的另一个人。这种梦常有治疗性，一个“老些的”转世身体来帮你的忙，而你经由对它的健康记忆而汲取力量。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They are, of course, both male and female. When you are ill, in the dream state you often have experiences in which you seem to be someone else with an entirely healthy body. Often such a dream is therapeutic. An “older” reincarnational body has come to your aid, from which you draw strength through the memory of its health.</details>
(10:44)我们要结束这一节，下次再继续我们的资料，除非你有问题。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:44.) We will end the session, continuing our material next time, unless you have questions.</details>
(“我没有问题。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“No.”)</details>
那么，给你俩我最衷心的祝福，并祝一个美好的晚上。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My heartiest regards to you both then, and a fond good evening.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。非常感谢你。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good evening, Seth. Thank you very much.”</details>
(10:45。一旦离开了出神状态，珍说她现在与课开始前觉得一样好，甚至更好。她对这突然的结束感到惊讶。在课中她感到“完全被动”，而在课进行时，我听到她的步调越来越慢。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:45. Once out of trance, Jane said she now felt as good or better than she had before the session began. She was surprised at the sudden ending. She had felt “really passive” during the session, and I had listened to her pace grow slower and slower as the session progressed.)</details>
