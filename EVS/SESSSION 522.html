<div style="display:inline">1970年4月8日 星期三 晚上9：13</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>APRIL 8, 1970, 9:13 P.M. WEDNESDAY</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在，晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now, good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们继续。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>We will continue.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">全盘来说，这些“时代剧”有其特定的目的。由于意识的天性使然，它总想在尽可能多的空间中具体化——从自己创造出新的知觉层次、新的分枝。在如此做时它创造了所有的实相。因此，实相永远是在一个变为的状态。例如，在你所演的角色里，你所想的思想仍然是完全独特的，并导致了新的创造性。你自己意识的某些面向无法以其他的方式完成。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>These “period pieces,” overall, have a particular purpose. By the very nature of consciousness, it seeks to materialize itself in as many dimensions as possible ---- to create from itself new levels of awareness, new offshoots. In doing so it creates all reality. Reality, therefore, is always in a state of becoming. The thoughts that you think, for example, in your actor’s roles, are still completely unique and lead to new creativity. Certain aspects of your own consciousness could be fulfilled in no other way.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">当你想到转世时，你假设有一系列的进展。其实，这种种不同的人生是由你的内我所生出的。它们不是被某个外在的媒介强加诸你的。它们是当你的意识开放而以尽可能多的方式表现它自己时的一个具体发展。意识不被限制在三度空间的一生里，它也不被限制于仅只有三度空间的存在。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>When you think of reincarnation, you suppose a series of progressions. Instead the various lives grow out of what your inner self is. They are not thrust upon you by some outside agency. They are a material development, as your consciousness opens up and expresses itself in as many ways as possible. It is not restricted to one three-dimensional lifetime, nor is it restricted to three-dimensional existence alone.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">于是你的意识采取了许多形态，而这些形态并不需要彼此相似，就如一条毛毛虫并不像一只蝴蝶一样。灵魂或存有具有完全的表达自由。它改变它的形态以适合它的表达，而它形成环境就像设好舞台布置，它形成世界来适合它的目的。每个布景又带来新的发展。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your consciousness then takes many forms, and these forms need not be alike any more, say, than a caterpillar is like a butterfly. The soul or entity has complete freedom of expression. It changes its form to suit its expression, and it forms environments like stage settings, and worlds to suit its purposes. Each setting brings forth new developments.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(珍停顿了许多回。)灵魂或存有是为个人化的精神能量。它形成了你所穿的任一个身体，并且是你的肉体存活(physical survival)背后的原动力，因为你由它得到你的活力。意识永远无法静止，而在寻求进一步的创造。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane was taking many more pauses.) The soul or entity is highly individualized spiritual energy. It forms whatever body you now wear, and is the motive power behind your physical survival, for from it you derive your vitality. Consciousness can never be still, but seeks further creativity.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:28。)因此，灵魂或存有将自己的属性赋予了三度空间实相和三度空间自身。在三次元自己里仍潜存着存有的能力。那个三次元自己，那个演员，能够通达这个资料与这些潜能。在学着应用这些潜能时，在学着重新发现它们与存有的关系时，三次元自己更提升了成就、理解与创造的层次。三次元自己变得超越了它所知的自己。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:28.) The soul, therefore, or entity, endows three-dimensional reality, and the three-dimensional self with its own properties. The abilities of the entity lie within the three-dimensional self. The three-dimensional self, the actor, has access to this information and to these potentials. In learning to use these potentials, in learning to rediscover its relationship with the entity, the three-dimensional self raises still further the level of achievement, comprehension, and creativity. The three-dimensional self becomes more than it knows.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不只是存有更强大了，而且它实现于三次元世界的那部分，现在也增益了那世界本身的特质与天性。没有这创造性，你们所谓的地球生命就会永远是荒瘠的。因而灵魂或存有将生命的气息赋予了身体及其内的三次元自己。三次元自己然后从事它自己打开新的创造区域的目的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Not only is the entity strengthened, but portions of it, having been actualized in three-dimensional existence, now add to the very quality and nature of that existence. Without this creativity, planetary life in your terms would always be sterile. The soul or entity then gives breath to the body, and to the three-dimensional self within it. The three-dimensional self then goes about its purpose of opening up new areas of creativity.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">换句话说，存有或灵魂，派出“部分的自己”以打开否则不会存在的实相的新途径。(9:39停了很久。)存在于这些实相之内的三次元自己，一定要把它们的注意力完全贯注于其中。一种内在的觉知给了他们精力与力量的泉源。但是，他们终究必须了解他们是在演戏，而“最后”从他们的角色，经过另一番领悟而返回到存有。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Entities or souls, in other words, send out portions of themselves to open up avenues of reality that would not exist otherwise. (Long pause at 9:39.) The three-dimensional selves, in existing within these realities, must focus their attention there completely. An inner awareness gives them a source of energy and strength. They must, however, come to understand their roles as actors, “finally” from their roles, and through another act of comprehension, return to the entity.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">有一些人是完全明白地出现在这些戏里。这些人格明知它们只是角色，而自愿扮演某个角色，以便引导其他的人迈向必须的了解与发展。他们引领演员们超越他们所创造的自己与背景，而看得更远。可以说这些由其他存在层面来的人格监督这出戏，而出现在演员之中。他们的目的是打开三次元自己内的那些心理门户，以释出三次元自己到另一实相系统中作进一步的发展。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There are those who appear within these plays fully aware. These personalities willingly take roles, knowing that they are roles, in order to lead the others toward the necessary realization and development. They lead the actors to see beyond the selves and settings they have created. These personalities from other levels of existence oversee the play, so to speak, and appear among the actors. Their purpose is to open up within the three-dimensional selves those psychological doorways that will release the three-dimensional self for further development in another system of reality.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在你可以休息，等下再继续。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now you may take your break and we shall continue.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:50。珍的出神状态比较浅。在9:58继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:50. Jane’s trance had been relatively light. Resume at 9:58.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：你们正在学做共同创造者(cocreators)。你们正在学着做“神”，就你们现在了解的“神”的意义来说。你们在学着负责任——任何一个个人化意识的责任。你在学着为了创造性的目的管理你自己这份能量。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: You are learning to be cocreators. You are learning to be gods as you now understand the term. You are learning responsibility ---- the responsibility of any individualized consciousness. You are learning to handle the energy that is yourself, for creative purposes.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你会与你所爱及所恨的人紧缚在一起，虽然你将学着放松、放掉，化解那恨。甚至你将学着创造性地运用恨，来把它转向更高的目的，最后把它转变成为爱。在以后的章节中我会更阐明此点。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You will be bound to those you love and those you Hate, though you will learn to release and lose and dissipate the Hatred. You will learn to use even Hatred creatively and to turn it to the higher ends, to transform it finally into love. I will make this clearer in later chapters.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你的物质环境里的背景，有时很可爱的那些行头设备，你所知生活的物质面，全都是伪装，因此我叫你的物质实相为一种伪装。这些伪装却是由宇宙的活力所组成的。岩石、石头、山岳与大地是活的伪装，由你无法知觉的微细意识形成互相连锁的心灵之网。在其内的原子与分子有它们自己的意识，就如你体内的原子分子也一样。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The settings in your physical environment, the sometimes lovely paraphernalia, the physical aspects of life as you know it, are all camouflages, and so I call your physical reality a camouflage. Yet these camouflages are composed of the vitality of the universe. The rocks and stones and mountains and earth are living camouflage, interlocking psychic webs formed by minute consciousnesses that you cannot perceive as such. The atoms and molecules within them have their own consciousness, as do the atoms and molecules with your body.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:07。)既然你们在形成这物质的背景中都插了一手，既然你把自己隐藏在一个肉体的形式中，那么应用肉体感官你只能感知这迷人的背景；而在其内或超越它的实相就逃过了你们的眼。可是，即使那演员也不仅是三次元的，他是一个多次元自己的一部分。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:07.) Since you all have a hand in forming this physical setting, and since you are ensconced yourself in a physical form, then using the physical senses you will only perceive this fantastic setting. The reality that exists both within it and beyond it will elude you. Even the actor is not entirely three-dimensional, however. He is a part of a multidimensional self.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在他内有些感知的方法可允许他看透伪装的背景，看穿舞台。他经常运用这些内在感官，虽然他自己的演员部分是如此地全神贯注于戏里而对此不察。以广义的方式来说，肉体感官实际上形成了它似乎唯一能感知的那个物质实相。它们自身即为伪装的一部分，但它们好似戴在你们天生内在感知上的眼镜，强迫你把一个眼前的活动领域 “看”作实物；因此你只能靠它们告诉你在表面上所发生的事。例如你能说出其他演员的位置或时钟的时间，但这些肉体感官却不会告诉你时间自身即为一假象，或意识形成其他的演员，或你所看不见的实相存在于那真是如此明显的实物之外。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Within him there are methods of perception that allow him to see through the camouflage settings, to see beyond the stage. He uses these inner senses constantly, though the actor part of himself is so intent upon the play that this escapes him. In a large manner, the physical senses actually form the physical reality they seem to only perceive. They are themselves part of the camouflage, but they are like lenses over your natural inner perceptions that force you to “see” an available field of activity as physical matter; and so they can be relied upon only to tell you what is happening in a superficial manner. You can tell the position of the other actors for example, or time by clock, but these physical senses will not tell you that time is itself a camouflage, or that consciousness forms the other actors, or that realities that you cannot see exist over and beyond the physical matter that is so apparent.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">但是，你却能用你的内在感官去感知存在于这出戏及你在其中角色之外的实相。当然，为了要做到这个，至少你必须暂时把你的注意力由正在发生的连续活动中转开——也就等于关上了你的肉体感官——把你的注意力移转到先前逃过你注意的那些事件。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You can, however, using your inner senses, perceive reality as it exists apart from the play and your role in it. In order to do this you must, of course, momentarily at least turn your attention away from the constant activity that is taking place ---- turn off the physical senses, as it were ---- and switch your attention to those events that have escaped you earlier.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:20。)的确是极端简化的说，这效果有些像是换戴另一副眼镜。因为基本上，对内我而言，肉体感官是人造的，就像对肉体自身而言，一副眼镜或助听器是人造的一样。因此，内在感官极少完全有意识地被用到。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:20.) Highly simplified indeed, the effect would be something like changing one set of glasses for another, for the physical senses are as artificial, basically speaking, to the inner self, as a set of glasses or a hearing aid is to the physical self. The inner senses, therefore, are but rarely used completely consciously.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">例如，如果在一刹那之间，如你所知的熟悉环境消失了，而被另一套你还没准备好去了解的资料取代，你不止会感到迷惑，更会相当害怕，由内在感官来的那么多资料必须转译为你能理解的用语。换言之，这种资料必须要想办法让做为三次元自身的你所了解。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You would be more than disoriented, for example, but quite terrified, if between one moment and the next your familiar environment as you knew it disappeared to be replaced by other sets of data that you were not ready to understand, so much information from the inner senses must be translated in terms that you can comprehend. Such information must somehow make sense to you as three-dimensional selves, in other words.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可要明白，你那特定的一套伪装并非仅有的一套。其他的实相有完全不同的系统，但所有的人格都有内在感官，那是意识的属性，经由这些内在感官通讯得以维持，而正常的有意识自身对这些通讯很少知悉。我部分的目的就是让你们知道这些通讯中的一些。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your particular set of camouflages is not the only set, you see. Other realities have entirely different systems, but all personalities have inner senses that are attributes of consciousness, and through these inner senses communications are maintained about which the normally conscious self knows little. Part of my purpose is to make some of these communications known.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:29。)那么，灵魂或存有并非阅读此书的你。你的环境不只是你所知的环绕你的世界，也还包括了你现在不集中焦点于其上的前生环境。你真正的环境是由你的思想与情感组合起来的，因为从这些你不只形成了这个实相，而且形成了你参与的每一个实相。(停顿了很久。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:29.) The soul or entity, then, is not the self that reads this book. Your environment is not simply the world about you as you know it, but also consists of Past-life environments upon which you are not now focusing. Your real environment is composed of your thoughts and feelings, for from these you form not only this reality but each reality in which you take part. (Long pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你真正的环境并没有你所知的时空。在你真正的环境里你也不需要字句，因为沟通是即时发生的。在你真正的环境里你形成你所知的物质实相。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your real environment is innocent of space and time as you know them. In your real environment you have no need for words, for communication is instantaneous. In your real environment you form the physical world that you know.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">内在感官允许你感知独立于物质形式之外的实相。因此我将要求你们全体暂且放弃你们的角色，而试试这简单的练习。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The inner senses will allow you to perceive the reality that is independent of physical form. I will ask you all to momentarily forsake your roles therefore, and to try this simple exercise.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在你们可以休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now you may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:36。珍这回的出神状态较深。她说：“我知道第一次我没进去那么深，因为我听到那警笛。”在约9:30时，一辆救火车经过离我们家两条街的地方；到现在珍才记得告诉我她听见了。“当赛斯在写书时我听到那种东西使我担忧。我不想扰乱了任何事……”</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:36. Jane’s trance had been deeper this time. “I know I wasn’t in as deep the first time,” she said, “because I heard that siren.” A fire engine had passed a couple of blocks away from our house at about 9:30; only now did Jane remember to tell me she’d heard it. “I worry when I hear things like that while Seth’s writing his book. I don’t want to mess anything up….”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在10:53恢复。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Resume at 10:53.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在，假装你在一个照亮了的舞台上，舞台就是你现在坐在里面的房间。闭上你的眼睛，假装灯光没了，背景消失了，而你是独自一人。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now, pretend that you are on a lighted stage, the stage being the room in which you now sit. Close your eyes and pretend that the lights have gone out, the setting has disappeared and you are alone.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">每件东西都是暗的。静下来。尽可能生动地想象内在感官的存在，暂且假装它们与你的肉体感官相应。从你心中除去所有的思绪与忧虑。保持接纳的心情，轻轻地倾听，不是听实质的声音，而是由内在感官来的声音。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Everything is dark. Be quiet. Imagine as vividly as you can the existence of inner senses. For now pretend that they correspond to your physical ones. Clear from your mind all thoughts and worries. Be receptive. Very gently listen, not to physical sounds but to sounds that come through the inner senses.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">影像可能会出现。接受它们像肉眼所见的东西一样的真切。假装有一个内在世界，而当你学着用这些内在感官去感知它时，它会对你显现出来。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Images may begin to appear. Accept them as sights quite as valid as those you see physically. Pretend that there is an inner world, and that it will be revealed to you as you learn to perceive it with these inner senses.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:58。)假装你这一辈子对这内在世界一直是盲目的，现在才慢慢的在其中看到东西。不要用你最初可能感知的不连贯影像或最初听到的声音来判断整个内在世界，因为你还在相当不完美地运用你的内在感官。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:58.) Pretend that you have been blind to this world all your life, and are now slowly gaining sight within it. Do not judge the whole inner world by the disjointed images that you may at first perceive, or by the sounds that you may at first hear, for you will still be using your inner senses quite imperfectly.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在睡前或休息状态做一会儿这简单的练习。甚至在做一件你不必全神贯注的普通工作当中，你也可以做这练习。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Do this simple exercise for a few moments before sleep or in the resting state. It may also be done even in the midst of an ordinary task that does not take all of your attention.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你将只是在学着把焦点集中于一个新的知觉次元，好比是在一个陌生环境里拍些快照。记住你将只感知到片段。就只接受它们，在这阶段不要试着做任何全盘的判断或诠释。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You will simply be learning to focus in a new dimension of awareness, taking quick snapshots, as it were, in a strange environment. Remember that you will only be perceiving snatches. Simply accept them, but do not attempt to make any overall judgments or interpretations at this stage.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">一开始每天做十分钟就相当够了。现在当我写此书时，书中的资料到某程度就是透过这个在出神状态的女士的内在感官而来。这种工作是极度有组织的内在精确性与训练的结果。在鲁柏强烈地聚焦于物质环境时，她不能由我处得到资料，资料不能被转译或诠释。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Ten minutes a day to begin with is quite sufficient. Now the information in this book is being directed to some extent through the inner senses of the woman who is in trance as I write it. Such endeavor is the result of highly organized inner precision, and of training. Ruburt could not receive the information from me, it could not be translated nor interpreted while she was focused intensely in the physical environment. So the inner senses are channels that provide communication between various dimensions of existence. Yet even here the information must be distorted to some extent as it is translated into physical terms. Otherwise it would not be perceived at all.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此内在感官是在各种不同的存在次元之间提供通讯的管道，然则即使如此，当资料被转译为具体形式时仍免不了有某种程度的扭曲。不然的话，它根本完全不能被感知。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>End of dictation. Do you have questions?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">口述结束，你有问题吗？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Nothing in particular, I guess.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“我想没什么特别的问题。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Whenever you want a less formal session, or have questions, then let me know.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">当你要一个比较不正式的课，或有问题，那就让我知道。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“I will.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“我会的。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Humorously): I am willing to take time out from my writing chores.</details><br>
