<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：我们将继续已开始的一章。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: We will continue with the chapter we began.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">许多人想象灵魂即一个不朽化的自我(immortalized ego)，却忘了你所知的自我只是自己的一小部分；也就是说，人格的这一段就这么永无止境地被继续投射下去。由于你们很少了解到你们实相的幅度，所以你们的观念必然是很狭窄的。在思考“不朽”时，人类似乎希望发展出更长远的自我，但他又反对这种发展可能涉及改变的观念。经由他的宗教，他说他的确是有灵魂的，却问都没问灵魂是什么，再次的，他似乎常常把它当作是他拥有的一样物件。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Many individuals imagine the soul to be an immortalized ego, forgetting that the ego as you know it is only a small portion of the self; so this section of the personality is simply projected onward, ad infinitum, so to speak. Because the dimensions of your reality are so little understood, your concepts are bound to be limited. In considering “immortality,” mankind seems to hope for further egotistical development, and yet he objects to the idea that such development might involve change. He says through his religions that he has a soul indeed, without even asking what a soul is, and often he seems to regard it, again, as an object in his possession.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">即使是如你所知的人格，也是不断在变的，并且不常是按照你预期的方式——事实上，多半是以不可预料的方式。你坚持把你的注意力聚焦于你自己行为里点点滴滴的相似点(similarities)；而在上面建立起一个理论，说“自己”幻构出来一个模式而遵循它，其实那是你置换在它上面的模式。而这经过置换的模式阻止你看到真实的自己。因此，你也把这扭曲的看法投射到你对灵魂实相的观念上。因此，你以对你“必朽的自己”本质所持的错误观念来想你的灵魂。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now personality, even as you know it, constantly changes, and not always in ways that are anticipated ---- most often, in fact, in unpredictable ways. You insist upon focusing your attention upon the similarities that are woven through your own behavior; and upon these you build a theory that the self follows a pattern that you, instead, have transposed upon it. And the transposed pattern prevents you from seeing the self as it really is. Therefore, you also project this distorted viewpoint upon your conception of the reality of the soul. You think of the soul, therefore, in the light of erroneous conceptions that you hold regarding even the nature of your mortal selves.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:25)你要明白，即使是“必朽的自己”都比你所知觉的要神奇和奇妙得多，并拥有比你所归给它多得多的能力。即使只就“必朽的自己”而言，你也尚未了解感知的真正本质，所以你几乎不可能了解灵魂的感知。因为灵魂首要的就是感知与创造。再记住你现在就是一个灵魂。因此，在你之内的灵魂现在就在感知。它现在感知的方法与你的肉体未生前及死亡后都是一样的。因此基本上你的内在部分、灵魂质(the soul stuff)，在肉体死后并不会突然改变它的感知方法或它的特性。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:25.) Even the mortal self, you see, is far more miraculous and wondrous than you perceive, and possesses far more abilities than you ascribe to it. You do not understand as yet the true nature of perception, even as far as the mortal self is concerned, and therefore you can hardly understand the perceptions of the soul. For the soul, above all, perceives and creates. Remember again that you are a soul now. The soul within you, therefore, is now perceiving. Its methods of perception are the same now as they were before your physical birth, and as they will be after your physical death. So basically the inner portion of you, the soul-stuff, will not suddenly change its methods of perception nor its characteristics after physical death.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">所以，你现在就可以发现灵魂是什么。它不是在你死的时候等着你的某样东西，也不是什么你必须拯救或赎回的东西，它并且也是某样你不可能失去的东西。“失落或拯救你的灵魂”这句话被大大地误解和扭曲，因为它是你确实不可毁灭的那个部分。在本书谈到宗教与神的观念那一部分中我们再详加讨论。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You can find out what the soul is now, therefore. It is not something waiting for you at your death, nor is it something you must save or redeem, and it is also something that you cannot lose. The term, “to lose or save your soul”, has been grossly misinterpreted and distorted, for it is the part of you that is indeed indestructible. We will go into this particular matter in a portion of the book dealing with religion and the god concept.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你所知的你自己这个人格，你认为最宝贵、最独特的你的那部分，也是永不能毁灭或失落的。它是灵魂的一部分。它既不会被灵魂吞蚀、也不会被抹煞、更不会被征服；在另一方面，它也不能从灵魂分离。不过，它只是你灵魂的一个面向。你的个人性——不论你怎么想它——继续存在。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your own personality as you know it, that portion of you that you consider most precious, most uniquely you, will also never be destroyed or lost. It is a portion of the soul. It will not be gobbled by the soul, nor erased by it, nor subjugated by it; nor on the other hand can it ever be separated. It is, nevertheless, only one aspect of your soul. Your individuality, in whatever way you want to think of it, continues to exist in your terms.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">它继续生长、发展，但它的生长与发展极为依赖它是否领悟到：它虽是明确的、个人的，但它也只是灵魂的一种示现而已。按照它对此领悟的程度，它于是学会舒展创造性，并使用那些与生俱来的能力。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It continues to grow and develop, but its growth and development is highly dependent upon its realization that while it is distinct and individual, it is also but one manifestation of the soul. To the extent that it realizes this, it learns to unfold in creativity, and to use those abilities that lie inherent within it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在不幸的是，如果只告诉你，你的个人性继续存在并就此打住，那要容易得多。虽然这可视作一个相当合理的寓言，而且它以前就曾以那特定的方式告诉给人们，但这个故事的过于单纯化正就是危险所在。真相是，你现在的人格与你过去和将来的人格——以你所了解的时间来说——所有这些人格全是灵魂——你的灵魂——的示现。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now unfortunately, it would be much easier simply to tell you that your individuality continues to exist, and let it go at that. While this would make a fairly reasonable parable, it has been told in that particular way before, and there are dangers in the very simplicity of the tale. The truth is that the personality you are now and the personality that you have been and will be ---- in the terms in which you understand time ---- all of these personalities are manifestations of the soul, of your soul.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:42)因此你的灵魂——你现在的灵魂——你为其一部分的灵魂——那灵魂是一个远比你先前假设的更富创造性与更神奇的现象。如前面所提及的，当你们对这点没有明白了解，当你们为了单纯化的缘故而把这观念加以稀释，那么你们就永远无法了解灵魂的强烈活力。因此，你的灵魂具足由所有这些其他人格的经验淬取到的智慧、资料与知识；而在你内你有通达这些资料的通路，但唯有当你领悟到你实相的真实本质。让我再强调这些人格在灵魂内独立存在着，只是其一部分，他们中每一个都可以自由地创造与发展。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:42.) Your soul therefore ---- the soul that you are ---- the soul that you are part of ---- that soul is a far more creative and miraculous phenomenon than you previously supposed. And when this is not clearly understood, and when the concept is watered down for simplicity’s sake, as mentioned earlier, then the intense vitality of the soul can never be understood. Your soul, therefore, possesses the wisdom, information, and knowledge that is part of the experience of all these other personalities; and you have within yourselves access to this information, but only if you realize the true nature of your reality. Let me emphasize again that these personalities exist independently within and are a part of the soul, and each of them are free to create and develop.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">但是却有一种内在的沟通，一个人的知识可提供给任何别人——不在肉身死后，却就在当下这一刻。现在，如我前面说过的，灵魂本身不是静态的。它甚至透过组成它的那些人格的经验生长与发展。尽量简单地说，它大于其各部分的总和。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There is however an inner communication, and the knowledge of one is available to any ---- not after physical death, but now in your present moment. Now the soul itself, as mentioned earlier, is not static. It grows and develops even through the experience of those personalities that compose it, and it is, to put it as simply as possible, more than the sum of its parts.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:50)现在，在实相中没有封闭的系统。在你的物质系统中，你知觉的本质多少局限了你对实相的概念，因为你有意地决定把你的焦点集中在一定的“现场”(locale)里，但基本来说，意识永不可能是个封闭的系统，所有这种性质的障碍都是幻相。因此灵魂本身不是个封闭的系统。但是，当你想到灵魂，你常常这样子想它——一个心灵或精神不变的堡垒。但堡垒不只是把侵略者挡在外面，它们也阻止了扩张与发展。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:50.) Now, there are no closed systems in reality. In your physical system the nature of your perceptions limits your idea of reality to some extent, because you purposely decide to focus within a given “locale.” But basically speaking, consciousness can never be a closed system, and all barriers of such a nature are illusion . Therefore the soul itself is not a closed system. When you consider the soul, however, you usually think of it in such a light ---- unchanging, a psychic or spiritual citadel. But citadels not only keep out invaders, they also prevent expansion and development.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">此地有许多事情很难以言语来形容，例如，因为你替你的“本体感”这么担心，所以你抵抗这个概念，即灵魂是一个开放的精神系统，一个创造力的发电场，向各方向射出——然而事实的确是如此。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There are many matter here very difficult to express in words, for you are so afraid for your sense of identity that you resist the idea that the soul, for example, is an open spiritual system, a powerhouse of creativity that shoots out in all directions ---- and yet this is indeed the case.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我告诉你们这个，也同时提醒你们，你们现在的人格永不会失落。灵魂的另一个字眼是存有。你晓得要给你一个对灵魂或存有的定义并不是简单的事，因为即使要以逻辑的方式来对它略为探讨，你也必须在精神上、心灵上、电磁学上了解它，并且也了解意识与行动的基本天性。但是你却能直觉地发现灵魂或存有的本质，在许多方面，直觉的知识比任何别的都要高超。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I tell you this, and at the same time remind you that your present personality is never lost. Now another word for the soul is entity. You see it is not a simple matter of giving you a definition of a soul or entity, for even to have a glimpse in logical terms you would have to understand it in spiritual, psychic, and electromagnetic terms, and understand the basic nature of consciousness and action as well. But you can intuitively discover the nature of the soul or entity, and in many ways intuitive knowledge is superior to any other kind.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">要对灵魂有这样直觉性了解的一个先决条件，就在想要达成它的愿望。如果愿望够强，那么你便会自动被引导到会带给你生动、明确主观知识的那些经验。有些方法能让你做到这个，在本书快结束时我会给你一些方法。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>One prerequisite for such an intuitive understanding of the soul is the desire to achieve it. If the desire is strong enough, then you will be automatically led to experiences that will result in vivid, unmistakable subjective knowledge. There are methods that will enable you to do this, and I will give you some toward the end of this book.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:02)至于现在，这儿有一个简单却十分有效的练习。当你读到这里时，闭上你的眼，试着在你内心感觉自己呼吸和生命力所由来的动力之源。你们中有的人第一次尝试就会成功，其他人也许得多花些时间。当你感觉到在你之内的这个源头，就试着感觉这力量由你整个肉体，经由指尖与脚尖，经由你身体的毛孔，以你自己为中心向各方流出。想象其光芒不减，然后透过树叶及上空的云彩，透过下方的地球中心，甚至扩展到宇宙的终极。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:02.) For now, here is one quite effective but simple exercise. Close your eyes after having read this chapter to this point, and try to sense within yourself the source of power from which your own breathing and life forces come. Some of you will do this successfully at your first try. Others may take longer. When you feel within yourself this source, then try to sense this power flow outward through your entire physical being, through the fingertips and toes, through the pores of your body, all directions, with yourself as center. Imagine the rays undiminished, reaching then through the foliage and clouds above, through the center of the earth below, extending even to the farthest reaches of the universe.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我的意思并不是指这只是一个象征性的练习，因为它虽以想象开始，却是建立在事实上的，由你意识和灵魂的创造力所发散出的东西，的确是以那种方式向外伸展的。这练习会给你对灵魂的真正本质、创造力与活力一些概念，由你的灵魂，你可以汲取自己的精力，而且你是它的一个个别而独特的部分。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now I do not mean this to be merely a symbolic exercise, for though it may begin with imagination, it is based upon fact, and emanations from your consciousness and the creativity of your soul do indeed reach outward in that manner. The exercise will give you some idea of the true nature, creativity, and vitality of the soul from which you can draw your own energy and of which you are an individual and unique portion.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(幽默地：)你可以休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Humorously): You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“谢谢。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Thank you.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:10。珍曾在很深的出神状态，她的速度很快，停顿很少。她说，赛斯可以很愉快而不间断地继续下去，只因我故意让我疲乏的右手猛地落在沙发上，他才叫停。珍感觉很好，她不觉得已过了一个钟头。注意已讲资料的份量。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:10. Jane had been in a deep trance; her pace had been fast, with few pauses. Seth, she said, could have cheerfully continued unabated. He called a break only because I deliberately let my weary right hand flop down on the couch. Jane felt well. She had no sense of an hour’s having passed. Note the amount of material delivered.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(一如常例，珍说她对5月4号所给的此章第一部分没有印象。在10:27以同样快的方式继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(As is often the case, Jane said she had no memory of the first portion of the chapter, given on May 4. Resume in the same fast manner at 10:27.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这个讨论并无意成为一种玄秘的表演，而对你的日常生活没有实际的意义。事实是，在你对自己的实相持着狭窄的观念时，你就无法对自身的许多才能加以实际的利用；而当你对灵魂有一个偏狭的观念时，那么到某个程度，你便把自己由你存在和创造的源头切断了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: This discussion is not meant to be an esoteric presentation with little practical meaning in your daily lives. The fact is that while you hold limited concepts of your own reality, then you cannot practically take advantage of many abilities that are your own; and while you have a limited concept of the soul, then to some extent you cut yourself off from the source of your own being and creativity.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">且说，不论你知道与否，这些能力都是在运作的，但通常它们并不是在你有意识的合作下运作，而是虽然你不知，它们仍在运作；而常常当你真的发现自己在用它们时，你就会大为惊恐，不知所措，或感到困惑。不论人家以前是怎么教你的，你必须了解，举例来说，基本上，感知不是肉体性的。如果你发现自己正在用肉体感官以外的什么来感知资料，那么你必须接受这就是感知运用的方式。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now these abilities operate whether you know it or not, but often they operate in spite of you rather than with your conscious cooperation; and often when you do find yourself using them, you become frightened, disoriented, or confused. No matter what you have been taught, you must understand, for example, that basically speaking, perceptions are not physical in the way the term is usually used. If you catch yourself perceiving information through other than your physical senses, then you must accept the fact that this is the way perception works.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">通常发生的是，你对实相的观念是如此狭窄，不论何时，当你感知到任何不合于你的观念的经验时，你就受惊了。我并不是只在说那些被泛称为“超感官知觉”的能力。这些经验对你而言好像超乎寻常，只因你久已否认任何非经由肉体感官而来的感知之存在。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>What often happens is that your conception of reality is so limited that you take fright whenever you perceive any experience that does not fit into your conception. Now I am not speaking merely of abilities loosely called “extrasensory perception.” These experiences seem extraordinary to you only because you have for so long denied the existence of any perception that did not come through the physical senses.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">所谓“超感官知觉”，只给了你对内我收受资讯的基本方法一个粗浅而扭曲的概念，但围绕着超感官知觉建立的观念至少较接近事实，并代表了对“所有感知基本上是肉体性”概念的一种改进。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>So-called extrasensory perception gives you but a crude and distorted idea of the basic ways in which the inner self receives information, but the concepts built around extrasensory perception are at least nearer the truth, and as such represent an improvement over the idea that all perception is basically physical.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那么，几乎不可能把对“灵魂本质”的讨论与对“感知本质”的讨论分开。让我们简短地重温几点：你们形成你们所知的物质及物质世界。肉体感官确实可说是创造了物质世界，就在于它们强迫你以肉体去感知一个可用的能量场，并且在这实相的场域上强加了一个极为专门化的模式。用肉体感官，你只能如此感知实相。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now it is nearly impossible to separate a discussion of the nature of the soul from a discussion of the nature of perception. Very briefly let us review a few points: You form physical matter and the physical world that you know. The physical senses actually can be said to create the physical world, in that they force you to perceive an available field of energy in physical terms, and impose a highly specialized pattern upon this field of reality. Using the physical senses, you can perceive reality in no other way.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:44)这肉体的感知绝没有改变内我本有的、基本的、不受束缚的感知，那是内我的特性，而内我即为你内在灵魂的一部分。内我知道它与灵魂的关系。你可以说，它是“我”的一部分，做为灵魂与目前人格之间的信差。你也必须领悟，虽则我用像“灵魂”或“存有”、“内我”与“目前人格”这些术语，我这样做只是“方便”说法，因为其一即另一个的一部分；并没有一个“点”，在那儿一个开始而另一个结束。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:44.) This physical perception in no way alters the native, basic, unfettered perception that is characteristic of the inner self, the inner self being the portion of the soul that is within you. The inner self knows its relationship with the soul. It is a portion of the self that acts, you might say, as a messenger between the soul and the present personality. You must also realize that while I use terms like “soul” or “entity,” “inner self,” and “present personality,” I do so only for the sake of convenience, for one is a part of the other; there is no point where one begins and another ends.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如果你想想心理学家用，“自我”、“潜意识”，甚或“无意识”这些术语的方式，你自己便能很容易地明白这些。那些在一瞬前似乎为潜意识的东西，可能下一刹那就成了有意识的。一个无意识的动机在某一点也可以是有意识的。即使在这些用语中，你的经验也应告诉你，文字本身造成了在你自己经验中并不存在的分界。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You can see this easily for yourself if you consider the way in which psychologists use the terms “ego,” “subconscious,” and even “unconscious.” What seems subconscious in one instant may be conscious the next. An unconscious motive may also be conscious at one point. Even in these terms your experience should tell you that the words themselves make divisions that do not exist in your own experience.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">看起来你似乎单单由你的肉体感官来感知，但你只要扩张你对实相的自我本位概念，你就会发现，即使是你自我本位的自己，也十分容易接受非物质性资讯的存在。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You seem to perceive exclusively through your physical senses, and yet you have only to extend your egotistical idea of reality, and you will find even your egotistical self accepting quite readily the existence of nonphysical information.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在10:53停顿。)当“自我”这样做时，它对自己本质的概念就会自动改变而扩张，因为你已移去了对它成长的限制。现在，任何感知的活动改变了感知者，因此灵魂——被当作一个感知者——也必须改变。在感知者与似乎被感知的东西之间并没有真正的分界，被感知的东西往往是感知者的一个延伸。这可能看起来很奇怪，但所有的活动都是精神性的，或你要说心灵的活动也可以。这是一个极端简单的解释；但思想创造实相。然后思想的创造者感知物体，他不了解在他与这似乎是分离的东西之间的联系。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 10:53.) As it does, so its own ideas of its own nature will automatically change and expand, for you will have removed limitations to its growth. Now any act of perception changes the perceiver, and so the soul, considered as a perceiver, must also change. There are no real divisions between the perceiver and the thing seemingly perceived. In many ways the thing perceived is an extension of the perceiver. This may seem strange, but all acts are mental, or if you prefer, psychic acts. This is an extremely simple explanation; but the thought creates the reality. Then the creator of the thought perceives the object, and he does not understand the connection between him and this seemingly separate thing.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这将思想与情感具体化成为物质实相的特性，是灵魂的一种属性。现在在你的实相中，这些思想被造成实质。在其他的实相，它们可能以完全不同的方式“被建构”。因此你的灵魂，即你，从你思想与期望的本质建构出你实质的每日实相。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This characteristic of materializing thoughts and feelings into physical realities is an attribute of the soul. Now in your reality, these thoughts are made physical. In other realities, they may be “constructed” in an entirely different fashion. So your soul, that which you are, constructs your physical daily reality for you from the nature of your thoughts and expectations.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">所以，你很容易看出来，你的主观感觉真的有多重要。这知识——即你的宇宙是意念所建构的——能立即给你线索，使你能改善你的环境与情境。当你不了解灵魂的本质，没领悟到是你的思想与感觉形成物质实相时，你就会觉得无力改变它。在本书的后几章，我想要给你们一些实用的资料，使你能实际地改变日常生活的真正本质与结构。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You can readily see, therefore, how important your subjective feelings really are. This knowledge ---- that your universe is idea construction ---- can immediately give you clues that enable you to change your environment and circumstances beneficially. When you do not understand the nature of the soul, and do not realize that your thoughts and feelings form physical reality, then you feel powerless to change it. In later chapters of this book, I hope to give you some practical information that will enable you to alter practically the very nature and structure of daily life.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(珍身为赛斯，带笑地向前倾。)你累了吧？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane, as Seth, leaned forward, smiling.) Do you grow weary?</details><br>
