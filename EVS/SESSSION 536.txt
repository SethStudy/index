<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 535,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第535节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>JUNE 17, 1970, 9:00 P.M. WEDNESDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1970年6月17日 星期三 晚上9：00</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The regularly scheduled sessions for June 10 and 15 were not held, so that Jane could rest. We did conduct one quite successful experiment on our own, however, involving hypnosis during my trip to the dentist. Jane held her ESP class last night, but had no session.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(6月10日与15日的定期课没有举行，以便让珍休息。不过在我去看牙医的途中，我们自己确曾做了一个相当成功的催眠实验。昨晚珍上了她的ESP课，但赛斯没有出现。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will begin Part Two, Chapter Nine, and we will title this, “The Death Experience.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们将开始第二部，第九章。我们给它命名为〈“死亡”经验〉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>What happens at the point of death? The question is much more easily asked than answered. Basically there is not any particular point of death in those terms, even in the case of a sudden accident. I will attempt to give you a practical answer to what you think of as this practical question, however. What the question really means to most people is this: What will happen when I am not alive in physical terms any longer? What will I feel? Will I still be myself? Will the emotions that propelled me in life continue to do so? Is there a heaven or a hell? Will I be greeted by gods or demons, enemies, or beloved ones? Most of all the question means: When I am dead, will I still be who I am now, and will I remember those who are dear to me now?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在濒死的一刹那发生了什么？这个问题问起来比答起来容易得多。基本上说，“死亡”并没有发生在所谓的一个特定点，即使在突发的意外中也是一样。不过对这个你以为实际的问题，我也要试着给你一个实际的答案。对大多数人而言，这个问题的真正意义是：当我就肉体来说不再是活着的时候，会发生什么？我感觉如何？我还是我自己吗？在我活着时推动我的那些情感仍会继续推动我吗？有没有天堂或地狱？是神或魔、敌人或者我所爱的人来迎接我？最重要的问题是：当我死了，我仍旧是现在的我吗？我还记得那些我现在所爱的人吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I will answer the questions in those terms also, then; but before I do so, there are several seemingly impractical considerations concerning the nature of life and death, with which we must deal.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，我也用那种用语来回答问题。但在我如此做之前，有几个关乎生死本质的似乎不实际的考虑，是我们必须处理的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>First of all, let us consider the fact just mentioned. There is no separate, indivisible, specific point of death. Life is a state of becoming, and death is a part of this process of becoming. You are alive now, a consciousness knowing itself, sparkling with cognition amid a debris of dead and dying cells; alive while the atoms and molecules of your body die and are reborn. You are alive, therefore, in the midst of small deaths; portions of your own image crumble away moment by moment and are replaced, and you scarcely give the matter a thought. So you are to some extent now alive in the midst of the death of yourself ---- alive despite, and yet because of, the multitudinous deaths and rebirths that occur within your body in physical terms.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>首先，让我们考虑刚才说过的事实：并没有一个分离的、不可分的、特定的死亡点。生命是一个变为的状况，而死亡是这变为过程的一部分。你现在活着，你认识它自己的意识，在已死与正在死的细胞残骸中间闪耀着认知力。你活着，同时你身体的原子和分子死了又复生。因此，你是活在许多“小死亡”的中间；你自己形象的一部分一刻刻地崩溃掉而又被取代，你却几乎想都不想这件事。因此在某个程度，你现在是活在自己的死亡之中——就身体来说，在你的身体内发生了众多的死亡与重生，纵使如此，却也正因如此，你仍然活着。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If the cells did not die and were not replenished, the physical image would not continue to exist, so now in the present, as you know it, your consciousness flickers about your ever-changing corporeal image.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果细胞没死，也没被补充，肉体形象不会继续存在，因此在现在，如你所知，你的意识在你永远在变化的肉体形象周围闪烁。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In many ways you can compare your consciousness as you know it now to a firefly, for while it seems to you that your consciousness is continuous, this is not so. It also flickers off and on, though as we mentioned earlier, it is never completely extinguished. Its focus is not nearly as constant as you suppose, however. So as you are alive in the midst of your own multitudinous small deaths, so though you do not realize it, you are often “dead,” even amid the sparkling life of your own consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在许多方面，你可以把现在所知的意识比为萤火虫，虽然在你看来你的意识好像是连续的，其实不然。它也是闪烁不已、时明时暗的。如我们先前说过的，它永远不会完全熄灭。可是，它的焦点远不如你假设的那么恒常不变。因此正如你在自己众多的小死亡中活着，虽然你没领悟到，甚至在你自己意识的闪耀生命中，你其实也常是“死的”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I am using your own terms here. By “dead,” therefore, I mean completely unfocused in physical reality. Now your consciousness, quite simply, is not physically alive, physically oriented, for exactly the same amount of time as it is physically alive and oriented.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我在用你们自己的说法。因此，说到“死亡”，我是指完全不聚焦于物质实相内。现在十分简单的，当你的意识活在肉体里时，它其实也不是所有的时间都活在肉体里、并且定位于肉体里的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Typing this on June 22, I wondered if I transcribed what Seth had said correctly. Jane and I decided that I had ---- and it does make sense.) This may sound confusing, but hopefully we shall make it clearer. There are pulsations of consciousness, though again you may not be aware of them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在6月22日打字时，我奇怪我有没有把赛斯的话转录正确。珍和我决定我有——而它的确是合理的。)这听起来可能很混乱，但我希望我们会把它弄得较清楚。意识是有脉动的，虽然再次的，你可能没能觉察它们。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Consider this analogy. For one instant your consciousness is “alive,” focused in physical reality. Now for the next instant it is focused somewhere else entirely, in a different system of reality. It is unalive, or “dead” to your way of thinking. The next instant it is “alive” again, focused in your reality, but you are not aware of the intervening instant of unaliveness. Your sense of continuity therefore is built up entirely on every other pulsation of consciousness. Is that clear to you?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>想想这个比喻。你的意识有一瞬是“活着”，聚焦于物质实相里。在下一瞬它完全聚焦于别处，在一个不同的实相系统里。对你的思想方式来说，它不是活的，或是它“死了”。下一瞬它又“活了”，聚焦于你的实相，但你却不觉察那介入的“不活”瞬间。因此你的连续感是完全建立在相间隔的意识脉动上。这你清楚吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.” Pause at 9:25.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“清楚。”在9:25休息。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Remember this is an analogy, so that the word “instant” should not be taken too literally. There is, then, what we can call an underside of consciousness. Now, in the same way, atoms and molecules exist so that they are “dead,” or inactive within your system, then alive or active, but you cannot perceive the instant in which they do not exist. Since your bodies and your entire physical universe are composed of atoms and molecules, then I am telling you that the entire structure exists in the same manner. It flickers off and on, in other words, and in a certain rhythm, as, say, the rhythm of breath.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>记住这是一个比喻，因此“一瞬”不能太实在的诠释。那么，有我们所谓意识的一个背面(an underside of consciousness)。现在，原子与分子以同样的方式存在，因此它们在你们的系统内是“死了”或不活动，然后又活了或又活动，但你不知觉它们不存在的那一瞬。既然你的身体和整个物质宇宙都是由原子和分子所组成，那么我要告诉你，整个结构也以同样方式存在。换言之，它闪烁生灭，并且以某种节奏，如呼吸的节奏，在生灭。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are overall rhythms, and within them an infinity of individual variations ---- almost like cosmic metabolism. In these terms, what you call death is simply the insertion of a longer duration of that pulsation of which you are not aware, a long pause in that other dimension, so to speak.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有一个全盘的节奏，在它们之内有无穷的个人性变化——几乎像是宇宙的新陈代谢。以这种说法，你们所谓的死亡只不过是插入了较长一段那不为你知觉的脉动，可说是在另一个实相里作较长的停留。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The death, say, of physical tissue, is merely a part of the process of life as you know it in your system, a part of the process of becoming. And from those tissues, as you know, new life will spring.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>至于肉体组织的死亡，只是你们系统中你所知生命过程的一部分，“变为”过程的一部分。如你所知，从那些组织中新的生命将会萌芽。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Consciousness ---- human consciousness ---- is not dependent upon the tissues, and yet there is no physical matter that is not brought into being by some portion of consciousness. For example, when your individual consciousness has left the body in a way that I will shortly explain, then the simple consciousnesses of atoms and molecules remain, and are not annihilated.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>意识——人类意识——并不依赖肉体的组织，所有的物质却莫不由意识的某部分带入存在。例如，当你个人的意识以我不久即将解释的一种方式离开了身体，那时原子和分子的简单意识仍维持着，没有被摧毁。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take a break and we shall continue.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一下，我们将再继续。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Do you have a title for Part One of your book?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“你有没有一个标题给你书的第一部？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I do not yet. The title I gave you is only for Chapter Nine. Since we are getting down to specifics, I will title the chapters individually.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我还没有。我才给你的标题是第九章的。既然我们现在谈到了细节，我会给每一章单独的标题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:40. Jane was well dissociated. Resume at 9:57.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:40。珍的出神状态很深。在9:57继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: In your present situation you arbitrarily consider yourselves to be dependent upon one given physical image: You identify yourself with your body.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：在你目前的情况，你武断地认为自己是依赖一个指定的肉体形象：你与自己的肉体认同。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As mentioned earlier, all through your lifetime, portions of that body die, and the body that you have now does not contain one particle of physical matter that “it” had, say ten years ago. Your body is completely different now, then, than it was ten years ago. The body that you had ten years ago, my dear readers, is dead. Yet obviously you do not feel that you are dead, and you are quite able to read this book with the eyes that are composed of completely new matter. The pupils, the “identical” pupils that you have now, did not exist ten years ago, and yet there seems to be no great gap in your vision.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如先前说过的，终你一生，那个身体有部分死去，而你现在所有的身体没有包含一粒“它”十年以前所有的物质。那么，你的身体现在与十年前是完全不同了。我亲爱的读者，你十年前所有的身体已经死了。你却显然不觉得你已经死了，而你很能够用你那由全新物质组成的双眼来读这本书。那瞳仁，你现有的“完全相同的”瞳仁，十年前并不存在，你的视力却似乎没有太大的差别。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This process, you see, continues so smoothly that you are not aware of it. The pulses mentioned earlier are so short in duration that your consciousness skips over them merrily, yet your physical perception cannot seem to bridge the gap when the longer rhythm of pulsation occurs. And so this is the time that you perceive as death. What you want to know, therefore, is what happens when your consciousness is directed away from physical reality, and when momentarily it seems to have no image to wear.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可明白，这过程继续得如此平滑，以致你根本不知不觉。前所提及的脉动，时间是那么的短，你的意识得以快活地跃过它们，但当发生了较长的脉动节奏时，你肉体的感知无法跨越这间隙。因此这就是你感知为死亡的时候了。所以，你想知道的是，当你的意识从物质实相被引开，而一时间仿佛没有形象可穿时，发生了什么事？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Quite practically speaking, there is no one answer, for each of you is an individual. Generally speaking, of course, there is an answer that will serve to cover main issues of this experience, but the kinds of deaths have much to do with the experience that consciousness undergoes. Also involved is the development of the consciousness itself, and its overall characteristic method of handling experience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>相当实际地说，并没有单一的标准答案，因为你们每个人都是个个体。当然，一般说来，有一个答案可供回答死亡经验的主要问题，但死亡的类别与意识所遭遇的经验大有关系，也涉及意识本身的发展程度，以及它整个处理经验的独特方法。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The ideas that you have involving the nature of reality will strongly color your experiences, for you will interpret them in the light of your beliefs, even as now you interpret daily life according to your ideas of what is possible or not possible. Your consciousness may withdraw from your body slowly or quickly, according to many variables.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你对实相的本质怀有什么概念将强烈地渲染你的经验，因为你将以你的信念来诠释经验，正如现在你以你认为什么是可能、什么是不可能的概念来诠释你的日常生活。你的意识离开身体的快慢，依据许多的变数。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:11.) In many cases of senility, for example, the strongly organized portions of personality have already left the body, and are meeting the new circumstances. The fear of death itself can cause such a psychological panic that out of a sense of self-preservation and defense you lower your consciousness so that you are in a state of coma, and you may take some time to recover.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:11暂停。)例如在许多老耄的例子里，人格极有组织的部分已然离开了身体，而正在认识新的环境。对死亡的恐惧本身能造成这么大的心理恐慌，以致你为了自保与自卫而降低你的意识，从而陷入一种昏迷状态，遂进入死亡。这也许要花些时间才能恢复(译注：指死亡后)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>A belief in hell fires can cause you to hallucinate Hades’ conditions. A belief in a stereotyped heaven can result in a hallucination of heavenly conditions. You always form your own reality according to your ideas and expectations. This is the nature of consciousness in whatever reality it finds itself. Such hallucinations, I assure you, are temporary.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>相信地狱之火会使你发生地府情况的幻觉。对样板天堂的信念能引起天堂似的情景幻境。你永远按照你的概念和期望形成自己的实相，这是意识的天性，不论意识发现它自己在何种实相中。我向你保证这种幻相只是暂时性的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Consciousness must use its abilities. The boredom and stagnation of a stereotyped heaven will not for long content the striving consciousness. There are teachers to explain the conditions and circumstances. You are not left alone, therefore, lost in mazes of hallucination. You may or may not realize immediately that you are dead in physical terms.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>意识一定要用它的能力。一个样板天堂的乏味与沉滞不会长久满足奋发努力的意识。会有老师来解释死后的情况与环境。所以，你没被孤单地留下，迷失于幻觉的迷宫中。在死后你也许立即明白你的肉身已死了，你也可能并不明白。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:20.) You will find yourself in another form, an image that will appear physical to you to a large degree, as long as you do not try to manipulate within the physical system with it. Then the differences between it and the physical body will become obvious.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:20)你会发现自己在另一种形体中，这个形体在你看来大致是实体的，只要你不试图在物质系统中操纵它，否则的话，它与肉体之间的不同便会昭然若揭了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If you firmly believe that your consciousness is a product of your physical body, then you may attempt to cling to it. There is an order of personalities, an honorary guard, so to speak, who are ever ready to lend assistance and aid, however.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你坚决相信你的意识是肉体的产物，那么你也许会试图抓紧肉体不放。不过，有一类的“人”格，可以说是荣誉保护人，他们随时准备给你辅助和帮忙。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now this honorary guard is made up of people in your terms both living and dead. Those who are living in your system of reality perform these activities in an “out-of-body” experience while the physical body sleeps. They are familiar with the projection of consciousness, with the sensations involved, and they help orient those who will not be returning to the physical body.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这种荣誉保护人是以你们说来还活着或已死之人所组成的。那些还活在你们实相系统的人，当肉体在睡眠时，在“出体”经验里执行这些活动。他们熟悉意识的投射及其所涉及的感觉，而他们帮助那些不再回到肉体的人熟悉这一切。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:26.) These people are particularly helpful because they are still involved with physical reality, and have a more immediate understanding of the feelings and emotions involved at your end. Such persons may or may not have a memory of their nightly activities. Experiences with projection of consciousness and knowledge of the mobility of consciousness, are therefore very helpful as preparations for death. You can experience the after-death environment beforehand, so to speak, and learn the conditions that will be encountered.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:26)这些人特别有用，因为他们仍与物质实相有牵连，对死亡者所涉及的感觉与情感有更切身的了解。这种人对他们夜间的活动或有记忆或没有。所以说，对意识投射的经验和意识动机性的知识，对准备他们自己将来的死亡是非常有用的。你能事先体验死后的环境，明白你会遭遇到的情形。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This is not, incidentally, necessarily any kind of somber endeavor, nor are the after-death environments somber at all. To the contrary, they are generally far more intense and joyful than the reality you now know.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>附带地说，这并不必然是一种阴郁的工作，死后的环境也并不阴沉。相反地，它们比你现在所知的实相往往要热烈和快乐得多。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You will simply be learning to operate in a new environment in which different laws apply, and the laws are far less limiting than the physical ones with which you now operate. In other words, you must learn to understand and use new freedoms.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>其实你只是学着在一个新的环境里运作，在其中适用不同的法则，而这些法则远比你现在用以运作的实质法则限制更少。换言之，你必须学着了解并运用新的自由。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Even these experiences will vary, however, and even this state is a state of becoming, for many will continue into other physical lives. Some will exist and develop their abilities in different systems of reality altogether, and so for a time will remain in this “intermediary” state.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，即使这些经验也会因人而异，而且即使这种状态也还是一种变为的状态，因为许多人将继续进入其他的物质生活。有些人将在全然不同的系统中生存和发展他们的能力，因而暂且留在这个“过渡”状态。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:35 to 10:48.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:35—10:48。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Mildly humorous): Now: For those of you who are lazy I can offer no hope: Death will not bring you an eternal resting place. You may rest, if this is your wish, for a while. Not only must you use your abilities after death, however, but you must face up to yourself for those that you did not use during your previous existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(略带幽默地：)对你们中间的那些懒人我无法提供任何希望：死亡不会带给你们一个永恒的休息所在。如果你希望的话，你可以休息一会儿。可是，死后不只必须用你的能力，而且为那些在你前一生中未加利用的能力，你还必须勇敢的面对自己。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Those of you who had faithin life after death will find it much easier to accustom yourself to the new conditions. Those of you who do not have such faithmay gain it in a different way, by following through in the exercises I will give you later in this book; for these will enable you to extend your perceptions to these other layers of reality if you are persistent, expectant, and determined.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那些对死后生命有信心的人，将发现自己更容易适应新的情况。至于那些没有这种信仰的人，也许可由一个不同的方式获得它，也就是照我在此书后面会给你们的练习去做；如果你是不懈的、有所期待的、有决心的。这些练习使你能将知觉扩展到实相的其他层面去。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now consciousness as you know it is used to these brief gaps of physical nonexistence mentioned earlier. Longer gaps disorient it to varying degrees, but these are not unusual. When the physical body sleeps, consciousness often leaves the physical system for fairly long periods, in your terms. But because the consciousness is not in the normally physically awake state, it is not aware of these gaps and is relatively unconcerned.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>其实，你所知的意识已习惯这些离开肉体的短暂空隙了。较长的空隙则会令它或多或少迷失方向，但这些并非不平常的。以你们的说法，当肉体入睡，意识常常离开物质系统相当长的时间。但因意识不是在正常的肉体醒时状态，它不察觉到这种空隙，而比较不担心。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:50.) If consciousness vacated the body for the same amount of time from a normally physically awake state, it would consider itself dead, for it could not rationalize the gap of dimension and experience. Therefore in the sleep state, each of you have undergone ---- to some degree ---- the same kind of absence of consciousness from physical reality that you experience during death.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:50)如果意识在正常的肉体醒时状态中撤出身体同样长的时间，它就会认为自己死了，因为它不能给次元和经验的空隙合理解释。因此在睡眠状态，你们每个人到某个程度都已经历过意识离开物质实相的情形，那与你在死亡时的经验是同一类的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In these cases, you return to the body, but you have passed over the threshold into these other existences many many times, so it will not be as unfamiliar to you as you may now suppose. Dream-recall experiments and othermental disciplines to be mentioned later will make these points quite clear to all of you who embark upon the suggested exercises.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在睡眠的例子里，你又回到了身体，但你已然踏过了进入这些其他存在的门槛许多许多次，因此这种情形并不会令你感到如你现在也许假设的那么不熟悉。以后我要谈的“梦之回想实验”，及其他的精神上的训练，会使所有做我所建议的练习的人对这些点都十分清楚。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, you may or may not be greeted by friends or relatives immediately following death. This is a personal matter, as always. Overall, you may be far more interested in people that you have known in past lives than those close to you in the present one, for example.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>且说在死后，你的朋友或亲人也许立即来欢迎你，也许不，这总是因人而异的。好比说，全盘来看，你也许对你在过去世所知的人，比对今生跟你亲近的人还要感兴趣得多。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:03.) Your true feeling toward relatives who are also dead will be known to you and to them. There is no hypocrisy. You do not pretend to love a parent who did little to earn your respect or love. Telepathy operates without distortion in this after-death period, so you must deal with the true relationships that exist between yourself and all relatives and friends who await you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:03)你对已死亡亲人的真正感情瞒不了你也瞒不了他们。没有虚伪。你不会假装爱一个没做什么来赢取你敬爱的父亲或母亲。在这死后期间，心电感应毫无扭曲地运作，因此你必须处理存在于自己与所有在等着你的亲友间的真正关系。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may find that someone you considered merely an enemy actually deserved your love and respect, for example, and you will then treat him accordingly. Your own motives will be crystal clear. You will react to this clearness, however, in your own way. You will not be automatically wise if you were not so before, but neither will there be a way to hide from your own feelings, emotions, or motives. Whether or not you accept inferior motives in yourself or learn from them is still up to you. The opportunities for growth and development are very rich, however, and the learning methods at your disposal very effective.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>举例来说，你可能会发现，某个你只当是敌人的人实际上值得你敬爱，那么你便随之那样对待他。你自己的动机将会明净如水晶。不过，你会以自己的方式对这明净起反应。如果你以前不聪明，你并不会自动地变聪明，但同时你也无法躲避自己的感觉、情感或动机。你是否接受自己心中较低级的动机或从它们之中学习，仍是看自己如何决定。不过，成长与发展的机会是非常丰富的，而且任你采用的学习方法也都非常的有效。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You examine the fabric of the existence you have left, and you learn to understand how your experiences were the result of your own thoughts and feelings and how these affected others. Until this examination is through, you are not yet aware of the larger portions of your own identity. When you realize the significance and meaning of the life you have just left, then you are ready for conscious knowledge of your other existences.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你审查你已离开的那一生的质地，而你学着去了解你的经验如何是自己思想与情感的结果，而这些又如何影响他人。你还没知觉到自己本体的较大部分，直到这审查完毕之后。当你领悟到你刚才离开的一生的意义和重要性，那时你才准备好去有意识的知觉到你的其他存在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You become aware, then, of an expanded awareness. What you are begins to include what you have been in other lives, and you begin to make plans for your next physical existence, if you decide upon one. You can instead enter another level of reality, and then return to a physical existence if you choose.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那时，你才变得知觉到一个开展的觉知。“你是什么”开始包括了你在其他的过去世中曾是什么，而你开始为下一次的肉体生活做计划，如果你决定要再去一次的话。反过来你也可以进入另一个层面的实相，然后再回到一次肉身生活，如果你这样选择的话。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:15.) Now this is the end of dictation. You may ask me questions or end the session as you prefer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:15)现在这是口述的结束。你可以问我问题或结束此节，随你便。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I was ready with questions about painting, so the session didn’t end until 11:26 P.M.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我准备了有关绘画的问题，因此这课直到11:26才结束。)</a>
