(星期一没上课，因为珍需要休息。今晚的课开始前她也非常想打瞌睡与放松，但她要上课。不过，一旦她开始为赛斯说话，她的态度就变得相当活泼了，她的声音也变得非常清晰而精确，而稍微有点大声。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(No session was held Monday, since Jane needed to rest. She was very sleepy and relaxed before the session this evening also, but she wanted to hold it. Once she began speaking for Seth, however, her manner turned fairly active; her voice became very clear and precise, and slightly loud.)</details>
晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Good evening.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
好，我们继续口述，开始下一章，称为〈交替的“现在”(Alternate Pressents)与多重焦点〉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: We will resume dictation, and begin our next chapter to be called: “Alternate Presents and Multiple Focus.”</details>
让我们以你所知的正常醒时意识开始。离这只一步之遥，就是你们全都曾不知不觉地滑进去过的一个意识层面，我们将称之为“A-1”。它邻接于你们的正常意识，与它微微地分开；但在其中却可出现非常明确的效果，那在你的通常状态是不存在的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Let us begin with the normal waking consciousness that you know. But one step away from this is another level of consciousness into which you all slip without knowing. We will call it “A-l.” It is adjacent to your normal consciousness, separated from it very slightly; and yet in it very definite effects can appear that are not present in your usual state.</details>
拿你已熟悉的物质资料为基础，许多能力在这层面可被利用，而且目前这一刻也可以用许多不同的方式体验。在你的正常状况你看见肉体。在“A-1”，你的意识能进入别人的肉体而治愈它。你也可以用同样的方式感知你自己肉体形相的状况。按照你的能力，你可以清澄而警醒地，有意识地由内部操纵外面的物质。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>At this level many abilities may be used, and the present moment can be experienced in many different fashions, using as a basis the physical data with which you are already familiar. In your normal state you see the body. In A-l your consciousness can enter the body of another, and heal it. You can in the same manner perceive the state of your own physical image. You can, according to your abilities, manipulate matter from the inside consciously, with lucidity and alertness.</details>
“A-1”可以被用为一个侧台，可以这么说，由那儿你能由一较清明的立足点来看实际的事件。当你在用它时，你可以暂时免受身体上的压力，而用那自由，你又可以再去减轻身体上的压力。似乎不可解决的难题常常——却非一定——能解决。在此时你给自己的建议有效得多。并且你较容易形成形相，而它们也有更强的活动性。因此，“A-1”只有一侧步之遥，却是重要的一步。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>A-1 may be used as a side platform, so to speak, from which you can view physical events from a clearer standpoint. Using it you are released momentarily from bodily pressures, and with that freedom, you can move to relieve them. Problems that seem beyond solution can often, though not always, be solved. Suggestions given are much more effective. It is easier to form images, and they have a greater mobility. A-1 is a sidestep away, therefore, and yet an important one.</details>
(在9:33停顿。珍已发现她很能应用“A-1”作为一个“侧台”。对她这是个很自然的方法。如她所说：“在我脸颊右边就有个小人形，我可以派这小小的我到各处去，也可以叫她做事。”当别人要求她时，她曾经以这小型的自己进入别人的身体，去检查各种的疾病、它们的原因等等。尝试我自己在这方面的技巧，我曾经可以进入譬如说珍的膝盖里去。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pause at 9:33. Jane has already discovered that she has very good abilities using A-1 as a “side platform.” This is a natural method for her. As she puts it: “Just off to the right of my cheek there’s this little figure, this tiny little me that I can send places and do things with.” When requested to, she has been able to enter the bodies of others with this miniature self, to check on various maladies, their causes, etc. Trying my own version of this technique, I have been able to enter Jane’s knee for instance.</details>
(在我为珍描述第十章第570节之后——该记住是赛斯建议我如此做——珍对这些可能性的兴趣开始增长。一周后派蒂来访，带来了她关于阿尔法状态的资讯，我的进展也因而加快了。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane’s interest in these possibilities began to grow after I described the 570th session in Chapter Seventeen to her ---- it will be remembered that Seth suggested I do this ---- and my progress was accelerated through Patty Middleton’s visit a week later, with her information about alpha states.)</details>
你可以把“A-1”当作一连串导向意识“更深”状态步骤的第一步，也可把它当作一连串邻接步骤的第一步。意识的每一个更深层面也可用作导向其邻接层面的第一步。“A-1”是很容易进入的，当你倾听你喜欢的音乐，当你沉醉于一种令人愉快的安静消遣，你就能感受到那不同的感觉。它也许由你自己身体上具有特征的线索伴随着，也许你以某种样子轻拉手指，也许有一种特定的手势，你可以瞪视或作梦般的向左或向右看。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now it can be used as the first of a series of steps, leading to “deeper” states of consciousness. It can also be used as the first of a series of adjacent steps. Each of the deeper layers of consciousness can also be used as first steps leading to other adjacent levels. A-l is simple to enter. When you listen to music that you like, when you are indulging in an enjoyable quiet pursuit, you can sense the different feeling. It may be accompanied by your own characteristic physical clues. You may tap your fingers in a certain way. There may be a particular gesture. You may stare or look dreamily to the left or right.</details>
这种身体上的线索的任何一个，都可以助你区分这种意识状态与平常主宰性的那种意识状态。你只需认知它，学着把握它，然后进一步实验运用它。一般而言它仍是肉体取向的，因为其能力通常是导向于内在的感知(inner perception)以及操纵物质或物理环境。因此你可以由平常所没有的各种独特立足点来感知“现在这一刻”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Any such physical clues can help you differentiate between this state of consciousness and the usual predominating one. You have only to recognize it, learn to hold it, and then proceed to experiment in its use. As a rule, it is still physically oriented, in that the abilities are usually directed toward the inner perception and manipulation of matter or physical environment. You can therefore perceive the present moment from a variety of unique standpoints not usually available.</details>
你可以感知你的肠子或你的手存在的此刻实相；经过练习，你也能体验在你肉体内同时存在的当下片刻的内在宁静与骚动。这使你生出无量的赞赏与惊叹，并且与组成你身体活生生的肉体物质有一种统一和谐的感觉。经过练习，你能变得直觉地觉察你的内在肉体环境，就与觉察外在物质环境一样。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You can perceive the moment’s reality as it exists for your intestine, or your hand; and experience, with practice, the present inner peace and commotion that exist simultaneously within your physical body. This brings a great appreciation and wonder, a sense of unity with the living corporeal material of which you are physically composed. With practice you can become as intuitively aware of your internal physical environment, as [of] your external physical environment.</details>
(在9:43停顿。)练习得更多，你自己心智的内容会变得唾手可得。你会看到你的思想像你的内脏一样清楚。在这情况，你可以透过你会认知的象征，而象征性地感知你的思想，例如看见混乱的思想像一堆杂草，你于是就可以将之丢弃。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pause at 9:43.) With greater practice, the contents of your own mind will become as readily available. You will see your thoughts as clearly as your inner organs. In this case you may perceive them symbolically through symbols you will recognize, seeing jumbled thoughts for example as weeds, which you can then simply discard.</details>
你能要求你心中思想的内容被转译为一个强烈的形象，象征性地代表个人的思维与整个的精神景致，然后取出你不喜欢的而以更积极的形象取代。这并不表示内心景致必得永远全是阳光普照，但确指它应是很平静的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You can request that the thought content of your mind be translated into an intense image, symbolically representing individual thoughts and the overallmental landscape, then take out what you do not like and replace it with more positive images. This does not mean that this inner landscape must always be completely sunny, but it does mean that it should be well balanced.</details>
一个黑暗而抑郁的内心景致应使你警觉，使你立即着手改变它。以上这些成就都不是我的读者所做不到的，虽则任一个人可能发现任一特定的伟绩要比另一个更难些。你也必须了解我是以实际的方式说话。例如，以刚才所示的方法，你能改正一个身体上的情况。不过，如果事情如我所说，那么借着检查思想的内在景致，你在此便可发现起先导致肉体疾病的来源。(停顿。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>A dark and largely brooding inner landscape should alert you, so that you begin immediately to change it. None of these accomplishments are beyond my readers, though anyone may find any one given feat more difficult than another. You must also realize that I am speaking in practical terms. You can correct a physical condition for example, in the manner just given. If so, however, by examining the inner landscape of thoughts, you would find the source here that initially brought about the physical ailment. (Pause.)</details>
情感和感受也可以同样方式来审查。它们看起来不同，流动性要大许多。例如，思想可能以固定不动的结构，如花或树、房子或风景出现，感受则会更常出现在水、风、气候、天空等的流动变化和色彩的改变里。那么，借由向内看进身体，任何肉体疾病在“A-1”这状态里会被感知而发现；然后借由改变你所见，你可能发现自己进入你的或别人的身体，像一个很小的人，或像一点光，或根本没有任何实体，却知觉到内在的身体环境。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Feelings can be examined in the same way. They will appear differently, with much greater mobility. Thoughts, for example, may appear as stationary structures, as flowers or trees, houses or landscapes. feelings will appear more often in the changing mobility of water, wind, weather, skies and changing color. Any physical ailment, then, can be perceived in this state by looking inward into the body and discovering it; then by changing what you see you may find yourself entering your body or another’s as a very small miniature, or as a point of light, or simply without any substance, yet aware of the inner body environment.</details>
(9:54)那么，以你想到的不论什么方式去改变任何需要改变的地方——借着把身体的能量导向那个方向，借着进入那肉体而把需要调整的某些部分整顿一下，借着推拿脊椎的某一段等等。然后由这“A-1”意识的邻接台，以你认为是你特性的不论什么方式，感知你自己或他人的抽象思想模式。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:54.) You change what needs to be changed in whatever way occurs to you, then ---- by directing the body’s energy in that direction, by entering the flesh and bringing certain portions together that need this adjustment, by manipulating areas of the spine. Then from this adjacent platform of A-l consciousness, you perceive themental thought patterns of yourself or the other person in whatever way you find characteristic of you.</details>
也许你感知思想的模式，好像常在你或别人心中看到快速闪现的句子或文字，或像印成文字的黑色字母。或许你听见那些字或思想被表达出来，或你看见先前提及的“景致”，在其中思想象征性地形成了一个画面。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may perceive the thought patterns as quickly flashing sentences or words that are usually seen within your mind or within the other mind, or as black letters that form words. Or you may hear the words and thoughts being expressed, or you may see the earlier mentioned “landscape” in which the thoughts symbolically form into a picture.</details>
这将显示给你思想怎样引起身体上的疾病，以及涉及了哪些思想。然后应该对“情感模式”做同样的事。这可被感知为猝发的、在变动的暗色或明色，或仅只感觉到一特定的强烈情感。如果它很强烈，一种情感能以多种这样的扮相被感受到。在思想与情感这两个例子里，你都以极大的信心摘除那些与疾病相连的。这样子，你在思想、情感和肉体三个层面都做了调整。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This will show you how the thoughts brought about the physical malady, and which ones were involved. The same thing should then be done with the feeling pattern. This may be perceived as bursts of dark or light colors in motion, or simply one particular emotion of great force may be felt. If it is very strong, one emotion may be felt in many such guises. In the case of both thoughts and feelings, with great confidence you pluck out those that are connected with the malady. In such a manner you have made adjustments on three levels.</details>
“A-1”也可以被用作创造、贯注、研究、消遣、休息与冥想的一个伟大架构。你可以发展出你自己在这个状态的一个影像来帮助你，把它想象作一个房间或一个令人愉快的景致或平台。自然而然地，你就会为你的“A-1”状态找到自己的象征。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>A-1 may be used also as a great framework for creativity, concentration, study, refreshment, rest and meditation. You may evolve your own image of this state to help you, imagining it as a room or a pleasant landscape or platform. Spontaneously, you will find your own symbol for this state.</details>
你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break.</details>
(10:02。珍的出神状态很深，而我写字的手可证实她讲话的快速。她说，尽管她在课要开始前一直打瞌睡，她却“澄明清澈的感觉到赛斯的存在”。她的确说得格外清楚，同时还知觉到赛斯正在说的话，通常并非如此。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:02. Jane’s trance had been deep, and my writing hand could attest to her fast delivery. In spite of being sleepy just before the session, she said, she had “felt Seth as clear as a bell.” She had indeed spoken with an extra clarity. She’d also been aware of what Seth was saying, which usually isn’t the case.</details>
(这资料是赛斯以一种原创性的方式发展一个概念的又一个例子。最初我奇怪他的“A-1”状态是否只是重复派蒂给我们的阿尔法资料，但很快地显示出他只是用阿尔法作一个起飞点。他已然大大的超越了它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(This material was another instance of how Seth developed an idea in an original way. At first I wondered whether his A-1 state would merely repeat the alpha data given to us by Patty Middleton, but it soon developed that he was using alpha only as a takeoff point. Already he was well beyond it.</details>
(在10:21以同样的快速方式继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Resume in the same fast manner at 10:21.)</details>
好，这状态也可用作跨向意识的下个状态的一步，导向一个更深的出神状态；无论如何，却仍然与你了解的实相系统相关。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: This state may be used also as a step to the next state of consciousness, leading to a deeper trance condition; still relating however to the reality system that you understand.</details>
或者它可用作导向意识的一个邻接层面的一步；因此，离同一层面上的正常实相两步之遥。在这情形中，它不把你导入对“现在这一刻”更深的审视与感知，反之却进入一个我将称之为“交替的现在时刻”的觉察与认知。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Or it may be used as a step leading to an adjacent level of consciousness; two steps away, therefore, on the same level from normal reality. In this case it will lead you not into a deeper examination and perception of the present moment, but instead into an awareness and recognition of what I will call alternate present moments.</details>
你将离开你所知的现在。这导向了在本书之前提到过的探索，也就是进入了可能性。当你试想解决与将来的安排有关的问题、会影响到将来的决定、以及事实上在其中必须对将来做重要决定的任何事件，这种状态是极为有利的。在这状态，你能够尝试种种不同的决定与一些可能的结果，不是只去想象它，而是以相当实际的方式(停顿)。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You will be taking steps aside from the present that you know. This leads to explorations mentioned earlier in this book, into Probabilities. This state can be extremely advantageous when you are trying to solve problems having to do with future arrangements, decisions that will affect the future, and any matter, in fact, in which important decisions for the future must be made. In this state you are able to try out various alternative decisions and some probable results, not imaginatively but in quite practical terms. (Pause.)</details>
这些可能性就是实相，不管你作哪个决定。例如，就说你有三个选择而你必须选一个。你利用这个状态选了第一个选择。“交替的现在”是你作那选择的时刻。做了选择之后，这“现在”被改变了，而你十分清楚地感知到它改变的方式，以及由这改变，哪种行动与事件会流进属于那特定“交替的现在”的将来里。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>These Probabilities are realities, regardless of which decision you make. Say, for example, that you have three choices and it is imperative that you select one. Using this state, you take the first choice. The alternative present is the moment in which you make that choice. Having made it the present is changed, and quite clearly you perceive exactly the way it is changed and what actions and events will flow from the change into the future that belongs to that particular alternate present.</details>
(10:30)对这选择之外的其他每一个选择，你也做了同样的事，全都从那种意识状态的架构。在每个案子中，方法是相同的。你作了决定，然后你变得觉察到不论是哪个选择在你体内的实际效应。你以我先前谈到的自疗方式进入了你的肉体。以相当程度的敏锐，你能看到这决定会有什么样肉体上的影响——肉体的情况是否维持一样，在它之内是否有一种极健康的感觉，还是有些重大的毛病在开始萌芽了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:30.) You do the same with each of the other choices, all from the framework of that state of consciousness. The methods in each case are the same. You make the decision. You then become aware in whatever way you choose of the physical effects within your body. You enter the body as you did in the way I gave earlier for healing. With great sensitivity you are able to see what physical effect the decision will have ---- whether the state of the body remains the same, whether there is a great sense of health within it, or the incipient beginning of great difficulties.</details>
以相似的方式，你探索精神与情感方面，于是你把注意力转“向外”，朝向由这“交替的现在”所导致的环境。事件会出现在你脑海里，你可能很强烈地经历这些，或只是观看它们。它们可能变得如此生动令你一时忘了自己，但如果你维持与这意识层面的接触，这很少会发生。一般而言，你非常明白自己在做什么。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In like manner you explore themental and feeling aspects, then you turn your attention “outward,” toward the environment that results from this alternate present. Mentally, events will appear to you. You may experience these strongly, or merely view them. They may become so vivid that you momentarily forget yourself, but if you maintain your contact with this level of consciousness, this will happen seldom. As a rule you are very aware of what you are doing.</details>
按照当时的情况，你可用同样方式做，以发现这决定对其他人的个别影响。然后你回到正常意识，经过你用作开端的“A-1”状态。休息一会儿之后，回来作第二个决定，再作第三个，以此类推。当然，然后在你的正常意识状态，由你收到的资讯与经验再作你要的决定。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>According to the situation, you can do the same thing to find out the effect of this decision on others specifically. You then return to normal consciousness, going through the A-l state that you used as a preliminary. After a period of rest, return and make the second decision, and again the third, following through in the same manner. Then in your normal state of consciousness, of course, you make the decision that you want from the information and experience that you have received.</details>
(10:35)名称没多少关系。为简明起见且叫这意识层面为“A-1-a”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:36.) The names make little difference. For simplicity’s sake call this level of consciousness A-1-a.</details>
你明白吗，与此相类还有一个“A-1-b”，仍然由一个可用在许多其他目的的“交替的现在”开始。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There is an A-1-b, you see, still adjacent to this one, and still starting off from an alternate present that can be used for many other purposes.</details>
(停顿。)一般人不是那么容易进入“A-1-b”，而它所处理的是“群体的现在”、集体的可能性、种族事件、文明的动向。它对从政者与政治家会是最为有利的，它也一样可被用来探索可能的过去。此时它则对比如说获悉古老的废墟及消失了的文明有用，但只在这些资料存在于那特定的可能过去时才行得通。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pause.) It is not as easy for the ordinary individual to enter, and it deals with group presents, with mass Probabilities, racial matter, the movement of civilization. It is one that would be most beneficial to politicians and statesmen, and it also can be used to probe into probable pasts as well. Here it would be of benefit in learning of old ruins for example, and vanished civilizations, but only if the specific probable past were probed in which these existed.</details>
下一相邻的层面该是“A-1-c”了，这是刚才说的那个的延伸，在其中有更大的行动自由、机动与经验。在此，你对所感知的事件多少有些参与，超过此点不必要再深谈这些情况，因为一般而言你不会涉及它们，它们所导向的实相与你自己的甚少关联。它们是离得太远的意识状态，而在平常的状况下，这是你目前的意识在那特定方向所能走到最远地方。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next adjacent level now would be A-1-c, which is an extension of the one just given, in which there is greater freedom of action, mobility and experience. Here to some extent there is some participation in the events perceived. There is no need to go deeply into any of these beyond this point, because ordinarily you will not be involved with them, and they lead into realities that have little reference to your own. They are states of consciousness too divorced, and under usual circumstances, this is as far as your present consciousness is able to go in that particular direction.</details>
第一个状态“A-1-a”，对你是最实际最容易的，但通常在你愿意踏出邻接的下一步前，你必得对“A-1”有相当的了解和感受，不过，在它的限度之内，它容许很大的扩张。例如，利用它，你可发现如果“我做这个或那个”会发生何事。记着，这些全是邻接的层面，水平地向外推出。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The first state, A-1-a, is the most practical and the easiest for you, but often you must still have a good feeling for the A-1 level before you are willing to take that next adjacent step. It allows for great expansion, however, within its limitations. Using it, you can discover for example what would have happened if “I did this or the other.” Remember, these are all adjacent levels, going out horizontally.</details>
(10:47)现在，直接在“A-1”之下，你将有“A-2”，用到上下方的比喻，那是个稍微深一点的层面。它比“A-1”稍微不那么肉体取向。你仍极度的清醒与觉察。以你们的话来说，这状态可用以探索在你所知的可能系统之内的过去。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:47.) Directly beneath A-l, now, you will have A-2, which is a slightly deeper state, using the analogy of up and down direction. It is less physically oriented than A-l. You still have excellent lucidity and awareness. This state can be used to explore the past in your terms of reference, within the probable system that you know.</details>
在此你会知道转世的过去，如果某些个人的疾病不能由“A-1”解决，你也许必须进入“A-2”去发现它在过去世的来源。这状态由一较缓的呼吸模式而明白的显示出来，并且还有——除非给了别的指示——多少稍低的体温与较长的阿尔法波；一种较慢的频率。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>reincarnational pasts are known to you here, and if some personal malady cannot be solved from A-1, you may have to go to A-2 discovering that it originated from another existence. This state is distinguished by a slower breathing pattern and, unless other directions are given, by a somewhat lowered temperature and longer alpha waves; a slower frequency.</details>
不过，此时你与环境仍有关，并对它有知觉。为了更大的效率，这可以被挡掉，但不是必要的。例如，在许多案例里眼睛可以睁开，虽然闭着也许容易些。此地感受性加速，不必一定得遵循“A-1”所给的方法，而“过去的你”的精神面、肉体面与情感面都会出现。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There is still relation to environment, however, and awareness of it. This may be purposely blocked off for greater efficiency, but it is not necessary. In many cases the eyes may be open, for example, though it may be easier to close them. Here sensitivity is quickened. Without necessarily following the methods given in A-1, the mental, physical and feeling aspects of past personalities will appear.</details>
(10:55)依照在这状况的此人特性，它们可以不同的方式被感知到。这可用来发现一个观念过去的渊源，或找到遗落在那儿的任何东西，只要它是在你的可能系统之内。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:55.) They may be perceived in various ways according to the characteristics of the individual who is in this state. This can be used to discover the origin of an idea in the past, or to find anything that has been lost there, as long as it is within your probability system.</details>
直接位于其下的是“A-3”。你在这儿又有一个延伸，是与群体问题有关的——地壳的变动，你所知的你们行星的历史，对居住其上的种族的知识、动物的历史、天然气与煤层，以及扫过这行星而改变了它的各个时代。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Directly beneath this is A-3. You have an extension, again, here dealing with mass issues ---- movements of land, the history of your planet as you know it, the knowledge of the races that inhabited it, the history of the animals, the layers of gas and coal, and of the various ages that swept across the planet and changed it.</details>
你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break.</details>
(10:59。珍的出神状态又是非常好。她曾体验到许多形象，但现在无法诉诸语言。我写字的手瘫了，因此之故我们没继续，纵使我极想继续。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:59 P.M. Jane’s trance had again been very good. She had experienced many images, but couldn’t put them into words now. My writing hand was lame; because of this we didn’t resume the session, much as I wanted to.</details>
(珍说，赛斯心中已有了其他的“方向”，涉及到右与左；虽然他还没借比喻而大大深入这些地区，他却已都计划好了。她可以“看见”这些方向，它们是与可能性有关的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Seth, Jane said, already had other “directions” in mind, involving the right and left; although he hadn’t moved into these areas yet to any great degree via analogies, he had it all planned. She could “see” these directions. They had to do with Probabilities.</details>
(珍告诉我如果继续下去的话，赛斯本要说到派蒂·密豆顿上周的来访，是从1970年9月我们在费城结识她时就已萌芽了。赛斯知道当他进行到有关意识的种种阶段时，她极有可能会在此。这证实了我自己对她来访时间的猜测；见第十八章第573节前面的注。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane told me that had the session continued, Seth was going to say that Patty Middleton’s visit last week had been incipient from the time we met her in Philadelphia, in September, 1970. Seth knew there was a high probability that she would be here when he was working on the section of his book concerning stages of consciousness. This confirms my own speculations about the timing of her visit; see the notes prefacing the 573rd session in Chapter Eighteen.</details>
(这并不是说派蒂到这儿来是命定的。自由意志永远在运作。她只是“收到”(picked up)这是一个见我们的好时候的念头，而选择要作那次旅行。赛斯接着用她的关于阿尔法的资讯作为他自己谈“A-1”、”A-1-a”、”A-2”等资料的一个推动力。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(This isn’t to say that Patty’s journey here was preordained. Free will always operates. She simply “picked up” that this was a good time to see us, and chose to make the trip. Seth then used her information about alpha as an impetus for his own material on A-1, A-1-a, A-2, etc.)</details>
