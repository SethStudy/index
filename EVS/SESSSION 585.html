(在课开始前，珍和我看了一遍为第二十章所列的单子上余下的问题。她说：“我希望赛斯快点说论宗教和转世，把它们弄完了算了。”我们早已发现珍对那些主题很敏感，特别是宗教；她在年少时在那方面受过严格的训练。不过，与那相连的，她自个儿发展了一股很强的、真正的宗教倾向。她很明白这种早年的环境留下了它的记号，虽然她在十九岁时就已离开了她的教会……<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Before the session Jane and I went over the questions remaining on the list we had prepared for Chapter Twenty. “I hope Seth will just do those chapters on religion and reincarnation, and get them over with,” she said. We’ve realized for some time that Jane is sensitive to those subjects, particularly religion; she had strict training in that field as a youngster. Coupled with that, however, she developed a very strong, literal, religious drive on her own. She is well aware that such an early environment leaves its marks, even though she had left her church by the time she was nineteen….</details>
(多少令我惊讶地，赛斯今晚开始了第二十一章，但我不久便知道他并没把我们的问题留在后面不管。此节又是在我的画室里举行，因为地方相当小，珍决定不吸烟。今天下了一整天的雨，此时还在下。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Somewhat to my surprise Seth started Chapter Twenty-one this evening, but I soon realized that he wasn’t leaving our questions behind. The session was held in my studio again, and because of its rather small size Jane decided not to smoke. It had been raining all day, and still was.)</details>
晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Good evening.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
如我说过的，对宗教与转世的问题在适当的时机会得到答复。在本文进行中我也会处理你们几个其他的问题。因此我们开始下一章，叫作〈宗教的意义〉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: The questions on religion and reincarnation will be answered in due time, as mentioned. I will deal with several of your other questions also along with the text. Therefore we will begin the next chapter, called: “The Meaning of Religion.”</details>
在“全我”之内永远有内在的觉悟。每个人心内均理解“所有存在的意义”。对“多次元存在”的知识，不只是在你现在有意识活动的背后，而且每个人内心也知道，他有意识的生命是依赖着一个更大的确实次元。这更大的次元无法在一个三次元的系统里具体化，但对这更大次元的知识由“存在”的最深心处泛滥流出，向外投射，改变它所触及的一切。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There are internal realizations always present within the whole self. There is comprehension of the meaning of all existence within each personality. The knowledge of multidimensional existence is not only in the background of your present conscious activity, but each man knows within himself that his conscious life is dependent upon a greater dimension of actuality. This greater dimension cannot be materialized in a three-dimensional system, yet the knowledge of this greater dimension floods outward from the innermost heart of being, and is projected outward, transforming all it touches.</details>
这“泛滥流出”的知识以一种非比寻常的光辉与强度，浸染了物质世界的某些成份。以你们的话来说，那些被它触及的东西，会被转化成比原本更多的某个东西。这内在知识企图在物质景观之内为它自己找个安身之处，把它自己转译为具体的方式。那么，每个人在他自身内都拥有这内在知识，并且以某种方式，他也寻求在世上证实它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This flooding-out imbues certain elements of the physical world with a brilliance and intensity far surpassing that usually known. Those touched by it are transformed, in your terms, into something more than they were. This inner knowledge attempts to find a place for itself within the physical landscape, to translate itself into physical terms. Each man, then, possesses this inner knowledge within himself, and to some extent or other he also looks for confirmation of it in the world.</details>
(在9:45停顿。附带地，以上的一段是对一九六三年九月，由珍自己心灵启发所流出的结果一个绝佳的小小描述。她的超越经验导致她的文稿——〈物质宇宙是意念建构而成〉，而随之又导致这些课。见她给本书的序言。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pause at 9:45. The above paragraph is, incidentally, an excellent little description of the results flowing from Jane’s own psychic initiation in September, 1963. Her transcendent experience led to her manuscript, The Physical Universe as idea construction, which in turn led to these sessions. See her Introduction to this book.</details>
(一个小记：现在我看见珍在出神状态中点了根烟，觉得很好玩。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(A note: I was amused, now, to see Jane light a cigarette while she was in trance.)</details>
外在世界是内在世界的反映，虽然绝非完美的反映。内在知识可比为关于家乡故土的一本书，被一个旅行者随身带到一个陌生的国度。每个人天生就有一种渴望，希望自己能“体证”这些真理，虽然他看到在这些真理与他所生活的环境间有很大的不同。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The outer world is a reflection of the inner one, though far from perfect. The inner knowledge can be compared to a book about a homeland that a traveler takes with him into a strange country. Each man is born with the yearning to make these truths real for himself, though he sees a great difference between them and the environment in which he lives.</details>
每个个人都在进行一出内在的戏剧，一出“心灵剧”。在某方面来说，这剧的本身是个心理现象，因为每个物质取向的自己都感觉被孤单地推入一个陌生的环境，不知它的来源或目的地，甚或它自己存在的理由。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>An internal drama is carried on by each individual, a psychic drama which is finally projected outward with great force upon the field of history. The birth of great religious events emerges from the interior religious drama. The drama itself is a psychological phenomenon in a way, for each physically oriented self feels thrust alone into a strange environment, without knowing its origins or destination or even the reason for its own existence.</details>
这是“自我”的两难之局，尤其是在它的早期状态。它向外找寻答案，因为这是它的天性：在物质实相之内操纵。可是，它也感觉到，它与不在它辖治之内的自己其他部分有一种深刻而历久不渝的联系，那是它所不了解的。它也觉知这“内我”拥有它自己的存在建立于其上的知识。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This is the dilemma of the ego, particularly in its early states. It looks outward for answers because this is its nature: to manipulate within physical reality. It also senses, however, a deep and abiding connection that it does not understand, with other portions of the self that are not under its domain. It is also aware that this inner self possesses knowledge upon which its own existence is based.</details>
以你们的话来说，当它长大时，它向外求证这内在知识的存在。“内我”以它的支持来扶持“自我”。它将它的真理形成“自我”能处理的物质取向的资料，然后把这些向外投射进入物质实相的范围。“自我”看到这些真理如此被具体化后，发现自己较易接受它们。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>As it grows, in your terms, it looks outward for confirmation of this inner knowledge. The inner self upholds the ego with its support. It forms its truths into physically oriented data with which the ego can deal. It then projects these outward into the area of physical reality. Seeing these truths thus materialized, the ego then finds it easier to accept them.</details>
如此，你们常碰到一些事件，在其中人被伟大的启迪所触及，与人类的群体隔绝而被赋予极大的力量——一些历史时代与其他的相比之下显得几乎灿烂得超乎自然；先知、天才与帝王，以比人类伟大的比例显现出来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Thus you deal often with events in which men are touched by great illumination, isolated from the masses of humanity, and endowed with great powers ---- periods of history that appear almost unnaturally brilliant in contrast with others; prophets, geniuses, and kings shown in greater-than-human proportion.</details>
(10:00)其实这些人被其他的人选了出来，以向外显示所有人直觉知晓的内在真理。这儿有许多层次的重要性。在一方面来说，这种个人由同伴那儿收到他们的超自然能力与力量，容纳它并在物质世界展示它给所有的人看。他们扮演那受祝福的“内我”角色。没有肉体的“外衣”，那“内我”实际上无法在物质实相里运作。不过，这能量是由“内我”而来的十分有效的投射。(停顿良久。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:00.) Now these people are chosen by others to manifest outwardly the interior truths that all intuitively know. There are many levels of significance here. On the one hand, such individuals receive their unearthly abilities and power from their fellows, contain it, exhibit it in the physical world for all to see. They play the part of the blessed inner self that actually cannot operate within physical reality uncloaked by flesh. This energy, however, is a quite valid projection from the interior self. (Long pause.)</details>
于是被它这样触及的人，以某种说法，实际上的确变成了他似乎是的人物。他在外在的宗教剧里以一个不朽的英雄身份份出现，就如“内我”是内在宗教剧的不朽英雄。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The personality so touched by it actually does then become, in certain terms, what he seems to be. He will emerge as an eternal hero in the external religious drama, as the inner self is the eternal hero of the interior religious drama.</details>
(10:08)这种神秘的投射是个持续不断的活动。当一个伟大宗教的力量开始减弱，而其实际的效果越来越少时，那时内在的戏剧再度加速。因此，人类最高的渴望又将投射到人间的历史上。这些戏的本身会有所不同，因为你要记住，它们首先是内在建立起来的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:08.) This mystic projection is a continual activity. When the strength of one great religion begins to diminish and its physical effects grow less, then the internal drama begins once again to quicken. The highest of man’s aspirations, therefore, will be projected upon physical history. The dramas themselves will differ. Remember, they are built up internally first.</details>
这些戏会被形成，以对任一既定时刻的世界情况产生影响，因此它们是以最能给民众印象的象征与事件来表达的。“内我”很巧妙地做到这个，因为它精确地知道什么能给“自我”深刻的印象，以及哪种人格最能充当在任一既定时间的信息之化身。那么，当这样一个人出现在历史上，他就被直觉地认出来，因为路早已铺好了，而在许多例子里，宣告这样一个来临的预言也早已给了人了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They will be formed to impress world conditions at any given time, and therefore couched in symbols and events that will most impress the populace. This is craftily done, for the inner self knows exactly what will impress the ego, and what kinds of personalities will be best able to personify the message at any given time. When such a personality appears in history then, he is intuitively recognized, for the way has long been laid, and in many cases the prophecies announcing such an arrival have already been given.</details>
这样子被选的人并不是恰巧出现在你们中间，他们不是随便被选的。他们是自愿承担起扮演这角色责任的人。在他们出生后，对他们的命运有或多或少的觉知，而某些触发性的经验有时可能会唤醒他们完全的记忆。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The individuals so chosen do not just happen to appear among you. They are not chosen at random. They are individuals who have taken upon themselves the responsibility for this role. After their birth they are aware to varying degrees of their destiny, and certain trigger experiences may at times arouse their full memory.</details>
他们十分清楚地是在充当“一切万有”的人类代表。既然每个人是“一切万有”的一部分，你们每个人也都多少充作那同样的角色。但是在这样一个宗教剧里(停顿良久)，那位主角对他的内在知识要有意识得多，对他的能力更为觉知、更能利用，并且极为喜悦地熟知他与所有生命的关系。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They serve quite clearly as human representatives of All That Is. Now since each individual is a part of All That Is, to some extent each of you serve in that same role. In such a religious drama however (long pause), the main personality is much more conscious of his inner knowledge, more aware of his abilities, far better able to use them, and exultantly familiar with his relationship to all of life.</details>
现在你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take your break.</details>
(10:25。在休息之后，赛斯—珍传述了五页极佳的资料，有关我的绘画与相关的题目。此节在十一点三分结束。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:25. Following break, Seth-Jane delivered five excellent pages of data about my painting and related subjects. The session ended at 11:03 P.M.</details>
(珍知道赛斯已开始了他谈宗教的一章后，松了一口气同时又非常好奇。我最后给了她这资料的一个副本，以回答她所有的问题。她这么喜欢它以致把它念给了ESP班听，她对此书的一些先前的段落也这样做过。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane, knowing Seth had started his chapter on religion, was both relieved and very curious. I finally ended up giving her a copy of the material, in order to answer all of her questions. She liked it so much that she read it to ESP class, as she has done with a few previous segments from the book.)</details>
