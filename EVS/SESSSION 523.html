我们将结束第四章。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We will finish Chapter Four.</details>
(“好的”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“All right.”)</details>
现在：我花了些时间强调我们每个人都形成自己的环境这个事实，因为我要你们了解，你的生活与环境是自己的责任。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: I have spent some time emphasizing the fact that each of us forms our own environment, because I want you to realize that the responsibility for your life and your environment is your own.</details>
如果你相信并非如此，那么你便是受到限制的人；你的环境于是代表了你的知识与经验的总和。只要你相信你的环境是客观并独立于你自己之外的，那么，到一个很大的程度你会感到无力去改变它、超越它，或去想象也许比较不明确的其他选择余地，在此书的后面我将解释各种让你彻底改善你的环境的方法。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>If you believe otherwise, then you are limited; your environment then represents the sum total of knowledge and experience. As long as you believe your environment to be objective and independent of yourself, then to a large extent you feel powerless to change it, to see beyond it, or to imagine other alternatives that may be less apparent. Later in the book I will explain various methods that will allow you to change your environment beneficially and drastically.</details>
(9:23。注意上段第一句的分号。赛斯要求我就那样标点。在口述此书时，他常作此类要求。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:23. Note the semicolon in the first sentence of the above paragraph. Seth requested that I punctuate the sentence just that way. He made such requests often while dictating this book.)</details>
我也曾就环境来讨论转世的事，因为许多思想学派过分强调转世的影响，以致他们常把现世环境解释为在“前”生所决定的不变、不可妥协的模式之后果。如果你感到你受环境左右而无法加以控制的话，你会觉得较无能力去应付目前的物质实相，去改变你的环境，去影响与改变你的世界。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I have also discussed reincarnation in terms of environment because many schools of thought over-emphasize the effects of reincarnational existences, so that often they explain present-life circumstances as a result of rigid and uncompromising patterns determined in a “past” life. You will feel relatively incompetent to handle present physical reality, to alter your environment, to affect and change your world, if you feel that you are at the mercy of conditions over which you have no control.</details>
这些抑制的理由终究是无关紧要的，因为理由会随着时间与你的文化而变。你并不因原罪或任何童年事件或前生经验而被判了刑。举例来说，你的生活也许远比你以为你所愿望的要令你不满足。当你希望你是更伟大时也许你是更渺小，但你的心灵上并没被“原罪”或弗洛伊德的“婴儿症候群”或“前生影响”的阴影所笼罩。在这儿我要试着把前生影响解释得清楚一些。它们就像任何经验一样地影响你。不过，时间并不是关闭的——它是开放的。一次人生并没被埋葬在过去，而与现在的自身和将来的自身不相关连。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The reasons given for such subjugations matter little in the long run, for the reasons change with the times and with your culture. You are not under a sentence placed upon you for original sin, by any childhood events, or by Past-life experience. Your life, for example, may be far less fulfilling than you think you would prefer. You may be less when you would be more, but you are not under a pall placed upon your psyche, either by original sin, Freud’s infancy syndromes, or Past-life influences. I will try to explain the Past-life influences a bit more clearly here. They affect you as any experience does. Time is not closed, however ---- it is open. One life is not buried in the past, disconnected from the present self and any future self as well.</details>
(在这段珍的速度相当的慢。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(In this delivery Jane’s pace was relatively slow.)</details>
如我先前解释过的，这些生生世世或这些戏剧是同时发生的。创造与意识从不是线型的成就。在每一生中你选择与创造自己的背景或环境；在此生你选择你的父母与来到你经验之内的任何童年事件。你写剧本。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>As I explained earlier, the lives or the plays are happening at once. Creativity and consciousness are never linear achievements. In each life you choose and create your own settings or environments; and in this one you chose your parents and whatever childhood incidents that came within your experience. You wrote the script.</details>
(9:35。)不过，正像一个真的是心不在焉的教授，有意识的自己把这些全忘了。因此当剧本中出现了悲剧、困难或挑战，有意识的自己就怨天尤人。在此书完成之前，我希望指给你们看你们如何精确地创造了你经验的每一分钟，因此你才能开始在有意识——或几乎如此——的层面来负起你真正的创造责任。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:35.) Like a true absent-minded professor, the conscious self forgets all this, however, so when tragedy appears in the script, difficulty or challenges, the conscious self looks for someone or something to blame. Before this book is done I hope to show you precisely how you create each minute of your experience so that you can begin to exert your true creative responsibility on a conscious level ---- or nearly so.</details>
当你读这本书的时候，不时看看你坐在里面的房间。椅子、桌子、天花板与地板可能看来非常真实与坚固——相当具永久性——同时在对比之下你觉得自己极为脆弱，被困于出生与灭绝之间的片刻。当你想象物质宇宙在你走后还会久存，也许你还会感到嫉妒。但是，在此书结束时，我希望你领悟到自己意识的永恒效力(validity)，以及现在看来那么安然的你的环境、你的宇宙的那些物质面的非永恒性。你写下来了吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>As you read this book, now and then look about you at the room in which you sit. Chairs and tables, the ceilings and the floors, may seem very real and solid ---- quite permanent ---- while you by contrast may feel yourself to be highly vulnerable, caught in a moment between birth and extinction. You may even feel jealous when you think of it, imagining that the physical universe will continue to exist long after you are gone. By the end of our book, however, I hope you will realize the eternal validity of your own consciousness, and the impermanence of those physical aspects of your environment, and of your universe, that now seem so secure. Do you have that?</details>
(“是的”。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Yes.”)</details>
那就是第四章的结尾。可以休息一下。(9:44—10:02。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>That is the end of Chapter Four. You may take your break. (9:44 to 10:02.)</details>
第五章 思想如何形成物质——交会点<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>CHAPTER 5 HOW THOUGHTS FORM MATTER ? COORDINATION POINTS</details>
给我们几分钟。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Give us a moment.</details>
(随着有两分钟的停顿，到10:04止。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(A two-minute pause followed, ending at 10:04.)</details>
第五章：在你读本页上的字时，你悟到你在接受的资料并不属于字句本身。印刷出来的文字并不包含资料，而是转达资料。如果资料不是在纸页上，那这被转达的资料又是在何处？(停顿。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Chapter Five: As you read the words upon this page, you realize that the information that you are receiving is not an attribute of the letters of the words themselves. The printed line does not contain information. It transmits information. Where is the information that is being transmitted then, if it is not upon the page? (Pause.)</details>
当你看报，或与别人谈话时，同样的问题也适用。你们用实际的字句转达资料、情感或思想，但显然思想或情感与字句并非同一样东西。纸上的字是象征符号，而你们同意与它们相连的种种意义。你们想都不想地把以下事实视为当然：象征符号并非实相，而字句也不是它们试图转达的资料或思想。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The same question of course applies when you read a newspaper, and when you speak to another person. Your actual words convey information, feelings, or thoughts. Obviously the thoughts or the feelings, and the words, are not the same thing. The letters upon the page are symbols, and you have agreed upon various meanings connected with them. You take it for granted without even thinking of it that the symbols ---- the letters ---- are not the reality ---- the information or thoughts ---- which they attempt to convey.</details>
现在同样地我告诉你，物体(objects)也是象征符号，像字句一样，转达一个实相的意义。真正的资料并不在物体内，就像思想也不在字句内。字句是表达的方法。同样的实质物体也是另一种表达媒介。你习惯于借语言直接表达自己这个概念，你能听见自己说出它，你能感觉你喉头的肌肉在动，而如果你有觉察力，你能感知在自己体内的众多反应——那些伴随着你言语的所有活动。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now in the same way, I am telling you that objects are also symbols that stand for a reality whose meaning the objects, like the letters, transmit. The true information is not in the objects any more than the thought is in the letters or in words. Words are methods of expression. So are physical objects in a different kind of medium. You are used to the idea that you express yourselves directly through words. You can hear yourself speak them. You can feel the muscles in your throat move, and if you are aware, you can perceive multitudinous reactions within your own body - actions that all accompany your speech.</details>
(10:29。)物体是另一种表达的结果。你的确像创造字句一样的创造了它们。我不是指你光用手或由制造过程来创造它们，我是说物体是你们人类进化的自然副产品，就像字句一样。但是，审查一下你对自己话语的认知。虽然你听到字句，并且认可它们是恰当的，虽然它们也许或多或少接近你想表达的感觉，它们却并非你的感觉，在你的思想与你对它的表达之间必然有一些差距。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:29.) Physical objects are the result of another kind of expression. You create them as surely as you create words. I do not mean that you create them with your hands alone, or through manufacture. I mean that objects are natural by-products of the evolution of your species, even as words are. Examine for a moment your knowledge of your own speech, however. Though you hear the words and recognize their appropriateness, and though they may more or less approximate an expression of your feeling, they are not your feeling, and there must be a gap between your thought and your expression of it.</details>
当你领悟，在你开始说一句话时，连你自己都不很知道将如何结束它，或甚至也不知你如何形成字句时，语言的熟悉性便开始消失。你自己并不有意识地知道你如何操纵庞大的符号金字塔，由其中精确选出你表达某一个想法所需的那些字眼。就那件事而论，你甚至不知你是如何思想的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The familiarity of speech begins to vanish when you realize that you, yourself, when you begin a sentence do not know precisely how you will end it, or even how you form the words. You do not consciously know how you manipulate a staggering pyramid of symbols, picking from them precisely those you need to express a given thought. For that matter, you do not know how you think.</details>
你不知你是如何把本页上的这些符号转译为思想，然后贮积起来，或把它们变成为自己所有。既然在意识的层面上，正常语言的结构极少为你所知，那么你也同样的不知觉你所做的更复杂工作——就如经常地创造你的物质环境做为一个沟通与表达的方法——就不足为奇了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You do not know how you translate these symbols upon this page into thoughts, and then store them, or make them your own. Since the mechanisms of normal speech are so little known to you on a conscious level, then it is not surprising that you are equally unaware of more complicated tasks that you also perform ---- such as the constant creation of your physical environment as a method of communication and expression.</details>
只有由这个观点，人们才能理解物质的真实本质。只有由理解这种思想与欲望的经常转译的本质——并没译为字句，而是成为物体——你才能领会你是真正超越情况、时间与环境的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is only from this viewpoint that the true nature of physical matter can be understood. It is only by comprehending the nature of this constant translation of thoughts and desires ---- not into words now, but into physical objects ---- that you can realize your true independence from circumstance, time, and environment.</details>
现在你可以休息。(微笑，在10:36。)一个附注：我很高兴……<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take a break. (Smile, at 10:36.) A note: I am very pleased….</details>
(“高兴什么，赛斯？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“At what, Seth?”)</details>
我很高兴这章起头起得好，因为我想我发现了一个比喻，一个能把读者由物质形相的人造束缚中解放出来的真实比喻。当读者把物质形相当作自己的一个表达方式时，他即会领悟自己的创造力。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am pleased with the beginning of my chapter, for I think I have hit upon an analogy, and a true one, that will release the reader from the artificial bondage of physical form. When he sees it as a method of his own expression, he will realize his own creativeness.</details>
(10:38。珍的出神状态很好，她的速度颇慢。她说在开始时的两分钟停顿，是因为她有意“不过问”赛斯将如何开始第五章。她也体会到如果她“只是坐在那儿”，赛斯自己可以做得来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:38. Jane’s trance had been good, her pace rather slow. She said the two-minute pause at the start of the delivery took place because she was consciously “hung up” over how Seth was going to begin Chapter Five. She also realized that if she “just sat there,” Seth would do okay on his own.</details>
(当赛斯说话时，珍有一大堆影像。她说，他对此章胸有成竹；而且，他把他的“物体用为沟通方法”的概念异常栩栩如生地“显示”给她。她却无法描写她看到的影像。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane had a lot of images while Seth was speaking. He had the idea for this chapter very clearly in mind, she said; and, with extraordinary vividness, he was “impressing” her with his idea of matter being used as a means of communication. Yet she couldn’t describe the images she had seen.</details>
(正在告诉我这点时，珍忽然记起在她说话的某一段时候，她似乎站在分隔我们的起居室与她书房长长的、高及天花板的书架旁，这距她在课中总在用的摇椅有六尺之远。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(While telling me this, Jane abruptly remembered that during part of the delivery she seemed to be standing beside the long, floor-to-ceiling bookcase that divides our living room from her workroom. This would be a distance of about six feet from the rocker she always uses for sessions.</details>
(现在，珍忽有一个“记忆”：她在书架的地带给了赛斯资料的一部分，以及她由一个不同的角度看起居室。她不记得她曾出体。她说：“那个记忆像个梦似地回来。”她也记不得更多了。例如，她不记得看见自己在摇椅里，或看到我坐在沙发上作笔录。她对她离开了身体而能看到自己替赛斯传递资料的想法大感兴奋。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane had a “memory,” now, of giving part of Seth’s data from the bookcase area, of seeing the living room from a different viewpoint. She didn’t remember going out of her body. “It came back like a dream,” she said. Nor could she remember any more about the episode. She didn’t remember seeing herself in her chair, for instance, nor did she see me as I sat on the couch taking notes. She was much intrigued by the idea of being out-of-body, and able to watch herself give material for Seth.</details>
(在10:56继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Resume at 10:56.)</details>
现在，很容易明白你把感觉转译为文字或身体的表情与手势，却不那么容易了解就如你把感觉转译为符号、符号变为文字一样，你也同样不费力地、无意识地形成你的肉体。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now, it is easy to see that you translate feelings into words or bodily expressions and gestures, but not quite as easy to realize that you form your physical body as effortlessly and unselfconsciously as you translate feelings into symbols that become words.</details>
(在11:01停顿很久。)你一定听过环境代表某一个人的个性的说法。我告诉你这不是象征性的真相，而是实际的真相。在纸页上的字只有墨与纸的实相。它们所传递的资料是不可见的。做为一个物体，此书本身只是纸与墨。它是资料的运送工具。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Long pause at 11:01.) You have heard the expression before, I am sure, that the environment expresses a particular individual’s personality. I am telling you that this is a literal and not symbolic truth. The letters upon the page have the reality only of ink and paper. The information they convey is invisible. As an object, this book itself is only paper and ink. It is a carrier of information.</details>
你也许可以争辩说书是人工印制的，而非已经印好、装订好而突然由鲁柏的头壳中蹦出。然后你必须借或买这本书，因此你可能想：“当然，我并没创造这书，有如我创造我的字句一样。”但在我们结束前，我们将会明白，基本上说，你们每个人创造了你们拿在手中的书，而你们整个的物理环境出自你们的内心(inner mind)，就好像语言出自你们的口一样自然，而就好像人形成自己的呼吸一样，他也同样不自觉地、同样自动地形成物体。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may perhaps argue that the book was manufactured physically, and did not suddenly erupt through Ruburt’s skull, already printed and bound. You in turn had to borrow or purchase the book, so you may think, “Surely, I did not create the book, as I created my words.” But before we are finished we will see that basically speaking, each of you create the book you hold in your hands, and that your entire physical environment comes as naturally out of your inner mind as words come out of your mouths, and that man forms physical objects as unselfconsciously and as automatically as he forms his own breath.</details>
