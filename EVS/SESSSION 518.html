<div style="display:inline">(珍休息了一个月左右。她只有两次正规的课——一次为了朋友，一次为我们私人——而只有一次为她每周的ESP班〔班上的课没有编号〕。珍在猜想这暂停对赛斯的书是否有影响。然而，在给了我一些对我的画很机敏的资料后，赛斯在9:33很平顺地继续此书的口述——就好像在2月21到3月18之间没有任何时间的流逝。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane has been taking something of a rest for the last month or so. She’s had but two regular sessions ---- one for friends, and a personal one for us ---- and only one for her weekly ESP class. [Class sessions aren’t numbered.] Occasionally Jane has wondered what effect, if any, the break would have on Seth’s book. However, after giving me some very astute data about my painting, Seth resumed book dictation very smoothly at 9:33 ---- just as though there hadn’t been any time lapse from February 11 to March 18.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(注：我想，借不时地记录下时间，来显示赛斯用多少时间来讲述某个分量的资料，会很有意思。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(A note: I thought it would be of interest to show, by periodically recording the time, how long Seth takes to deliver a certain amount of finished material for his book.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那么，请稍候片刻。我将给你第二章的终结，以及下一章的开始。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Give us a moment, then. I will give you the very last of Chapter Two, and begin the following chapter.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">自然，我的环境包括那些我与之接触的其他“人”。沟通、感知与环境几乎是不可分的。因此在对我们的环境的任何讨论中，我自己与我同事之间的通讯方式就是极为重要的了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>My environment includes, of course, those other personalities with whom I come in contact. Communication, perception, and environment can hardly be separated. Therefore the kind of communication that is carried on by myself and my associates is extremely important in any discussion of our environment.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在下一章中，我希望给你有关我们世界的一些简单概念，关于我们所涉及的工作、我们存在的次元、我们所看重的目的；最要紧的是，组成我们经验的那些我们关心的事。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In the following chapter I hope to give you an idea, quite simply, of our existence, the work in which we are involved, the dimension in which we exist, the purposes that we hold dear; and most of all, of those concerns that make up our experience.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">第三章 我的工作及它带我进入的那些实相次元</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>CHAPTER 3 MY WORK AND THOSE DIMENSIONS OF REALITY INTO WHICH IT TAKES ME</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:34。)像你们一样，我也有朋友，虽然我的朋友可能比较是长年老友。你们必须了解，我们以与你们十分不同的方式去体验自己的实相。我们知觉到你们所谓的我们“前生”的自己，那些在各种不同的其他的存在中我们所采取的“人格”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:43.) Now I have friends even as you do, though my friends may be of longer standing. You must understand that we experience our own reality in quite a different manner than you do. We are aware of what you would call our past selves, those personalities we have adopted in various other existences.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因为我们用心电感应，所以纵使是我们想要彼此隐瞒，也是很难的。我相信，你们一定觉得这似乎侵犯了隐私权，但我向你保证，即使是现在，你们的思想也是一无隐敝的，你的家人与朋友对它们都十分清楚——我再加一句：而且很不幸的，你的敌人对它们也一样清楚。你们只是不知道这事实而已。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Because we use telepathy we can hide little from each other, even if we wished to. This, I am sure, seems an invasion of privacy to you, and yet I assure you that even now none of your thoughts are hidden, but are known quite clearly to your family and friends ---- and I may add, unfortunately, to those you consider enemies as well. You are simply not aware of this fact.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这并不表示我们每个人对别人来说都像一本翻开的书那样一目了然。刚好相反。有这么一种叫精神礼节(mental etiquette)、精神风度的东西。我们对自己的思想比你们对自己的要明白得多。我们了解我们有选择思想的自由，我们以辨识力和技巧来选择它们。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This does not mean that each of us is like an open book to the other. Quite the contrary. There is such a thing asmental etiquette,mental manners. We are much more aware of our own thoughts than you are. We realize our freedom to choose our thoughts, and we choose them with some discrimination and finesse.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:49暂停。)在其他的存在中，经过“尝试错误法”，使我们很清楚思想的威力。我们已发现没有一个人能逃避心象(mental image)或情感的巨大创造力。这并不表示我们不是随兴而自发的，也不表示我们必须在一个与另一个思想间慎重考虑，担心其一可能是负面的或毁灭性的。以你们的话来说，我们已超越过那些了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 9:49.) The power of our thoughts has been made clear to us, through trial and error in other existences. We have discovered that no one can escape the vast creativity of the Mental image, or of emotion. This does not mean that we are not spontaneous, or that we must deliberate between one thought or another, in anxious concern that one might be negative or destructive. That, in your terms, is behind us.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，我们的心理结构的确表示，我们能以比你们所熟知的多得多的方式来沟通。例如，假设你遇见一个你久已忘怀的童年友人，现在你们也许没多少共同点，但你们得以老师与同学为题愉快地谈一个下午，而建立某种的融洽关系。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Our psychological structure does mean that we can communicate in far more various forms than those with which you are familiar, however. Pretend, for example, that you meet a childhood friend whom you have long forgotten. Now you may have little in common. Yet you may have a fine afternoon’s discussion centered about old teachers and classmates, and establish a certain rapport.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此，当我“遇见”另一人，我可能以某一特定前世的生活经验为基础，与他相处甚欢，即使在我的“现在”我们少有共同点。例如，我们可能在十四世纪做为完全不同的人而彼此相识，借讨论那些经验我们可能沟通得非常好，正如同你与你假设的童年朋友借回忆你们的过去而建立融洽的关系一样。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>So, when I “meet” another, I may be able to relate to him much better on the basis of a particular past life experience, even though in my “now” we have little in common. We may have known each other, for example, as entirely different people in the fourteenth century, and we may communicate very nicely by discussing those experiences, much as you and your hypothetical childhood friend established rapport by remembering your past.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，我们会很明白我们是我们自己——我们是多次元的“人”，在我们存在的某一层面曾共享多少是共同的环境。你将来会明白，这是个只适用于目前相当简单的比喻，因为过去、现在与未来并非真是以那种情形存在的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>We will be quite aware that we are ourselves, however ---- the multidimensional personalities who shared a more or less common environment at one level of our existence. As you will see, this analogy is a rather simple one that will do only for now, because past, present, and future do not really exist in those terms.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">但是，我们的经验并不包括你们所熟悉的时间分隔。我们有比你们多得多的朋友与同事，只因我们对现在暂称为“过去”转世中的形形色色联系是有知觉的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Our experience, however, does not include the time divisions with which you are familiar. We have far more friends and associates than you do, simply because we are aware of varying connections in what we call for now “past” incarnations.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:00。)因此，我们手头可以说当然拥有更多的知识。在你们来说，你们所能提及的任何时代，我们中都有某些人是由那儿来的，而在我们的记忆中带着在那特定一生中所获得的不可磨灭的经验。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:00.) We have of course therefore more knowledge at our fingertips, so to speak. There is no period of time, in your terms, that you can mention, but some of us have been from there, and carry within our memories the indelible experience that was gained in that particular context.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们不觉得有隐藏情感或思想的必要，因为到现在我们全都认清了所有意识与实相彼此合作的本质，以及我们在其中的角色。我们是精神振奋的(幽默地)灵，还能是别样的吗？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>We do not feel the need to hide our emotions or thoughts from others, because all of us by now well recognize the cooperative nature of all consciousness and reality, and our part in it. We are highly motivated. (Humorously): Could spirits be anything else?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“我猜不能。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“I guess not.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">只因为我们能充分指挥我们的精力，它并没被转移到冲突上去。我们并没有浪费它，而是为那些独特与个人性的目的去运用它，那是我们“心理经验”的基本部分。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Simply because we have at our command the full use of our energy, it is not diverted into conflicts. We do not fritter it away, but utilize it for those unique and individual purposes that are a basic part of our psychological experience.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">且说，每个全我(whole self)，或多次元人格，都有自己的目的、使命与创造性的努力，那是它自己最初而基本的部分，而且那也决定了那些使它永恒不朽并永远寻求的品质。我们终于能自由地在那些方向运用我们的精力了。我们面对许多十分艰巨的挑战，而我们了悟不仅是我们的目的本身很重要，并且在我们努力去追求它时，所发展的意外旁枝也很重要。在为我们的目的而工作时，我们体认到我们正在为别人劈荆斩棘地做开路先锋。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now, each whole self, or multidimensional personality, has its own purposes, missions, and creative endeavors that are initial and basic parts of itself and that determine those qualities that make it eternally valid and eternally seeking. We are finally free to utilize our energy in those directions. We face many challenges of quite momentous nature, and we realize that our purposes are not only important in themselves, but for the surprising offshoots that develop in our efforts to pursue them. In working for our purposes, we realize we are blazing trails that can also be used by others.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们也怀疑——至少我是——这些目的其本身将有我们从没悟到的意外结果、可惊的后果，而它们只会导向新的途径。体认到这点使我们能保持一点幽默感。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>We also suspect ---- certainly I do ---- that the purposes themselves will have surprising results, astounding consequences that we have never realized, and that they will merely lead to new avenues. Realizing this helps us keep a sense of humor.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:11。)当一个人生生死死了许多次，每死一次都期待着完全的灭绝，当他随之发现，存在仍然在继续的时候，那么就有了一种“神圣的喜剧”(divine comedy)的感觉。(译注：此处套用但丁《神曲》原名，语意双关而幽默。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:11.) When one has been born and has died many times, expecting extinction with each death, and when this experience is followed by the realization that existence still continues, then a sense of the divine comedy enters in.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们开始学到“游戏”的创造性喜悦。例如，我相信所有的创造与意识都是诞生自游戏的特性(quality of play)而非工作的特性，诞生于加快了的直觉自发性(quickened intuitional spontaneity)中，在我自己所有的存在中，及我所知的别人经验中，这都是不变的常态。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>We are beginning to learn the creative joy of play. I believe, for example, that all creativity and consciousness is born in the quality of play, as opposed to work, in the quickened intuitional spontaneity that I see as a constant through all my own existences, and in the experience of those I know.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">例如，我与你们的次元沟通，并不是靠我要到你们实相层面的意志，而是靠“想象”我自己到那儿。如果我以前就了解我现在知道的，则我所有的死亡都成了探险。在一方面来说，你们把人生看得太认真，但在另一方面，你们看“游戏般的生存”却不够认真。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I communicate with your dimension, for example, not by willing myself to your level of reality, but by imagining myself there. All of my deaths would have been adventures had I realized what I know now. On the one hand you take life too seriously, and on the other, you do not take playful existence seriously enough.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们享有一种极为随兴自然的游戏感。但我假设你会称之为负责的游戏。它确实是具有创造性的游戏。例如，我们拿我们意识的机动性来玩，看看一个人能把它送出去多“远”。我们经常对自己意识的产物及对我们能像跳房子似地跃过的实相次元感到惊奇。可能看起来我们在这种游戏中无益地运用我们的意识，但由另一方面来看，我们所造的通路仍继续存在，可供别人利用。我们用精神性的路标给任何来者留下信息。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>We enjoy a sense of play that is highly spontaneous, and yet I suppose you would call it responsible play. Certainly it is creative play. We play, for example, with the mobility of our consciousness, seeing how “far” one can send it. We are constantly surprised at the products of our own consciousness, of the dimensions of reality through which we can hopscotch. It might seem that we use our consciousness idly in such play, and yet again, the pathways we make continue to exist and can be used by others. We leave messages to any who come by,mental signposts.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我建议你们暂停。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I suggest your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:25。珍轻易地回了神。她以一般的声调平顺地传达资料，没有长久的中断。但她很惊奇地发现已经过了一小时。就她记忆所及，当她讲话时，并没有看到意象或幻相。10:35以较慢的步调继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:25. Jane was out of her trance easily. She had delivered the material smoothly and without long pauses, in an average voice. She was quite surprised to learn that an hour had passed, however. Jane had no images or visions, as far as she recalled, when dictating material. Resume at a slower pace at 10:35.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此我们可以是精神振奋的，但却都会用并且了解游戏的创造性用法，不但是达到目标与目的的一个方法，而且其本身就是一种惊人的、创造性的努力。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>We can be highly motivated therefore, and yet use and understand the creative use of play, both as a method of attaining our goals and purposes and as a surprising and creative endeavor in itself.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">且说，在我当老师的工作中，我神游到许多的存在次元，就好像巡回讲学的教授可以在不同的州或国家里发表演讲一样。不过，其相似点大致止于此，因为在我开始工作前，我必须建立一个初步的心理结构，并且要先学着认识我的学生，才能开始教学。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now, in my work as a teacher I travel into many dimensions of existence, even as a traveling professor might give lectures in various states or countries. Here, however, the resemblance ends, largely, since before I can begin to work I must set up preliminary psychological structures and learn to know my pupils before teaching can even begin.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(现在珍的传述慢了不少。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane’s delivery was quite a bit slower now.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">对我学生在其中运作的那特殊的实相系统，对他的思想体系，对有意义的象征，我都必须有一个透彻的认识。我必须准确地测定学生的人格稳定性。那人格的需要不能被忽略而必须加以考虑。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I must have a thorough knowledge of the particular system of reality in which my pupil operates, of his or her system of thought, of the symbols that are meaningful. The stability of the pupil’s personality must be correctly gauged by me. The needs of that personality cannot be ignored but must be taken into consideration.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">当学生在持续进展时，必须受到鼓励，但不得过分。我的教材必须以一种学生在了解实相的情况时所能明白的方式提出，尤其是在早期。即使在严肃的学习能开始之前，也必须非常小心的顾虑到此人格所有层面都多少以不变的速度发展。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The pupil must be encouraged, but not overly extended while development continues. My material must be presented in such a way that it makes sense in the context in which the pupil understands reality, particularly in the early stages. Great care must be utilized, even before serious learning can begin, that all levels of the personality develop at a more or less constant rate.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在最开始时，通常我会提出资料而不露任何我在场的迹象，看起来仿佛是令人惊愕的启示。因为不论我多小心的提出那资料，它仍然注定了会改变学生过去的观念，那本来是学生人格很坚固的一部分。不管我说的是什么，但学生自然会被推入心理与心灵的行为与经验，那在他有意识的层面看来似乎十分的陌生。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Often the material I present will initially be given without any sign of my presence, seemingly as a startling revelation. For no matter how carefully I present the material, it is still bound to change past ideas that are strongly a part of the pupil’s personality. What I say is one thing, but the pupil of course is thrust into psychological and psychic behavior and experience that may seem quite alien to him on a conscious level.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在10:51停顿。)按照我学生生存其中的系统的不同，有不同的问题。举例来说，在你们的系统，并且就我透过她写这本书的女士而言，早在我们的课开始以前，我这方面就已做了最初的接触。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 10:51.) The problems vary according to the system in which my pupil has his or her existence. In your system, for example, and in connection with the woman through whom I now write this book, initial contact on my part was made long before our sessions began.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">她在意识上对最初的会面从来都一无所知，她只感受到突如其来的新想法，而既然她是个诗人，这些想法像诗意的灵感那样出现。在几年前的一次作家会议，她涉入了一种情况，那种情况很可能在她准备好之前，就导致了她灵异的发展，那时那些与会人士的心理气候触发了那种情况，而在她还不明白发生了什么之前珍就进入了出神状态。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The personality was never consciously aware of the initial meeting. She simply experienced sudden new thoughts, and since she is a poet, these appeared as poetic inspirations. At one time some years ago, at a writers’ conference, she became involved in circumstances that could have led to her psychic development before she was ready. The psychological climate at that time, of those involved, initiated the conditions, and without realizing what she was about our friend [Jane] went into a trance.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在11:01停顿了很久。1957年，在珍卖出了她最先的几篇短篇小说后，她受邀参加在宾州密尔费的一个科幻作家会议。我因自己的工作而没能同去，因此珍与西莉儿·康伯勒斯〔现已去世〕一同参加那会议，她是个朋友，一个有名的作家，住在靠近我们家的宾州赛尔城市。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Long pause at 11:01. In 1957, after Jane had sold her first few short stories, she was invited to a conference of science fiction writers at Milford, Pennsylvania. I couldn’t go because of my own work, so Jane attended the conference with Cyril Kornbluth [now deceased], a friend and a well-known writer who lived near our home in Sayre, Pennsylvania.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在某夜的一次讨论会中，珍进入了出神状态。由于此事——一直到多年之后，我们才知那是出神状态——发展出一个作家小组，他们称自己为“五人组”〔the five〕，珍为其中一员。“五人组”的会员间以轮转方式交换长而复杂的书信，组中其他四人当时比珍要有名得多。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane went into a trance one evening during a discussion. Out of this episode ---- which we did not understand was a trance for several years afterward ---- evolved a group of writers, Jane among them, who called themselves “The Five.” Long and involved letters were exchanged among the members of The Five by a round-robin technique. The four other writers in the group were much better known than Jane was.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我在她小时候就知道她有心灵的异禀，但她获得在这个案例中所需的必要背景之前，她必须的洞察力(insights)是透过诗而得到的。直到此人获得了在我们这个个案中所需的必要背景。因此，当我获悉刚才提到的事件，就留意使之结束而不让她再继续下去。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I had known of her psychic gifts since her childhood, but the insights necessary were channeled through the poetry until the personality attained the necessary background that was needed in this particular case. In the affair just mentioned, therefore, I was informed and saw to it that the episode ended and was not pursued.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">可是，那却不是一次意外的演出。比喻来说，这人在并不自知的情况下，决定试试她的羽翼翅膀(够不够硬)。因此，我工作的一部分，就是从她幼年的时候就开始设法训练她——所有这些是为由我们的课而开始的严肃工作做个初步准备。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It was hardly an accidental performance, however. Quite without knowing it, the personality decided to try its wings, figuratively speaking. As a part of my work, therefore, I have been coaching the young woman in one way or another since her childhood ---- and all of this as a preliminary to the serious work that began with our sessions.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这是我在许多存在层面活动的一个正常部分。因为人格结构的不同，我的工作也是非常变化多端的。虽然在我工作的那些系统中有某些基本的相似点，但在某些次元我不适合做老师，只因他们对经验的基本概念对我的天性来说是陌生的，而他们的学习过程也在我的经验之外。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This is a normal part of my activity in many levels of existence. It is highly diversified work, for the personality structures vary. While within the systems in which I work there are certain basic similarities, in some dimensions I would not be equipped to be a teacher simply because the basic concepts of experience would be alien to my nature, and the learning processes themselves outside of my own experience.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可以休息。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(11:09。珍的出神状态很好，“我丝毫不知说的是什么。”她的步调已增快了一点。在11:20继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(11:09. Jane’s trance had been good. “I haven’t the slightest idea what that was all about.” Her pace had picked up a bit. Resume at 11:20.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在下一节中我们再继续我们的书。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: We will continue our book at our next session.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(赛斯为一位新寡的妇人做了几段口述：她曾要求一节赛斯课。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Seth dictated a few paragraphs of material for a woman who had recently lost her husband; she had requested a session.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在我祝你们晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>And now I bid you good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good night, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我衷心的祝福——如果你不必笔录，我会跟你谈得久一点。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>My heartiest regards ---- and if you did not have to take notes, I would talk with you longer.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“谢谢”。11:30结束。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Thank you.” End at 11:30 P.M.)</details><br>
