(除了ESP班外，珍上周没作心灵方面的工作。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Except for ESP class, Jane rested from psychic work last week.)</details>
晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Good evening</details>
(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
我将回答与转世或宗教无关的问题。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I will answer questions that do not deal with reincarnation or religion.</details>
(我们刚在课前谈到那些主题，虽然我没计划在今晚问及它们。“第五十八：除了你在1964年5月4日的第50节里所给‘内在宇宙定律’之外，还有其他的吗？)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(We had been talking about those subjects just before the session, although I hadn’t planned to refer to them tonight. “Number fifty-eight: Are there any more Laws of the Inner Universe, other than those you gave in the 50th session for May 4, 1964?”)</details>
有的，但既然我不在这本书包含那些，我在另外一个时候会把它们给你。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There are, but since I am not covering those in this book, I will give them to you at another time.</details>
(我问这问题是因为我认为在上节里，赛斯对第四十六的答复触及了那些命题之一：“无限可变性与变化定律”(The Law of Infinite Changeability and Transmutation)。虽然，鉴于他现在的答复，我没再更进一步地追问这事。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(I asked the question because I thought Seth’s answer to number forty-six, in the last session, touched upon one of those propositions: “The Law of Infinite Changeability and Transmutation.” In view of his reply now, though, I didn’t pursue the matter further.</details>
(“第四十四：如果你以前没能透过珍来说话，你会试着透过别人这样做吗——或不管怎么样你正在如此做？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Number forty-four: If you hadn’t been able to speak through Jane, would you try to do so through another ---- or are you doing so anyhow?”)</details>
我也曾透过他人说话。你明白吗？“这次”的安排早已经做好了。的确鲁柏不必非得接受这安排不可。如果那样，这资料也会被给出，但以不同的方式。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I have spoken through others. The arrangements “this time” were already made, you see. It is true that Ruburt need not have accepted the arrangement. If so the material would have been given, but in different fashion.</details>
那我就不会以这种方式说话，因为这工作需要某种特殊默契，而且涉及的人格也要有明确的特性。透过另一人，资料可能以一简单得多的方式给予，但我要它尽可能不被扭曲并且面面俱到。如果鲁柏不能参加，这资料会给一个以你们的话来说还活着的“说法者”，他也是涉及创造工作的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I would not have spoken in this way, for this work requires a certain specific rapport, and definite characteristics on the part of the personality involved. Material could have been given in a much more simple fashion through another, but I wanted it as undistorted and fully dimensional as possible. Had Ruburt not been available, the material would have been given to a Speaker, living in your terms, who was also involved in the creative field.</details>
目前还活在你们系统里的人，除了你们自己之外，没有一个在过去我与他有很大的融洽性的。这样一个“说法者”会大半在梦境收到资料，而把它写在一系列的论述与小说的叙述里。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There is no one else presently alive in your system with whom I had any great rapport in the past, except yourselves. Such a Speaker would have received the information largely in the dream state, and written it in a series both of treatises and fictionalized narrative.</details>
可是，若鲁柏未曾接受这工作，极可能他会选在另一生中来完成这个任务，如果那样的话，我就会等他。不过，决定权总在于他，而如果他根本不接受，也会有其他的安排。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Had Ruburt not accepted, however, it is most probable that he would have chosen another life in which to fulfill the task, in which case I would have waited. The decision was always his, however, and had he not accepted at all, other arrangements would have been made.</details>
(对我：)至于你则早已预见你在这些课及我们工作中的角色，多年前，你所画的一幅画清楚预示了你心灵努力之发展。这画你卖掉了，它在现在我的画像所挂的地方挂了一阵子。那是一幅约瑟的画像；换言之，即你当时直觉地感知到你自己的内在身份。你没在意识层面上觉察到这关联，但你却有意识地觉知这幅画对你的强烈冲击。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(To me): Now you early foresaw your part in these sessions, and our work. One of the paintings you did many years ago clearly foreshadowed the development of your psychic endeavors. This was the one you sold, of the man that hung for some time in the position in which my portrait now hangs. That was a portrait of Joseph; in other words of your own inner identity as you intuitively perceived it at the time. You were not consciously aware of the connection, but you were consciously aware of the painting’s strong impact.</details>
(自然我知道那幅画。那是1954年在珍和我还未结婚前，我在佛罗里达画的。我有它的照片，心想哪天再重画一次。当然，这意指我只是画一幅那旧画的新版本，不可能真正地复制它。然而我并不后悔卖了那张画。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(I know the painting, of course. I painted it in Florida in 1954, before Jane and I were married. I have photographs of it, and intend to repaint it some day. This means, of course, that I’ll only be painting a new version of the old. It would be impossible to truly duplicate it. I have no regrets about selling the painting, though.)</details>
它也代表你那追寻的、在创造性上没满足的部分，在寻找更进一步的了解与知识。存在于你和鲁柏之间的奇特关系也是一个先决条件，同时你的准许与接受也是必要的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It represented also the searching, creatively dissatisfied portion of you, looking for further understanding and knowledge. The peculiar relationship existing between you and Ruburt was also a prerequisite, and so your permission and acceptance was also needed.</details>
如果你一直不肯参与，这课程就不会开始。你们曾与同一个“存有”相连，虽然你已由它跳开了，但内在的关系加增了可用的能量。可以说，你有助于稳定那电路。你也发动了最初的能量与原动力，来帮助鲁柏自己的能量与动力。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Had you remained apart, the sessions would not have begun. You have been connected with the same entity, though you have sprung apart from it, but the inner relationship adds to the power available. You help steady the circuit, so to speak. You also generated initial energy and impetus to help Ruburt’s own.</details>
这种工作不只使得选择一个个人成为必要，而且也是一个必须考虑到许多其他因素的努力。例如，我们知道鲁柏需要你的支持，就如我们也知道这工作本身会有助于你自己的创造能力。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Such work does not only necessitate the choosing of one individual, but is also an endeavor in which many other elements are taken into consideration. It was known, for example, that Ruburt would need your support, as it was also known that the work itself would help your own creative abilities.</details>
所有这些是在你们还没开始这特定的一生之前，由你俩，也由我决定的。甚至鲁柏理性上的质疑与常有很深的“勉强”感觉，也事先就知道了，而被改装成有助于所涉及的工作。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>All of this was decided by you both, and by me before you began this particular lifetime. Even Ruburt’s intellectual questioning and often deep reluctance was known in advance, and adapted to aid in the work involved.</details>
这资料并不是要给“天生的信徒”，而是给聪明的人们，并且是给一个会质问它的“灵媒”，他不仅为他自己去质问，也为了所有那些与他有同样疑问的人。因此，当鲁柏渐渐有所了解，当他继续发展，他不仅为自己，也为那些追随他冒险的人赢得了胜利。但我们也需要一个平衡，因而你充当这样一个人，直觉地认知内在资讯的价值及资料的重要性，虽然你对这类概念并不熟悉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The information was not to be given to “born believers,” but to intelligent people, and to a “medium” who questioned it, not only for himself but for all those given to the same kind of questioning. As Ruburt grows to understand, therefore, and as he continues to develop, he triumphs not only for himself but for all those who follow his ventures. And yet we wanted a balance also, and so you stand as a man who intuitively recognized the value of inner information and the importance of the material, even though you were unacquainted with such ideas.</details>
(10:00)在深得多的层面，鲁柏那方并没有“勉强”，不然他的能力不会以这种方式发展。他在开始的批评，同时也可作为是在安抚有第一次经验的“自我”，保证它不会被推到一边或在任何方面受到损伤。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:00.) It goes without saying that on much deeper levels there is no reluctance on Ruburt’s part, or the abilities would not have developed in this fashion. His criticism in the beginning served also as reassurance to the ego, in its first experiences, that it would not be shoved aside or damaged in any fashion.</details>
做为“灵媒”所需的特性，非常像任一个具有强烈创造性的人所需的一样。一个坚强、肯予支持的“自我”是必要的，尤其是在开始的阶段。在严重的人格困扰可能随着伟大的创造力同时发生的时期，自我是被创造能力的力量吓坏了，害怕自己可能被它压碎。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The characteristics needed for “mediumship” are much like those needed by any strongly creative person. A strong supportive ego is a necessity, particularly in initial stages. In periods of severe personality disturbances that can occur simultaneously with great creativity, the ego becomes terrified of the strength of the creative ability, fearing that it can be crushed beneath.</details>
在这种情形下，自我太僵化，而不随着此人的整个创造性经验一起扩展。当然这能发生在“通灵术”这种事上，就如能发生于任何其他的这种创造活动上一样。不过，在此例中，鲁柏的自我逐渐开始放松它的僵化，而在一个渐进的过程里，容许整个的人格——包括它自己——扩展。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In such cases the ego is too rigid, and does not expand with the nature of the personality’s whole creative experience. Of course this could happen with mediumship, as with any other such activity. In this case, however, Ruburt’s ego gradually began to let its rigidity go, in a gradual process that allowed the whole personality, itself included, to expand.</details>
现在暂且结束口述，还有一个私人的注。你可以看出以上的资讯在何处与鲁柏接上了关系。如你目前所读的书里说的话，把“肌肉铁甲放松”这个主意很不错。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>End of dictation for now, and a personal note. You can see where the above information ties in with Ruburt. The idea of letting the muscular armor go, as in your current reading, is good.</details>
你可以休息一下，然后我们将继续此节。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You can take your break, and then we will resume the session.</details>
(10:09。珍的出神状态很深，她的传述很快。她说当赛斯说到一九五四年的画时，她可以很清楚地看到它，包括它宽宽的、老式的金框。她告诉我，最先她已忘了框的样子，但现在却正确地描述出来。自然，在我们对它的重要性还未产生任何有意识的觉察前，这画已卖掉了。这不仅是在课开始前，而且是在我们甚至还没怀疑到有这种可能性之前。课的余下部分从记录中删去了，在10:28结束。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:09. Jane’s trance had been deep, her delivery fast. She said she could see the 1954 painting very clearly while Seth talked about it, including its wide, old-fashioned gold frame. At first she had forgotten what the frame looked like, she told me, but now correctly described it. Naturally, the painting was sold before we had any conscious awareness of its import. This would be not only before the sessions began, but before we even suspected such possibilities. The balance of the session is deleted from the record. End at 10:28 P.M.) * Inner vibrational touchis one of our Inner senses. Seth lists these in Chapter Nineteen of The Seth Material. To paraphrase: Using this sense, an observer standing on a typical street would feel the experience of being anything he chose within his field of notice: people, trees, insects, blades of grass. He would retain his own consciousness, and would perceive sensations somewhat in the way we now feel heat and cold. This sense is like empathy, but much more vital.</details>
