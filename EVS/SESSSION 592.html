<div style="display:inline">(因为我对基督的时代所知甚少，我花了好些时间来作必要的额外阅读，以便我能为赛斯课写适当的注，苏·华京斯——珍的ESP班上的一员，并且是我们私人的朋友——很帮忙；她借给我许多谈那段时候的书，使得我能对历史性的参考有把握。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Since I knew so little about the time of Christ, it’s taken me a while to do the extra reading necessary so that I could write appropriate session notes. Sue Watkins·, a member of Jane’s ESP class and our personal friend, has been very helpful; she has loaned me books on the period so that I could be sure of historical references.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(珍和我被近来的活动弄得很累，差点想错过这节，只是她不想打断我们已建立起来的节奏。苏在场做为证人。我们全都期待轻松的一节——可能触及涉及了我们三个人目前的事，好比由一只病得厉害的猫，到我们上周五晚上的即兴“转世剧”。但我们确乎没预期赛斯继续谈他在书中开始的有关圣经时代的资料。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane and I were tired from our recent activities and might have missed the session, except that she didn’t want to interrupt the rhythm we’d built up. Sue sat in as a witness. All of us expected an easygoing session ---- one that might touch upon current events involving the three of us, from a very ill feline, say, to our impromptu Friday evening “reincarnational dramas.” But we certainly didn’t expect Seth to continue the material he’d begun in his book relating to biblical times.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我该吓你们一下，说：“第一章”，但我不会那样做。我向我们这儿的朋友(苏)道晚安。你不久就能读我的书的完整版本了。(对我：)我有一些注可为你所用。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I should frighten you by saying, “Chapter One,” but I will not. And good evening to our friend here (Sue). You will shortly be able to read my book in its entirety. (To me): I have a few notes for your edification.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好的。”赛斯的步调颇快。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“All right.” Seth’s pace was rather fast.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">请等我们一会儿。艾赛尼派在希腊的一些神秘宗教里有很深的根，有一些艾赛尼派设立了学校，而这些学校并不是表面上看来的那样。他们用了“掩饰”。在一个“入门者”能接近那内部的教义之前，必须先通过各种考验。(停顿。)因此，除了通常所谓的那个艾赛尼派外，还有其他的艾赛尼团体。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Give us a moment. Now. The Essenes had deep roots in some of the mystery religions of the Greeks. Some of the Essenes set up schools that were not what they appeared to be. Subterfuge was used. There were various tests applied before an initiate could come close to the interior doctrines. (Pause.) There were other groups of Essenes, therefore, beside the one generally spoken of.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(通常所知的艾赛尼团体应是第一世纪之初基督时代在圣地的犹太教的一派。历史上他们被认为是一个和平的团体。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(The Essene group generally known would be the Jewish sect in the Holy Land during the time of Christ, early in the first century. Historically they are thought of as a peaceful group.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如人们所知的艾赛尼派是一个更大更古老的同志会幸存团体，其中有一些存在于小亚细亚。他们努力渗透到国家性或团体性的文化里，因此，有某些基本概念联合着艾赛尼派，虽然他们常用不同的名字行于世。(停顿。)有三个基本团体：一般所想的那个，在非洲的一个分枝，以及先前提及的小亚细亚团体。不过，在这些团体之间少有接触，内部的教义本身也逐渐显出了重要的变调。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The Essenes, as they are known, were a surviving group from a larger and more ancient brotherhood. Some existed in Asia Minor. Efforts were made to infiltrate into national or group cultures. Certain basic ideas united the Essenes, therefore, though often they went by different names. (Pause.) There were three basic groups: the one generally thought of, an offshoot in Africa, and the Asia Minor group mentioned earlier. Little contact existed between these groups, however, and gradually the inner doctrines themselves showed important variations.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他们办的学校常常假装在其他领域授以教育。陌生人将被留在这外围团体。有些上这种学校的人从不知那些内部的入门者，以及在伪装之下所进行的更重要工作。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The schools often pretended to be giving an education in other areas. The stranger would be kept in this outer group. Some attended such schools without ever knowing of the inner initiates, and the more important work being carried on beneath the camouflage.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">有些“狂热派”的会员最初曾是艾赛尼派。艾赛尼派在狂热派之前。施洗约翰在所有重要的方面都可说是艾赛尼派；但一个以这种方式踏向前的人，就自动踏出了他的团体，你们的朋友约翰就是如此。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Some of the members of the Zealots were originally Essenes. The Essenes predated them. John the Baptist was an Essene in all important ways; yet a man who steps forward in such a way automatically steps out of his group, and so did your friend, John.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在此赛斯幽默地提到了我最近对施洗约翰的兴趣。“狂热派”是一个远较激进而半政治性的犹太教派，也在第一世纪早期存在于圣地——如我从最近的阅读中发现的。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Here Seth humorously referred to my recent interest in John the Baptist. The Zealots were a much more aggressive, semipolitical Jewish sect that also existed in the Holy Land early in the first century ---- as I discovered from my recent reading.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:46)于是，某些艾赛尼派的人对约翰的进展有些嫉妒。有一个时候，约翰曾试图将各个分歧的团体合为一个同志会，但他失败了。这失败沉重地压在他心上。火很少是温和的，而施洗约翰就与保罗一样充满了火。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:46.) There was some jealousy, then, from certain members of the Essenes at John’s progress. At one time John attempted to join various divergent groups together as one brotherhood, but he failed. The failure weighed heavily upon him. Fire is seldom gentle, and John the Baptist was as filled with fire as Paul.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他是个远较温和的人，却以他自己的方式也与当时的任何其他主要人物一样狂热。他反对他所反对的事比他赞成他所赞成的事要强烈得多。你明白吗？基督是要传递那讯息，而约翰是要为它预先铺路。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>He was a far more gentle man, and yet in his own way as fanatical as any of the other main characters of that day. He was much more against what he was against, than for what he was for. Christ, you see, was to deliver the message and John was to prepare the way for it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">约翰年轻时曾与一位表妹联姻。因为他相信这是有罪的，终其一生他逃避此事，不予承认。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>John had an alliance with a female cousin, as a youth. He fled from the knowledge of this for the rest of his life, believing it sinful.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">且说，这些人就像风帆似地被他们所扮角色的能量所充满，但他们必得有他们那时代人的性格特色。在基督能宣称他自己超越了自然的人类之前，他们必须在人前以凡人的样子出现。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now these were men filled out like sails with the energy of their roles, yet they had to have the personality characteristics of their time. They had to appear as men before men, before Christ could proclaim himself as anything beyond the natural man.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这些“纠葛”是在那宗教剧的范围内必须要有的，它们是有创造性的，因为在它们之内，携有对你们来说在当时当地所能生长的唯一种子。(较快活地：)喂，我们不必如此正式。书的口述结束了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The entanglements were those that were necessary in the context of that religious drama. They were creative in that they bore within them the only seeds that could grow, in your terms, within that place and that time. (More heartily): Now, we do not have to be so formal. Book dictation is over.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“真的吗？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Is it?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">真的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It is indeed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好吧。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Okay.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们可以问我一个问题，或休息一下，随你们的便。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may ask me a question or take a break as you prefer.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“那我们就休息一下。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“We’ll take the break then.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(对苏：)我常在梦中对此人说话，我不想占据你所有其余清醒的时间。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(To Sue): I talk to this one in the dream state often. I do not want to take up all your waking time besides.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:56—10:00)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:56 to 10:00.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">记录常常被篡改；完全地假造，常常故意安插错误的记录。那时宗教即政治，它暗示对群众的控制与权力。统治者的任务就是要知道宗教的“风向”。那时以及后来，都有对事实的故意篡改。有些教派故意保留错误的记录作为掩饰，因此如果这些被偷了，那些强盗会以为他们得到了他们想要的东西。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Records were often falsified; completely doctored, and false records were often planted. Religion was politics. It implied sway and power over the masses. It was the business of the rulers to know in which direction the religious winds blew. There were deliberate falsifications of fact, then and later. Some sects kept false records on purpose as blinds, so that if these were stolen, the robbers would think they had what they were after.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在有些情形，伪造的记录——虚伪的陈述——已被找到了，同时在它们后面的真正记录却尚未被发现。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In some cases the falsified records have been found ---- the misrepresentations ---- while the true records behind them have not as yet been discovered.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(停顿。)你最好记住在哪一节里给了你这个资讯。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause.) You had better remember in what session that information was given you.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“我不太懂你的意思。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“I don’t quite get what you mean.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">要不了多久你也许会有理由要查核我刚才说的，因为会有似乎与先前记录矛盾——它们的确会如此——的记录出现，并且正是因为刚才所说的理由。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Before too long you may have reason to check upon what I have said, for records will appear that seem to contradict previous ones ---- as indeed they shall ---- and because of the reasons just given.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">艾赛尼派保留了几套记录来混淆那些“狂热派”，另一套来混淆罗马人，而他们十分小心地护卫着那“内圈”的一套真实记录，从那儿造出所有的事实。他们并不像其他团体一样狂暴，但却是一样的精明。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The Essenes kept sets of records to confuse the Zealots, and another set to confuse the Romans, and they very carefully guarded the inner set from which all the facts were made. They were not as violent as the other groups, but they were as shrewd.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:06)可是，他们做下了记号来分辨种种不同的记录，真的和假的。(珍做为赛斯，停了下来，一只手拿到眼睛上。)现在，我不知道我们能否把这清楚地传过来……给鲁柏一张纸，我们一起来看看。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:06.) There were various marks made, however, to distinguish the various sets of records, true and false. (Jane paused as Seth, a hand to her eyes.) Now, I do not know whether or not we can get this through clearly… Give Ruburt a piece of paper, and together we will see.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(这节是在我们的客厅里举行的，珍坐在她的摇椅里，面对着坐在沙发上的苏和我。我们的长咖啡桌在我们之间。在珍的左边有盏灯，在我身旁也有一盏灯。苏递给珍一张纸和一支笔，我则在继续记录。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(The session was being held in our living room. Jane sat in her rocker, facing Sue and me on the couch. Our long coffee table separated us. There was a light to Jane’s left, and one lit beside me. Sue handed Jane a piece of paper and a pen, while I continued to take notes.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(这是珍第一回在出神状态中写东西。她真的在画一些小的图形或符号，相当慎重地移动笔，眯着眼看纸。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(This was the first time Jane had written anything while in trance. Actually she was making some small diagrams or symbols, moving the pen quite deliberately, squinting down at the paper.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(苏坐在珍的正对面，当珍把笔放下而开始为赛斯描写那些符号时，我做手势请苏把那些符号编号。珍差不多画了一分钟。描出来的符号如图所示，以赛斯——珍画出它们的次序编了号。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Sue sat just opposite Jane, and I gestured for her to number the symbols when Jane lay the pen down and began to describe them for Seth. About a minute had passed. Tracings of the symbols are shown below, numbered in the sequence in which Seth-Jane produced them.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(第一个与最后一个符号，她试画了两次。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Two attempts were made at both the first and last signs.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">1号是想画出2号的尝试，2号只是一个“作了副本”的记号，作了一个扭曲或篡改了的副本。中央那个(3号)是“一个扭曲少得多的副本”的记号，而最后的记号(5号)是“一个未经篡改的记录”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now, number one is an attempt to get at number two, which was simply a sign of a copy made, a distorted or doctored copy. The middle one, (three), was a mark made for a much less distorted copy, and the last mark, (five), was for an undoctored record.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这些是很差的版本。这个看来更像一条蛇，一条蟒蛇。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>These are poor versions. This looked more like a snake, a serpent.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(当珍把纸举起来给苏和我看的时候，她指着最后一个符号，替赛斯加强语气地说。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Speaking emphatically for Seth, Jane pointed at the last symbol as she held the paper up for Sue and me to see.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(关于符号……在1947年学者开始获得现已出名的七个《死海经卷》。它们是在位于多半为干燥的昆兰谷或昆兰河床之上的山洞中找到的。这河床导向约一里之外的死海。在附近犹地亚沙漠的挖掘很快地露出一座修道院的遗迹，它在不同的时代，在公元前180年与公元后68年间曾被不同的犹太团体所占据。这昆兰居留地离耶路撒冷与伯利恒只有十五里。有些权威人士把它与和平的艾赛尼派相连，同时另一些专家则同样强烈地把它与更富攻击性的“狂热派”联想在一起。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Concerning symbols… In 1947 scholars began acquiring the seven now famous Dead Sea Scrolls. They had been found in a cave situated above the usually dry Qumran wadi, or riverbed, which leads to the Dead Sea a mile or so away. Excavations in the Judaean desert nearby soon revealed the ruins of a monastery which had been occupied by a divergent Jewish group, for varying periods, between 180 B.C. and A.D. 68. The Qumran settlement was but fifteen miles from Jerusalem and Bethlehem. It has been linked with the peaceful Essene sect by some authorities, while others just as strongly associate it with the more aggressive Zealots.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在这节的几个星期之后，珍和我很感兴趣地读到，从昆兰发现圣马可的《以赛亚书卷》(Isaiavb Scroll)包括了些卷缘的符号，到1960年代仍未被破解出来；这是按我们所查阅的参考资料最近的一版所说的。附图画出来的符号，有些与赛斯——珍画的那些不止有一点想象——尤其是最后的一个。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Some weeks after this session Jane and I were interested to read that the St. Mark’s Isaiah Scroll, from the Qumran find, contains marginal symbols that had still not been deciphered by the 1960’s; this according to the last printing of the reference work we consulted. Some of the symbols, which were illustrated, bear more than a little resemblance to those Seth-Jane drew ---- especially the last one.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">除了最内圈的人外，任何人几乎都不可能分辨出现的某些版本。这些符号不会孤立地出现，而是以这样一种方式，使得只有那些知道如何找它们的人才找得到。它们不会在首页上闪着金光(幽默地)。也还有其他的线索，某些出现在原文中的其他记号得与这些一起研究才行。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It would be nearly impossible for anyone except one of the innermost circle to distinguish between some of the versions presented. These signs would not appear isolated, but in such a fashion that only those who knew how to look for them would find them. They were not blazed in gold on the title page. (Humorously.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">缺</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There were other clues also, certain other signs to be taken in conjunction with these, that appeared within the texts.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:17)现在，在某些这种记录里，举例来说，日期记错的程度刚好可使得唯有精通此道的人才能认出一个不符之处。有些则会包括一个明显的错误，那些熟悉内幕的人会立即认出这记录是假的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:17.) Now, in some of these records, the dating, for example, would be just off enough so that only one well-versed would recognize a discrepancy. Some would include an obvious error. Those in the know would immediately recognize that the record was a fake.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">有些扭曲了的记录被认作是事实，当你了解到梵蒂岗还保存着其中的一些，真是令人好笑。在当时，教会相信这些记录可以伤害它。其实在这些特定的错误例子里，这些记录反而可能对神职人员有助，但他们没有辨别真伪的见识。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Some of the distorted records have been taken as fact, and it is a good joke to realize that the Vatican holds some of these. At the time, the church believed that these records could harm it. In the case of these particular errors, the records instead could have helped the churchmen, but they did not have the sense to know the truth from the false.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在你们可以休息一下。(对苏打手势：)她对我说得这么慢不大习惯。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now you may take your break. (A gesture to Sue): She is not used to my speaking so slowly.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:20。苏习于听赛斯在ESP班上更快的说话，在那儿是用录音机录音。我通常不给赛斯录音，而是直接用我自己的这种速记法逐字笔记；这在我后来把资料打字时省了不少时间。往往在我们的课里，赛斯仍说得快到使我一直得以最快的速度写。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:20. Sue is used to hearing Seth speak more rapidly in ESP class, where tape recorders are used. I don’t record Seth usually but make direct verbatim notes, using my own kind of shorthand; this saves much time later when I type up the material. Still, Seth often speaks fast enough in our own sessions to keep me writing at top speed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(无疑的，赛斯对梵谛岗保留了被篡改的记录觉得好玩，是由于他自己在某一生中短短地担任过教宗之职。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(No doubt Seth’s amusement at the Vatican holding doctored records stems from his own brief tenure as Pope in one of his lives.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(现在当苏和我开始讨论珍在出神状态中所画的图时，赛斯回来了。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Now Seth returned as Sue and I began to discuss the drawings Jane had done in trance.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因为这些对鲁柏是无意义的，所以就很难让他清楚地了解这符号。例如，它们该画得紧密得多，而非这样稀松。在实际上这些符号应出现为紧密集中的符号，线条也较粗。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Since these are meaningless to Ruburt, it is difficult to get the symbolism across to him clearly. They should be drawn much more tightly, for example, not so loosely. In actuality the signs would appear as tightly concentrated symbols, and thicker in line.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:24。在休息时，珍告诉我们，她不能以她在出神状态中所画的为本，再来重画那些符号的新版本。她说：“当我在画它们时，我脑海里相当清楚地看到它们。然而我现在却什么也看不到。”看着最后一个图，第5号，珍确实说了那蛇的尾巴应当是由较低的弯代表的。在10:45继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:24. At break, Jane told us she couldn’t draw versions of the symbols based upon those she’d done in trance. “I saw them quite clearly, mentally, when I was doing them,” she said. “I don’t see anything now, though.” Looking at the last drawing, number five, Jane did say that the serpent’s tail was supposed to be represented by the lower loop. Resume at 10:45)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">请等我们一会儿。(停顿。)在许多情形，记录被忠实地复制了，但名字被改掉以保护无辜者。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Give us a moment. (Pause.) In many cases records were faithfully reproduced, but with the names changed to protect the innocent.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">想想政府和外交人员目前所用的语言，想想你们政府所知与所告诉给人民的，中间的不同。常常当你在这种情况下听见一项否认，你立刻跳到正确的结论——就是在一个月左右会给同样的问题一个肯定的回答。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Think of the language used presently by governments and diplomats. Think of the difference between what your government knows, and what is told to the people. Often when you hear a denial in such circumstances, you immediately leap to the correct conclusion ---- that in a month or so an affirmative answer will be given to the same question.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此，文字除了用来透露也常用来掩饰。在文字的运用上，人们常常花了很大的力气以使知识不为多数人所知，而只给少数人。在圣经时代这更是真的。文学性的设计本身已成为形式化了的方法，表面上好像放任某种资讯，同时实际上却供给错误的资料。在那些日子从来没有一个问题得到直接的回答(强调地)——只要是稍有学识的人都是如此。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Words, therefore, are often used to cover up as well as to reveal. Great efforts are taken so that knowledge is kept, often, from a majority and for a few. In Biblical times this was all the more true. Literary devices themselves served as formalized methods of seeming to indulge certain information, while actually offering instead falsified data. No question in those days was answered directly (emphatically) ---- not by those who were at all literate.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">直接回答一个问题表示你头脑简单，根本不会欣赏询问者的聪明才智，因为他很少问一个他真的想要得到答复的问题。这是极度仪式化的行为；不过，大家也彼此心照不宣。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>To answer a question directly meant that you were simpleminded and lacked any appreciation of the questioner’s greater intelligence, for he seldom asked a question he really wanted answered. It was highly ritualized behavior; understood, however, in those terms.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">换言之，你不了解如何适当的翻译许多这种记录，甚至当翻译本身是正确的时候也不见得有用。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In other words, you do not understand how to translate the material properly from many of those records, even when the translations per se are correct.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你会叫整页整页的[死海]经卷为惊人的“伪作”，说实在的，既然整页整页，全不是真的。但这些都是在给资讯之前为人所预期的夸张与润色。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You would call whole pages of the [Dead Sea] Scrolls tremendous put-ons, since whole pages, in literal terms, are not true. But these were expected exaggerations and embellishments that preceded the giving of information.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:55)各种行业或多或少也都有这种做法。这些记录若在错误的时机被发现，那是生死攸关的事。常常有所篡改只是为了要把读者导入歧途，如果这些书落在外人手里的话。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:55.) All professions, to one extent or another, had such fashions. The records meant life or death if they were discovered at the wrong time. Falsifications were often put in simply to lead any readers astray if the books fell in the wrong hands.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">至于那些知道内幕的人从来就不必担忧，他们不会被误导。在他们看来，资讯很清楚，而扭曲显而易见。那么“经卷”里就充满了这种保护性的扭曲。前面我所提及的符号只是所用线索中的一些而已。它们以许多扮像出现，有时还与签字纠结在一起。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Again, those in the know had no worries. They would not be misled. To them the information was clear and the distortions obvious. Now the Scrolls are full of such protective distortions. The signs mentioned were but some of the clues used. They appeared in many guises, sometimes intertwined with signatures.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这些人颇为偏爱密码；甚至字母在书页上的安排，都有它们的意义。各种不同笔划的轻重或浓淡就强调某些事上来说有其意义。甚至有某种方法处理一个在前面的字，因此那个字会是一个线索，指出下一个字是错的。当然，只有那些知道内幕的人才会认出这个线索，而其他的人会快活地消化了错误的资讯。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>These people were much given to codes; even the arrangement of the letters upon the pages, as you think of pages, had their meanings. The weight or thickness of various strokes had meaning in terms of emphasis. There were even certain ways of handling a preceding word, so that the word would be a clue that the next word was false. Only those in the know would recognize this, of course, and the others would merrily digest the false information.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">对重要人物的描写也被改了，以保证他们的安全，而为了同样的理由，背景也常是假造的，这些都是生死攸关的斗争。有些假造过的记录，文稿上有毒药——的确是要命的读物。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Descriptions of important individuals were changed to insure their safety, and backgrounds were often fictional for the same reason. These were life and death struggles. Some of the falsified records had poison on the manuscripts ---- deadly reading material indeed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(虽然加了幽默，赛斯——珍在给这资料时是非常强调而严肃的。步调很快。在11:00停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(In spite of the humor, Seth-Jane was very emphatic and serious in giving this material. The pace was fast. Pause at 11:00.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那时许多牵涉在内的人的确过着双重生活，在他们的村子里用一个名字，而在同志会里用另一个。在有些情形，他们比较世俗的身份从未被泄漏，除了对少数几个人之外。后来，当基督徒被迫害时，他们用了许多安全措施——尤其是那些相信他们有责任苟活到能眼见新的“使徒信条”找到沃土的时候。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Many of the men involved did lead double lives then, known in their villages by one name, and in their brotherhoods by another. In some cases, their more mundane identities were never divulged but to a few. Later, when the Christians were being persecuted, there were many safeguards taken ---- particularly by those who believed they had a responsibility to live long enough to see the new creed find fertile ground.</details><br>
