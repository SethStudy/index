<a id=1 href=1>第538节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>JUNE 29, 1970, 9:07 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1970年6月29日 星期一 晚上9：07</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Humorously): Now: Chapter Ten: “‘Death’ Conditions in Life.” (Seth repeated this chapter heading to make sure I punctuated it correctly.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(幽默地：)现在：第十章。(赛斯重复这章的标题以确定我的标题正确。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>After-death experiences will not seem so alien or incomprehensible if you realize that you encounter similar situations as a normal part of your present existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你领悟到在你目前的存在里，遭到“死后经验”是个正常部分，你就不会把那种经验看成那么陌生或不可解了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In sleep and dream states you are involved in the same dimension of existence in which you will have your after-death experiences. You do not remember the most important part of these nightly adventures, and so those you do recall seem bizarre or chaotic as a rule. This is simply because in your present state of development you are not able to manipulate consciously within more than one environment.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在睡眠和梦中，你涉入的存在次元，就与你在死后经验的相同。你不记得这夜夜探险的最重要部分，因此一般而言，那些你的确记得的部分，就好像是古怪或混乱的了。这只是因为以你目前的发展情形，你不能有意识的在一个以上的环境中操作。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You do exist consciously in a coherent, purposeful creative state while the physical body sleeps, however, and you carry on many of the activities that I told you would be encountered after death. You simply turn the main focus of your attention in a different dimension of activity, one in which you have indeed continuously operated.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，肉体在睡觉时，你的确有意识地存在于一个前后一贯、有目的的创造状态，而你从事许多我告诉你在死后会遇到的活动。你只是把注意力的主要焦点转向一个不同的活动次元，你的确一直在其中持续运作。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:15.) Now, as you have memory of your waking life and as you retain a large body of such memory for daily physical encounters, and as this fount of memory provides you with a sense of daily continuity, so also does your dreaming self have an equally large body of memory. As there is continuity to your daily life, so there is continuity in your sleeping life.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:15)现在，就如你对你的醒时生活有记忆，就如你保留了一大团这种记忆以便作每日的实质接触，就如这记忆的泉源提供你一种日复一日的连续感，同样，你作梦的自身也有一个同样大的记忆团。就如你的日间生活有连续性，同样的，你的睡眠生活也有连续性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>A portion of you, therefore, is aware of each and every dream encounter and experience. Dreams are no more hallucinatory than your physical life is. Your waking physical self is the dreamer, as far as your dreaming self is concerned: You are the dreamer it sends on its way. Your daily experiences are the dreams that it dreams, so when you look at your dreaming self or consider it, you do so with a highly prejudiced eye, taking it for granted that your “reality” is real, and its reality is illusion .</a>
<a id=1 href=1>所以，你有个部分是知觉到每一个梦中遭遇和经验的。梦并不比你的物质生活更虚幻。就你作梦的自己而言，你醒时具体的自己才是个做梦的人：你是它派出去的做梦者。你的日间经验是它做的梦，因此你是以一种极具偏见的眼光去看或想到你做梦的自己，把你的“实相”视为当然，而把它的视为幻相。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:20.) Its reality is far more native to your being, however. If you do not find coherence in the dream state, it is because you have hypnotized yourselves into believing that none exists. Of course you try to translate your nightly adventures into physical terms upon awakening, and attempt to fit them into your often limited distortion of the nature of reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:20)不过，对你的“存在体”来说，梦中实相远比物质实相要天然(native)得多了。如果你在梦境发现不到前后连贯的情形，是因为你把自己催眠到相信根本没有连贯存在。当然在你醒来时，你试着把夜的探险转译为实质的说法，试图使它们符合你对实相本质往往有限的扭曲。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>To some extent this is natural. You are focused in a daily life for a reason. You have adopted it as a challenge. But within its framework you are also meant to grow and develop, and to extend the limits of your consciousness. It is very difficult to admit that you are in many ways more effective and creative in the sleep state than the waking state, and somewhat shattering to admit that the dream body can indeed fly, defying both time and space. It is much easier to pretend that all such experiences are symbolic and not literal, to evolve complicated psychological theories, for example, to explain flying dreams.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在某个程度这是自然的。你聚焦于日间生活中是有其理由的，你把它当作一个挑战。但你本也要在其架构内成长与发展，并扩展你意识的限制。要承认你在睡眠状态比醒时状态在许多方面更有效率和创造力是很困难的。而承认梦的身体不受时空限制而的确能飞，多少会令人感到震憾。假装所有这种经验都不是真的，而是象征性的，好比说，发展出复杂的心理学理论来解释梦，要容易得多了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The simple fact is that when you dream you are flying, you often are. In the dream state you operate under the same conditions, more or less, that are native to a consciousness not focused in physical reality. Many of your experiences, therefore, are precisely those you may meet after death. You may speak with dead friends or relatives, revisit the past, greet old classmates, walk down streets that existed fifty years earlier in physical time, travel through space without taking any physical time to do so, be met by guides, be instructed, teach others, perform meaningful work, solve problems, hallucinate.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>简单的事实是，当你梦到你在飞时，你往往真的在飞。在梦境，你多少是与那些“不聚焦于物质实相中的意识”在相同的情况下运作，而那情况是它们的天然环境。所以，你许多的经验就与你在死后可能遭遇的完全一样。你可能与已死的朋友或亲人交谈、重游过去、问候老同学、走过实际存在于五十年前的街道、不花任何时间而游过空间、向导来接你和教导你、你教别人、做有意义的工作、解决问题、发生幻觉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In physical life there is a lag between the conception of an idea and its physical construction. In dream reality, this is not so. Therefore, the best way to become acquainted with after-death reality ahead of time, so to speak, is to explore and understand the nature of your own dreaming self. Not very many people want to take the time or energy.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在物质生活里，在概念的孕育和它具体的建构之间有一段时间。在梦的实相里却非如此。因此可以说，在事先熟悉死后实相的最好方法就是，探索、了解你作梦的自己的本质，但是没有多少人想花这个时间或气力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The methods are available, however, and those who do use them will not find themselves alienated when the full focus of their attention is turned in that direction after death.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，方法是有的，而那些真的用这些方法的人，在死后当他们注意力的全部焦点都转向那个方向时，他们不会感觉陌生。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在，你可以休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:34 to 9:47.) Now: Since your conscious memory is connected so strongly with awareness within the body, although you leave the body when it sleeps, the waking consciousness usually has no memory of this.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:34—9:47。)既然你有意识的记忆是这么强地与肉体内的知觉相连，所以虽然在睡眠中你离开了肉体，醒时的意识却通常还记得有这一回事。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In the sleeping state, you have memory of everyone you have ever met in your dreams, though you may or may not have met some of these people in your daytime existence. In the sleeping state you may have constant experience through the years with close associates who may live in another portion of the world entirely, and be strangers to you in the waking state.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在睡眠状态，你记得在梦中遇见过的每一个人，虽然在你的日间生活里可能有些人没见过。在睡眠状态中，你可能与完全住在世界另一部分的人有多年的密切交往，在醒时状态他们对你来说却是陌生人。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As your daily endeavors have meaning and purpose, so do your dream adventures, and in these also you attain various goals of your own. These you will continue in the after-death experience. The vitality, force, life, and creativity behind your physical existence is generated in this other dimension. In other words, you are in many ways a fleshy projection of your dreaming self.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>就如你日间的努力有其意义与目的，你的梦中探险也是如此，在其中你也达到自己的各种不同目标。在死后经验里你会继续这些事。在你肉体存在背后的活力、力量、生命力与创造力，都是由这另一个次元中发动的。换言之，在许多方面你是你作梦的自己一个有血有肉的投射。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The dreaming self as you conceive of it, however, is but a shadow of its own reality, for the dreaming self is a psychological point of reference and, in your terms, [of] continuity, that brings together all portions of your identity. Of its deeper nature, only the most developed are aware. It represents, in other words, one strong uniting facet of your entire identity. Its experiences are as vivid and its “personality” as rich ---- in fact richer ---- in context as the physical personality you know.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，你所理解的那个“作梦的自己”，只是它自己实相的一个影子，因为作梦的自己是个心理的参考点(psychological point of reference)。以你们的话来说，是一个心理的连续点，把你本体的所有部分都带到一块儿。对它更深的性质，只有发展到最高境界的人才能知觉到。换言之，它代表你整个本体的一个强力统合面(uniting facet)。就此而论，它与你所知的具肉身的你经验一样生动、“个性”一样丰富——事实上还更丰富些。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Pretend for a moment that you are a child, and I am trying to undertake the particular chore of explaining to you what your most developed, adult self will be like ---- and in my explanation, I say that this adult self is to some extent already a part of you, an outgrowth or projection of what you are. And the child says, “But what will happen to me? Must I die to become this other self? I do not want to change. How can I ever be this adult self when it is not what I am now, without dying as what I am?”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>暂时假设你是个孩子，而我正试着向你解释，发展到巅峰状态的成人的你将是什么样子——在我的解释里，我说那个成人在某程度已是你的一部分，是现在的你的一个自然发展或投射。而那孩子说：“但我会怎么样？我一定要先死了才会变成这另外一个我吗？我不想改变。如果现在的我不死，怎么可能变成不是现在的我的这个成人的我呢？”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I am in somewhat the same position when I try to explain to you the nature of this inner self, for while you can become aware of it in dreams, you cannot truly appreciate its maturity or abilities; yet they are yours in the same way that the man’s abilities belonged to the child. In the dream state you learn, among other things, how to construct your own physical reality day by day, just as after death you learn how to construct your next physical lifetime.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当我试着向你解释这内我的本质时，我多少处在同样的地位，因为你虽能变得在梦中知觉到内我，你是不能真正赏识它的成熟或能力的。但它们却是你的，就跟那大人的能力属于那小孩一样。在梦境里，你除了学其他的事之外，你还学着如何建构你自己日复一日的物质实相，正如在死后，你学着如何建构你下一个具体的一生。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:07.) In dreams you solve the problems. In the daytime you are (only) consciously aware of the methods of problem solving that you learned in sleep. In dreams you set your goals, as after death you set the goals for another incarnation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:07)在梦中你解决问题。在日间你(只)是有意识地知觉到你在睡眠中所学到的解决问题的方法。在梦中你定下目标，正如死后你定下下一生的目标。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, no psychological structure is easy to describe in words. Simply to explain the nature of personality as it is generally known, all kinds of terms are used: id, subconscious, ego, superego; all of these to differentiate the interweaving actions that make up the physical personality. The dreaming self is just as complicated. So you can say that certain portions of it deal with physical reality, physical manipulation, and plans; some with deeper levels of creativity and achievement that insure physical survival; some with communication, with even more extensive elements of the personality now generally unknown; some with the continuing experience and existence of what you may call the soul or overall individual entity, the true multidimensional self.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>且说，没有一样心理结构是容易以言语来形容的。只为了要解释一般所知的“人性”，就用到了各种各类的术语：原欲(id)、潜意识、自我、超我；所有这些都用来区分组成具体人格互相交织的活动。作梦的自己是同样的复杂。因此你可说它的某个部分处理物质实相、具体的操纵与计划；某部分处理保证肉身存活更深层面的创造性与成就；有部分处理沟通，而与现在一般尚不知的人格更广博的成分打交道；有些处理你可称为“灵魂”或“整体的个人存有”，那个真正多次元自己的持续经验与存在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The soul creates the flesh. The creator hardly looks down upon its creation. The soul creates the flesh for a reason, and physical existence for a reason, so none of this is to lead you to a distaste for physical life, nor toward a lack of appreciation for those sensual joys with which you are surrounded. Any inner journeys should allow you to find greater significance, beauty, and meaning in life as you know it now; but full enjoyment and development also means that you use all of your abilities, that you explore inner dimensions with as much wonder and enthusiasm. With proper understanding, therefore, it is quite possible for you to become quite familiar now with after-death landscapes and environments and experiences. You will find them to be as vivid as any you know. Such explorations will completely alter somber preconceptions about existence after death. It is very important that you divest yourself of as many preconceptions as possible, however, for these will impede your progress.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>灵魂创造肉身，而创造者很少会鄙视他的作品。灵魂创造肉体有其道理，创造具体的人生也有其道理，因此这些都不是要导致你厌恶世俗生活，也不是要使你对那些围绕着你的感官之乐无动于衷。任何内在的旅程应让你在现在所知的生活中，发现更大的重要性、美和意义；但完全的享受和发展也是指，用到你所有的能力，以同样多的惊奇与热忱去探索内在的次元。所以，有了正确的了解，你现在便很可能对死后的景象、环境与经验变得颇为熟悉。你会发现它们与任何你已知的世界一样栩栩如生。此种探索将完全改变你们先入为主对于死后存在的阴郁看法。不过，你尽可能地舍弃掉偏见是很重要的，因为他们会阻碍你的进程。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take a short break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:23 to 10:39.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:23—10:39。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Generally speaking, if you are fairly content about physical reality, you are in a better position to study these inner environments.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>一般说来，如果你对物质实相相当的满意，你就比较适合研究这些内在环境。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If you see evil all about you in physical life, and if it seems to outweigh the good, then you are not ready. You should not embark upon an exploration of these nightly adventures if you are depressed, for at this time your own psychic state is predisposed toward depressing experiences, whether awake or asleep. You should not embark upon such a study if you hope to substitute inner experience for physical experience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你在生活中处处看到邪恶，如果它似乎多过了善良，那么你还没准备好。如果你心情沮丧，你就不该开始这些夜间的探索，因为在此时，不论你是醒是睡，你的心灵状态都容易感受抑郁的经验。如果你希望以内在经验来代替实际经验，你也不该开始这种研究。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If your ideas of good and evil are rigorous, unbending, then you do not have the understanding that is necessary for any conscious manipulation in this other dimension. In other words, you should be as flexible mentally, psychologically, and spiritually as possible, open to new ideas, creative, and not overly dependent upon organizations or dogma.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你对善与恶的观念是严酷的、无法转圜的，那么你还没有具备在这另外的次元中，从事任何有意识的操纵所必需的了解。换言之，在精神上、心理上、心灵上你应尽可能地有弹性，对新的概念创造开放，而不过分依赖组织或教条。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You should be fairly competent and sympathetic. At the same time you should be outgoing enough in your physical environment so that you are capable of handling your life as it is. You need all your resources. This is to be an active exploration and endeavor, not a passive withdrawal, and certainly not a cowardly retreat. Toward the end of this book, methods will be given for those who are interested so that you can explore these after-death conditions consciously, having some control over your experiences and progress.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你应是相当能干与富同情心的。同时在你的物质环境里，你应该是够外向到足以处理你现在的生活。你需要你所有的资源，因为这将是一个积极的探索和努力，而非消极的退缩，更必然不是懦弱的撤退。此书将近尾声时，会给那些有兴趣的人一些方法，以使你能有意识地探索这些死后的情况，同时对你的经验与进度能控制得住。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Here, however, I want to describe these conditions somewhat more thoroughly. Now, in physical life you see what you want to see. You perceive from the available field of reality certain data ---- data selected carefully by you in accordance with your ideas of what reality is. You create the data to begin with.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，此地我想多少更透澈地描写一下这些情况。在物质生活中，你其实是看到你所想看到的东西，由可用的实相范围你感知某些资料——按照你对实相是什么的概念，而由你精心选择的资料。那些资料本来就是你创造出来的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If you believe all men are evil, you simply will not experience the goodness in men. You will be completely closed to it. They in turn will always show you their worst side. You will telepathically see to it that others dislike you, and you will project your dislike upon them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你相信人性本恶，你就不会体验到人的善良。你对它完全关闭。他们于是将永远对你表现出最坏的一面。当你认为别人不喜欢你时，你会心电感应式地使这事必然发生，而你也将把你的不喜欢投射到他们身上。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:54.) Your experience, in other words, follows your expectations. Now the same applies to after-death experience and to the dream experience, and to any out-of-body encounters. If you are obsessed with the idea of evil, then you will meet evil conditions. If you believe in devils, then you will encounter these. As I mentioned earlier, there is greater freedom when consciousness is not physically directed. Thoughts and feelings are constructed, again, into reality without the physical time lapse. So if you believe you will be met by a demon, you will create your own thought form of one, not realizing that it is of your own creation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:54)换言之，你的经验跟随着你的期望走。在死后与梦中经验以及任何“出体”的遭遇中，这个原则也适用。如果你执迷于恶的概念，那你就会碰上恶的情况。如果你相信魔鬼，那你就会碰见它。如我先前提过的，当意识不是针对着肉体时，它有更大的自由。再说一次，思想和感情不需经过时间的流逝就建构为实相。因此如果你相信自己会遇上一个恶魔，你就会创造出这样的一个“心念形相”来，却不知它乃是你自己的创造物。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Therefore, if you find yourself concentrating upon the evils of physical existence in such a manner, then you are not ready for such explorations. It is, of course, possible under such conditions to meet a thought form belonging to someone else, but if you do not believe in demons to begin with, you will always recognize the nature of the phenomena and be unharmed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，如果你发现自己正以这种方式专注于肉体生活的邪恶上，那么你还没准备好去作这种探索。当然，是可能在这种情况下碰上属于另一个人的“心念形相”的，但若你本来就不相信恶魔，你总会认识这现象的本质而不受其害。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If it is your own thought form, then, in fact, you may learn from it by asking yourself what it represents, what problem that you have so materialized. Now you may hallucinate the same sort of thing after death, use it for a symbol, and undergo a spiritual battle of sorts that would, of course, not be necessary had you more understanding. You will work out your ideas, problems or dilemmas at your own level of understanding.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果那是你自己的心念形相，那么，事实上，借着问自己它代表着什么、你把什么问题这样子具体化了，你还可以从它那儿学到点东西。你在死后也可能幻觉到同类的东西，把它用为一个象征，而经历某种天人之战。当然，那是不必要的，如果你有更多了解的话。你将在自己的理解层次，解决自己的概念、难题或两难之局。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: End of dictation for the evening. Unless you have questions, I will end the session.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在，结束今晚的听写，我将结束此节，除非你有问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Do you know what I said to Jane yesterday ---- about our going on tour to promote The Seth Material? Do you have any thoughts on this?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“你知不知道昨天我跟珍说什么——有关我们周游促销《灵界的讯息》的事？你对此有任何意见吗？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I will discuss it at a later date.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这点我以后再讨论。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Okay.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好吧”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Not too late a date. My heartiest wishes then, and a fond good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不会在太久以后。那么我最衷心的祝福，并祝晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth. It’s been very interesting.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“晚安赛斯。今晚讲得很有趣。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I hope to keep you interested in my saga.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我希望使你继续对我的冒险故事感兴趣。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:02 P.M. Jane’s trance had been good. “He’s got the whole rest of that chapter planned,” she said when she came out of it. “I can sense whole blocks of material all ready. But now, it starts to fade, to go….”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:02。珍的出神状态曾很深。“他已把那章所有剩下的部分计划好了，”当她出来时，她说，“我能感觉到整段整段资料全预备好了。但现在，它开始褪色，走了……”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(As it turned out, we didn’t ask Seth about promotion work again, and he didn’t bring up the subject himself. The Seth Material was published in September, 1970, and we did go on tour.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(结果，我们没再问赛斯有关促销工作的事，他自己也没再提此事。《灵界的讯息》于1970年9月出版，我们是曾周游促销。)</a>
