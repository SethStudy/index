<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 511,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第511节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>JANUARY 21, 1970, 9:10 P.M. WEDNESDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1970年1月21日 星期三 晚上9：10</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(In beginning these notes, let me mention that there are certain definite changes in Jane when she is in trance and speaking for Seth.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在开始这些笔记之前，我提一下珍在出神状态替赛斯代言的时候，她本身有某些明确的改变。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Usually Jane goes in and out of trance with remarkable speed. Her eyes aren’t closed during sessions, except for relatively brief periods ---- but they can be barely open, say, or half open, or wide open and much darker than usual. She sits for sessions in her Kennedy rocker, but on occasion she gets up and moves about. She smokes in trance and sips a little wine, beer, or coffee. Sometimes, when her trance has been very deep, it takes her a few minutes “to really come out of it,” as she puts it. Almost always she joins me in a snack after the session, no matter how late it is.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(通常珍出入出神状态的速度惊人。她在课中一直睁着双眼，只有几次闭上但时间相当短——有时瞇成一条缝，或者说半睁半闭，有时完全睁开而且眼珠颜色比平时幽深很多。她多半坐在她的甘乃迪摇椅里上课，但偶尔也会站起来走动。在出神状态中，她吸烟，也喝一点葡萄酒、啤酒或咖啡。有时她的出神状态非常深，她说她需要几分钟才会“真正回过神来”。在赛斯课后，不管多晚，她几乎每次都会跟我一起吃宵夜。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane’s voice in trance can be almost conversational in tone, volume, and pace, but is subject to a wide range of these qualities. Usually it’s somewhat deeper and stronger than her “own” voice. Once in a while her “Seth voice” is very loud indeed, much more powerful, with definite masculine overtones and with an obvious, tremendous energy behind it. Most of our sessions however are fairly quiet.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(她在出神状态说话的调子、音量与快慢，几乎就像聊天那样，但一定都有以下这些特质。通常比她“自己的”声音来得低沉有力一些。偶尔她的“赛斯之声”的确非常响亮，而且有力得多，还带着明确的男性泛音，而且背后有明显、巨大的能量。不过我们大多数的课是相当安静的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth speaks with an accent that’s hard to pinpoint. It’s been called Russian, Irish, German, Dutch, Italian, and even French. Seth once humorously commented that his way of speaking was actually due to his own “cosmopolitan background,” acquired through many lifetimes. Jane and I think it is simply individual, and that it invokes various responses in people according to their own ethnic and emotional backgrounds.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯说话带有一种难以确定的口音。有人说那是俄国、爱尔兰、德国、荷兰、意大利、甚至法国的腔调。有一回赛斯幽默地说，他说话的方式事实上是累世“四海为家的背景”所致。珍和我认为口音纯属个人，听的人基于各自的种族和感情背景，而有各种不同的反应。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(There are two more effects that Jane always manifests while she is in trance. One is a more angular quality in her mannerisms. The other is a rearrangement of her facial muscles; a tautness resulting, I believe, from an infusion of energy ---- or of consciousness. At times this effect is quite pronounced, and I can easily sense the immediacy of Seth’s presence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍在出神的时候几乎一定会显现的效果还有两种。一是她的举止比较生硬，二是她脸部肌肉重组而显出一种紧绷的样子，我相信那是一股能量或意识注入造成的结果。有时候这种效果十分突出，赛斯一在场，我很容易就感觉得到。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I think these changes in Jane during sessions are caused by her creative reception of a portion of an entity, an essence, that we call Seth, and by her own ideas of what this certain segment is like as she casts it in the masculine gender. Her transformation as Seth is original, and absorbing to watch and participate in. Regardless of degree, Seth is uniquely and kindly present. I am listening to, and exchanging dialogue with, another personality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我想珍在课中之所以有这些改变，一方面是因为她以独创的方式，接收我们称为赛斯的一个存有(entity)、一个原素(essence)的一部分；另一方面也是因为她在选定男性担当这一个部分时，对于它应该是什么样子所抱持的想法。她转变成赛斯的方式很有原创性，在旁边看和参与其中都有趣极了。不论程度如何，赛斯在场总是风格独具又和蔼可亲。我是在倾听另一个“人”，并与之交谈。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Before the session, Jane said she felt rather nervous; she thought Seth would start his own book this evening. Her feeling of nervousness is quite unusual in these sessions. I offered reassurances, telling her to forget the whole thing and let the book come out in its own way.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在这一节开始之前，珍说她感觉相当紧张；她认为赛斯今晚会开始他自己的书。她在这些课觉得紧张，相当不寻常。我一再叫她放心，叫她忘了这整件事，让这本书按它自己的方式出来就成了。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: I bid you, Joseph, a good evening</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，约瑟，我向你道晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Our friend Ruburt does indeed have stage fright, and to some extent this is understandable, so I bear with him.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们的朋友鲁柏的确觉得怯场，这多少是可以了解的，因此我容忍他。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>However, let us begin with Chapter One. (Smile.) Ruburt may write an introduction if he likes. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不管怎样，我们开始第一章吧。(微笑。)鲁柏喜欢的话可以写篇序啊。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: You have heard of ghost hunters. I can quite literally be called a ghost writer, though I do not approve of the term “ghost.” It is true that I am usually not seen in physical terms. I do not like the word “spirit,” either; and yet if your definition of that word implies the idea of a personality without a physical body, then I would have to agree that the description fits me.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，你们听说过抓鬼人(ghost hunter)，那我可说是名副其实的捉刀鬼(ghost writer)，虽然我不赞同“鬼”这个名词。你们通常确实是看不见我的形体。我也不喜欢“幽灵”(spirit)这个字；不过，如果你们对那个字的定义含有“一个没有肉体的人格(personality)”这个概念在里面，那我就不得不同意这样的描述适合我。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I address an unseen audience. However, I know that my readers exist, and therefore I shall ask each of them, now, to grant me the same privilege.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我在对一群看不见的听众讲话。但是，我知道我的读者是存在的，因此，我要求他们每个人，现在呢，也认可我的存在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I write this book through the auspices of a woman of whom I have become quite fond. To others it seems strange that I address her as “Ruburt,” and “him,” but the fact is that I have known her in other times and places, by other names. She has been both a man and a woman, and the entire identity who has lived these separate lives can be designated by the name of Ruburt.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我写这本书多亏一位女性的支持，我变得十分喜欢她。对别人来说，我用“鲁柏”和“他”来称呼她似乎有点怪，但是，我其实在别的时间与地点，早就认识有别的名字的她。她曾经做过男人也做过女人，“鲁柏”这个名字可以代表那个曾经活过这些个别人生的整个本体(entire identity)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Names are not important, however. My name is Seth. Names are simply designations, symbols; and yet since you must use them, I shall also. I write this book with the cooperation of Ruburt, who speaks the words for me. In this life Ruburt is called Jane, and her husband, Robert Butts, takes down the words that Jane speaks. I call him Joseph.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，名字并不重要。我的名字是赛斯。名字只是称谓、象征而已；但是，既然你们一定要用，我也就从善如流。我和鲁柏合作写这本书，他替我说话。在这一世，鲁柏的名字是珍，她的先生罗伯·柏兹写下珍说的话，我叫他约瑟。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>My readers may suppose that they are physical creatures, bound within physical bodies, imprisoned within bone, flesh, and skin. If you believe that your existence is dependent upon this corporeal image, then you feel in danger of extinction, for no physical form lasts, and no body, however beautiful in youth, retains the same vigor and enchantment in old age. If you identify with your own youth, or beauty, or intellect, or accomplishments, then there is the constant gnawing knowledge that these attributes can and will vanish.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我的读者可能以为他们自己是有形的生物，被肉身束缚，囚禁于骨、肉和皮肤里。如果你们相信你们的存在要靠这种肉体形象，那你们就会觉得自己有灭绝之虞，因为肉体无法长存，不论在年轻时有多美，没有一个身体到了老年还能保有同样的精力和魅力。如果你认为自己等同于青春、美丽、聪明或成就，那种明知道这些属性一定会消失却又难以释怀的感觉就会一直在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I am writing this book to assure you that this is not the case. Basically you are no more of a physical being than I am, and I have donned and discarded more bodies than I care to tell. Personalities who do not exist do not write books. I am quite independent of a physical image, and so are you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我写这本书就是为了向你们保证事实并非如此。基本上，你们的存在并不会因为有肉身就比我来得真实，我穿过又丢弃过的肉身太多了，我连说都懒得说。不存在的人不能写书。我不需要依赖肉体形象，你们也一样。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Consciousness creates form. It is not the other way around. All personalities are not physical. It is only because you are so busily concerned with daily matter that you do not realize that there is a portion of you who knows that its own powers are far superior to those shown by the ordinary self.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>意识创造形相，而不是反过来。并非所有的人格都有形体，只因为你们太忙着关注日常事务，而没有发觉，有一部分的你知道它自己的力量远比平常的自己表现出来的力量大多了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You have each lived other existences, and that knowledge is within you though you are not consciously aware of it. I hope that this book will serve to release the deeply intuitive self within each of my readers, and to bring to the foreground of consciousness whatever particular insights will serve you most.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你们每个人都曾有过其他的生命，虽然意识上你们对此毫不知情，但内在却很明白。我希望这本书会让我的每一个读者释放他们内在那个极为直觉的自己，并且把对你最有用的任何一个洞见带到意识的最前端。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As I begin this book it is late January, in your time, 1970. Ruburt is a slim, dark-haired, quick woman now, who sits in a rocker and speaks these words for me.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>按你们的时间来说，我是在1970年的1月底开始这本书。鲁柏是个纤细、黑发、敏捷的女子，她坐在摇椅里替我说这些话。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause at 9:35.) My consciousness is fairly well focused within Ruburt’s body. It is a cold night. This is our first experience in writing a complete book in trance, and Ruburt was somewhat nervous before the session began. It is not just a simple matter of having this woman speak for me. There are many manipulations necessary, and psychological adjustments. We have established what I refer to as a psychological bridge between us ---- that is, between Ruburt and myself.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:35停了很久。)我的意识焦点相当清楚地对准鲁柏的身体。今晚很冷。这是我们头一次在出神状态写一本完整的书，鲁柏在课前有点紧张。这件事并不只是让这女人替我讲话这么简单，其中还有很多必要的操纵和心理的调适。在我们——也就是鲁柏和我——之间，我们已经建立了一座我所谓的“心里桥梁”(psychological bridge)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I do not speak through Ruburt as one might through a telephone. Instead there is a psychological extension, a projection of characteristics on both of our parts, and this I use for our communications. Later I will explain how this psychological framework is created and maintained, for it is like a road that must be kept clear of debris.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我透过鲁柏说话跟讲电话是不一样的。事实上，我们双方都有一种心理的延伸，一种特性的投射，我就是利用这种延伸和投射来沟通。以后我会解释这种心理架构是如何创造与维护的，因为它就像一条路，一定要保持干净而没有残砾。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You would be much better off in reading this book if you asked yourself who you are, rather than asked who I am, for you cannot understand what I am unless you understand the nature of personality and the characteristics of consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>读这本书的时候，如果你问自己你是谁，比起问我是谁要好得多。因为你若不了解人格的本质以及意识的特性，你就不能了解我是什么。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If you believe firmly that your consciousness is locked up somewhere inside your skull and is powerless to escape it, if you feel that your consciousness ends at the boundary of your body, then you sell yourself short, and you will think that I am a delusion. I am no more a delusion than you are, and that may be a loaded sentence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你坚信你的意识被锁在你头颅内的某处而无力逃逸，如果你觉得你的意识只局限在你的身体内，那么你就是太小看自己了，还会以为我只是个幻觉。我不比你更是个幻觉，这句话中自有深意。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I can say this to each of my readers honestly (smile): I am older than you are, at least in terms of age as you think of it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我可以老实跟你们每个读者说(微笑)：我比你老，至少以你们认为的年龄来说。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If a writer can qualify as any kind of authority on the basis of age, therefore, then I should get a medal. I am an energy personality essence, no longer focused in physical matter. As such, I am aware of some truths that many of you seem to have forgotten.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，如果一个作者能靠年龄来取得权威资格的话，那我应当得一个奖章。我是一个不再聚焦于物质界的“以能量为体性的人格”(energy personality essence)，正因如此，我能知觉你们许多人似已忘怀的一些真理。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I hope to remind you of these. I do not speak so much to the part of you that you think of as yourself as to that part of you that you do not know, that you have to some extent denied and to some extent forgotten. That part of you reads this book, [even] as “you” read it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我希望提醒你们这些真理。我不是对你自以为是“你自己”的那个部分讲话，而毋宁是对你所不知的、你在某程度加以否认、并且在某程度遗忘了的那个部分讲话。〔即使〕当“你”在读这本书时，也是你的那个部分在读它。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I speak to those who believe in a god, and those who do not, to those who believe that science will find all answers as to the nature of reality, and to those who do not. I hope to give you clues that will enable you to study the nature of reality for yourself as you have never studied it before.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我对那些信神与不信神的人讲话，对那些相信科学会找到有关实相性质的所有答案，或不相信的人讲话。我希望给你们线索，使你们能够前所未有地亲自研究实相的性质。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are several things that I shall ask you to understand. You are not stuck in time like a fly in a closed bottle, whose wings are therefore useless. You cannot trust your physical senses to give you a true picture of reality. They are lovely liars, with such a fantastic tale to tell that you believe it without question. You are sometimes wiser, more creative, and far more knowledgeable when you are dreaming than when you are awake.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有几样事我要让你们了解。你们并没有被困在时间里，像一只封在瓶里的苍蝇，翅膀因而无用武之地。你们不能靠肉体的感官来给你实相的真实画面。五官是可爱的大骗子，说了一个这么天花乱坠的故事，骗得你们对它确信无疑。你们有时在作梦时比在醒时更聪明、更有创造力，并且知识也丰富得多。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>These statements may seem highly dubious to you now, but when we are finished I hope that you will see that they are plain statements of fact.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在这些说法在你们看来可能极为可疑，但当我们讲完这本书以后，我希望你们会明白它们只是对事实的直陈而已。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>What I will tell you has been told before throughout the centuries, and given again when it was forgotten. I hope to clarify many points that have been distorted through the years. And I offer my original interpretation of others, for no knowledge exists in a vacuum, and all information must be interpreted and colored by the personality who holds it and passes it on. Therefore I describe reality as I know it, and my experience in many layers and dimensions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我将告诉你们的，世代以来都有人讲过，而当它被遗忘了就会再说一遍。我希望澄清多年来被曲解的许多观点，而对其他的观点我会给予我原创性的诠释，因为知识并非存在于真空，所有的资料必然被持有者和传递者诠释而沾染上他们的特性。因此我仅就我所知，根据我在许多层面和次元的经验来描述实相。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This is not to say that other realities do not exist. I have been conscious before your earth was formed. To write this book ---- and in most of my communications with Ruburt ---- I adopt from my own bank of past personalities those characteristics that seem appropriate. There are many of us, personalities like myself, unfocused in physical matter or time. Our existence seems strange to you only because you do not realize the true potentials of personality, and you are hypnotized by your own limited concepts.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这并不是说其它的实相就不存在。在你们的地球形成之前我就有意识了。在写这本书时——及在大多数我与鲁柏沟通时——我从自己过去的人格银行里提用了那些好像适当的特性。有许多像我这样的“人”格，不把焦点集中在物质或时间上。我们的存在在你们看来很陌生，因为你们不了解人格的真正潜能，而被你们自己有限的观念催眠了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause, then humorously): You may take a break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(停一下，然后幽默地说：)你们可以休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Thank you.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“谢谢你。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:18. Jane left trance rather easily, although it had been a good one. She was quite surprised that so much time had passed. She was also much relieved that Seth had started the book, while keeping her well under. “Oh, he’s smart,” she laughed. “Somebody’s pretty tricky.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:18。珍相当从容地脱离出神状态，虽然那是个很深的出神状态。她很惊讶时间已过了这么久。她也对赛斯趁她在深度出神时开始了这本书松了一口气。“哦，他很聪明，”她笑道，“有人挺诈的哟！”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth resumed his book at 10:34.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯在10:34继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I am primarily a teacher, but I have not been a man of letters per se. I am primarily a personality with a message: you create the world that you know. You have been given perhaps the most awesome gift of all: the ability to project your thoughts outward into physical form.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我主要是个老师，但我本身并非文学家。我主要是个带信息来的人，我的信息是：你们创造了你们认识的世界。天赋予你们的也许是最可敬畏的礼物：将你们的思想向外投射成为具体物质的能力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The gift brings a responsibility, and many of you are tempted to congratulate yourselves on the successes of your lives, and blame God, fate, and society for your failures. In like manner, mankind has a tendency to project his own guilt and his own errors upon a father-god image, who it seems must grow weary of so many complaints.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这礼物附带了责任，但你们多半喜欢对生活中的成功自我庆贺，而将失败归罪于上帝、命运或社会。同样地，人类有一种倾向，喜欢把自己的罪过投射在一个“老天爷”的形象上，看来衪对这么多抱怨一定厌烦透了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The fact is that each of you create your own physical reality; and en masse, you create both the glories and the terrors that exist within your earthly experience. Until you realize that you are the creators, you will refuse to accept this responsibility. Nor can you blame a devil for the world’s misfortunes. You have grown sophisticated enough to realize that the Devil is a projection of your own psyche, but you have not grown wise enough to learn how to use your creativity constructively.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>事实是，你们每一个人创造自己的物质实相；而集体地，你们创造了你们俗世经验里的光荣与恐怖。你们会拒绝接受这责任，直到你了悟你们即创造者！你们也不能把世上的不幸怪罪于魔鬼。你们已经成熟到能明白，魔鬼是你们自己心灵的投射，但你们还没聪明到学会如何建设性地利用你们的创造力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Most of my readers are familiar with the term, “muscle bound.” As a species you have grown “ego bound” instead, held in a spiritual rigidity, with the intuitive portions of the self either denied or distorted beyond any recognition.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我大多数的读者都知道“肌肉失去弹性”这事，做为一个种族，你们其实是“自我失去弹性”，受制于一种精神的僵化死板中，自身那直觉的部分不是被否认便是被扭曲到不可辨认。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:45.) The hour is growing late. Both of my friends must get up early in the morning. Ruburt is working on two books of his own and must get his sleep. Before I end this session I ask you to imagine our setting, for Ruburt has told me that a writer must be careful to set the scene. (Humorously.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:45停顿。)时间渐渐晚了，我的两位朋友明天都得早起。鲁柏正在写两本他自己的书，必须睡够。在我结束这一节前，我请你们想象我们的布景，因为鲁柏曾告诉我，一个作者必须小心地布置场景(幽默地)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I speak through Ruburt twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays, in this same large (living) room. The lights are always lit. This evening it is enjoyable for me to look out through Ruburt’s eyes at the wintry corner beyond.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>每周一和周三我透过鲁柏讲话，在这同一间大客厅里，灯总是开着。今晚我很欣赏由鲁柏的眼看到的外面一角冬日景色。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Physical reality has always been refreshing to me, and through Ruburt’s cooperation and as I write this book, I see that I was correct in appreciating its unique charms. There is one other character to be mentioned here: Willy, the cat, a beloved monster who is now sleeping.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>物质实相总令我心神爽快，而经由鲁柏的合作，当我写这本书的时候，我明白我欣赏它的独特魅力是有道理的。这里还应该提到另一个角色：猫咪威立，一个正在睡觉的可爱怪物。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Willy was sleeping ---- snoring, actually ---- on top of our old-fashioned TV set. His position put him just in back of Jane’s head as she sat in her rocker.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(威立正在我们老式的电视机上睡觉——事实上是在打鼾。它的位置刚好在珍的摇椅后方。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The nature of animal consciousness in itself is a highly interesting subject, and one that we will later consider. The cat is aware of my presence, and has on several occasions reacted rather noticeably to it. In this book I hope to show the constant interactions that occur between all units of consciousness, the communication that leaps beyond the barriers of species; and in some of these discussions, we will use Willy as a case in point.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>动物意识的本质本身就是个非常有趣的题目，我们以后会谈到。这猫知觉到我的在场，好几次曾有相当显著的反应。在这本书里头我希望让你们看到，所有意识单位之间不断发生的交互作用，以及跨越族类障碍的沟通；在这类讨论中，有几次我们会拿威立当现成的例子。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take a break or end the session as you prefer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一会儿或结束此节，随你便。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Okay, then we’ll end it, I guess.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好，那我想，我们就此结束吧。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>My heartiest wishes to you both.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>给你们两位我最衷心的祝福。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“It’s very interesting.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“这节很有趣。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause, and smile.) I hope you enjoy it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(停顿，微笑：)我希望你们喜欢。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good night, Seth.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:00 P.M. Jane was out of trance quickly. Her pace had been good throughout the session. She said she was glad Seth had begun work on his book. “For ages in the past,” she said, “whenever I thought Seth wanted to start the book, I was afraid to let him do it.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:00。珍很快地回过神来。整节她的速度都很好。她说她很高兴赛斯已开始他的书了。她说：“好久以来，每当我认为赛斯想要开始写书时，我都不敢让他去做。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane wondered now about reading the book as Seth produced it. It might be impressive to say that she didn’t see the script until it was finished. We decided that it didn’t matter whether she did or not, though, so she will read this material when I finish typing it up.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍在想要不要在赛斯写作时阅读此书。如果说她等到原稿完成之后才看到，听起来是很了不起啦。但我们判定她看不看都没关系，所以当我打好字后她就会看这资料。)</a>
