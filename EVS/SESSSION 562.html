<div style="display:inline">(遵照赛斯11月25日的建议，我们在公寓后侧我的画室里举行赛斯课，在那儿比较隐密却没那么暖和；尤其是当门关着时。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Following Seth’s suggestion of November 25, we held the session in my studio, at the back of our apartment. It’s more private there but it isn’t as warm, especially when doors are closed.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们要继续口述，并且开始下一章。这章名为〈转世的文明、可能性、再谈多次元的神〉。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: We will resume dictation, and we will begin with the next chapter. It will be called: “reincarnational Civilizations, Probabilities, and More on the Multidimensional God.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">就某一方面来说，你们可说有转世的文明，就像有转世的个人一样。每个得成肉身的本体都在努力发展那些在物质环境中最能被滋育和成就的能力。他对他每次生存于其中的文明有其责任，因为他经由他自己的思想、情感和行动助成了这个文明。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In a manner of speaking, it can be said that you have reincarnational civilizations as well as reincarnating individuals. Each entity who is born in flesh works toward the development of those abilities that can be best nurtured and fulfilled within the physical environment. He has a responsibility to and for the civilization in which he has each existence, for he helps form it through his own thoughts, emotions, and actions.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他由成功中学习，也由失败中学习。你以为实质的历史是自穴居人开始一直继续到现在，但还曾有过其他伟大的科学文明；有些在传奇中言及，有些完全不为人知——但以你们的话来说，现在全都消逝了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>He learns from failure as well as success. You think of physical history as beginning with the caveman and continuing up to the present, but there have been other great scientific civilizations; some spoken of in legend, some completely unknown ---- all in your terms now vanished.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在你们看来，你们作为人类仿佛只有一次的机会，来解决你们的问题，或被你们自己的侵略性、被你们自己的欠缺了解和灵性所消灭。就像你被赐予了许多次生命来发展与完成你的能力，同样的，给予过整个人类的也不只是你们现在所熟悉的这一个单线历史发展。转世的结构只不过是可能性这一整幅画的一个面而已。在其中你拥有所有你需要的时间，以发展那些在你离开轮回以前，所必须发展的能力。一批又一批的人们在各个不同的转世活动周期里，遭遇过一次又一次的危机，达到过你们的物质发展水准，而他们不是超越了此点，就是毁灭了他们那个特定的文明。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It seems to you that you have, perhaps, but one chance as a species to solve your problems, or be destroyed by your own aggression, by your own lack of understanding and spirituality. As you are given many lives in which to develop and fulfill your abilities, so has the species in those terms been allotted more than the single line of historical development with which you are presently acquainted. The reincarnational structure is but one facet in the whole picture of Probabilities. In it you have literally as much time as you need, to develop those potentials that you must develop, before leaving the reincarnational existences. Groups of people in various cycles of reincarnational activity have met crisis after crisis, have come to your point of physical development and either gone beyond it, or destroyed their particular civilization.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在这情形，他们被给予了另一次机会，他们不只在无意识层面知道他们的失败，并且也知道其背后的原因。于是他们在形成新的原始集团时，在心理上会比别人的领先一步。其他那些解决了问题的人类，离开了你们的地球而到物质宇宙的其他点去了。不过，当他们达到那种发展水准时，他们在精神上与心灵上都已臻成熟，而能利用你们现在对之一无所知的能量。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In this case they were given another chance, having the unconscious knowledge not only of their failure, but the reasons behind it. They then began with a psychological head start as they formed new primitive groupings. Others, solving the problems, left your physical planet for other points in the physical universe. When they reached that level of development, however, they were spiritually and psychically mature, and were able to utilize energies of which you now have no practical knowledge.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在9:22停顿。)地球对他们来说是传说中的老家。他们形成了新的种族和人类，在身体上已不能适应你们的大气状况。不过，只要他们一天居住于物质的实相，他们便还在轮回中。可是，这些人中有一部分发生了突变而早已离开轮回了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 9:22.) Earth to them now is the legendary home. They formed new races and species that could no longer physically accommodate themselves to your atmospheric conditions. However, they also continued on the reincarnational level as long as they inhabited physical reality. Some of these have mutated and have long left the reincarnational cycle, however.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那些已离开轮回的，已进化到他们原来就是的“精神体”，你懂吗？他们已抛弃了物质形体。这一群本体对地球仍有很大的兴趣，他们给它支持和能量。在某方面来说，他们也可被认为是地球的神明(earth gods)。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Those who have left it have evolved into themental entities that they always were, you see. They have discarded material form. This group of entities still takes a great interest in earth. They lend it support and energy. In a way, they could be thought of now as earth gods.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:28)在你们的行星上，他们曾涉及在亚特兰蒂斯之前很久的三个特定文明；那时，你们的行星本身，事实上是在一个与今天有些不同的位置上。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:28.) On your planet they were involved in three particular civilizations long before the time of Atlantis; when, in fact, your planet itself was in a somewhat different position.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“你是指一个不同的‘运行轨道’吗？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Do you mean a different ‘orbit’?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">目前暂且用“位置”这个字。尤其是对你们所知的三个其他行星的关系而言。地球的两极倒反了过来——顺便一提，在你们行星的历史中有三段长时期是如此。这些文明都是高科技的；事实上，第二个文明在那方面比你们自己的要高明得多了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>For now, leave the word “position.” Particularly in relationship to three of the other planets that you know. The poles were reversed ---- as they were, incidentally, for three long periods of your planet’s history. These civilizations were highly technological; the second one being, in fact, far superior to your own along those lines.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">“声音”受到有效得多的利用，不但是在医疗上或战争中，还被用来作为车辆的动力，用来运送物体。声音用来运送笨重巨大的东西。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Sound was utilized far more effectively, not only for healing and in wars, but also to power vehicles of locomotion, and to bring about the movement of physical matter. Sound was a conveyor of weight and mass.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:34。当珍说到上面“战争”这字时，她的语调和面部表情有一种“你想不到吧”的意味。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:34. When Jane spoke the word “wars,” above, her tone of voice and her facial expression had a “wouldn’t you know it” connotation.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这第二个文明的势力范围主要是落在现在所谓的非洲与澳洲，虽然在那时不但气候完全不同，陆地的分布亦然。因着南北极位置的改变，大片陆块由于不同的引力而有不同的分布。不过，大致说来，这文明集中于某地区，它并未企图扩展。它是非常向内发展的，与一个大而无组织、散居各处的原始文明同时共存于这行星上。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The strength of this second civilization lay mainly in the areas now known as Africa and Australia, although at that time not only was the climate entirely different, but the land areas. There was a different attraction of land mass having to do with the altered position of the poles. Relatively speaking, however, the civilization was concentrated in area; it did not attempt to expand. It was highly ingrown and dwelled upon the planet simultaneously with a large, unorganized, dispersed, primitive culture.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">它非但未曾企图“文明化”其余的世界，而且还尽其所能的——它的能力有一段长时期都是相当强的——阻止任何此类的进展。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Not only did it make no attempt to “civilize” the rest of the world, but it did everything in its power ---- which was considerable for a long period of time ---- to impede any such progress.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这个文明的成员大多是一个较早成功文明的边缘团体(fringe group)，那个文明的大多数人已决定继续生存于你们物质宇宙的其他地区。可是，这批人虽然可以自由地进到其他的存在层面去，他们却特别迷恋尘世生活，同时也以为他们能改进他们曾参与过的最后一次实验。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The members of this civilization were largely a fringe group from the earlier successful civilization, most of whom had decided to continue existence in other areas of your physical universe. These, however, were particularly enamored of earthly life, and also thought that they could improve upon the last experiment in which they had been involved, though they were free to move on to other layers of existence.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:42。)他们不再有兴趣像一个婴儿期文明那样从头开始，他们的兴趣在别的方面。因此他们的知识多半是本能地具备的，这个特定团体于是很快地历经你们所谓的各种科技性的阶段。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:42.) They were not interested in beginning from scratch again as an infant civilization, but in other areas. Therefore much of their knowledge was instinctive with them, and this particular group then went through what you would call the various technological stages very rapidly.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">最初他们特别关心想发展出一种人类，能有种天生固有免于“暴力”的防护装置。就他们而言，对和平的渴求几乎成了你们所谓的“本能”。身体的机能有些改变：当他们的心智发出强烈的侵略性命令时，身体不会反应。现在在心理上，你们在某些人身上还可看到这种遗迹，在他们想对别人施以暴力行为之前，他们会晕倒，甚或攻击他们自己的身体系统，因而阻止自己去施暴。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They were particularly concerned in the beginning with developing a human being who would have built-in safeguards against violence. With them, the desire for peace was almost what you would call an instinct. There were changes in the physical mechanism. When the mind signaled strong aggression, the body would not react. Now psychologically you can see vestiges of this in certain individuals, who will faint, or even attack their own physical system, before allowing themselves to do what they think of as violence to another.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此，这个文明不去干扰围绕在他们四周的土著。不过，他们确曾派出自己团体的成员去住在土人间，与之通婚，希望如此能和平地改变人种的生理。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This civilization, therefore, left the natives that surrounded them in peace. They did send out members of their own group, however, to live with the natives and intermarry, hoping peacefully to thus alter the physiology of the species.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他们把在你们的时代里被发泄为暴力的能量用在其他的追求上，但这能量开始反扑他们。他们并没学到如何应付暴力或侵略性，他们只是企图在生理上把“暴力”去掉，却发现这引起了新的纠葛。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The energy, often in your time given over to violence, went instead into other pursuits, but began to turn against them. They were not learning to deal with violence or aggression. They were attempting to short-circuit it physically, and this they found had complications.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可以休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:52—10:05)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:52 to 10:05.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">能量必须被允许自由地流过身体系统，以精神力量，或如你喜欢用心灵力量来控制与指挥。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Energy must be allowed to flow freely through the physical system, controlled and directed mentally, or psychically if you prefer.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">身体上的改变造成了对整个系统的一种压力。创造性的机能和基础被扭曲成了侵略性意念——去付诸行动的冲动——而未被了解。以某种方式来说，呼吸本身即是一种暴力。他们把抑制力预设在人身里，结果成为一个互相控制动弹不得的系统，在其中行动的必要冲刺真的变成不可能了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The physical alteration was a strain on the entire system. The creative function and basis that has been distorted into the idea of aggression ---- the urge to act ---- was not understood. In a manner of speaking, breathing itself is a violence. The built-in inhibition resulted in a tied-up system of mutual controls in which the necessary thrusting-out of action became literally impossible.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">一个过度讲究良心的、抑制性的身心状况于焉形成，在其中“人”这有机体的天然求生需要在每一方面都受到了阻碍。在精神方面这个文明很有进步，它的科技极为活跃并且在向前推进，当它努力发展诸如人造食品之类，使得它不必在任何情况下为了求生而杀害动物。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>An overly conscientious, restrictive mental and physical state evolved, in which the organism’s natural physical need for survival was in every way hampered. Mentally, the civilization progressed. Its technology was extremely activated, and propelled onward as it strove to develop, for example, artificial foods so that it would not need to kill for survival in any way.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:13)同时它试着不去破坏环境。它完全没经过你们的汽车和蒸汽发动的交通工具的阶段，而很早便集中注意力在“声音”上。这种声音是人耳所听不见的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:13.) At the same time it tried to leave the environment intact. It missed your stage of automobiles completely, and steam-driven vehicles, and concentrated rather early on sound. The sound could not be heard by physical ears.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这个文明是叫作“鲁曼尼亚”(Lumania)〔拼出字来〕，这名字本身在传奇里流传下来，而在较晚的时候又被用到。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The civilization was called Lumania, (spelled out), and the name itself went down in legend and was used again at a later time.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在肉体上“鲁曼尼亚人”是个非常瘦弱的民族，但在心灵上却是若非极有天分便是完全平庸。你知道，在有些人，预设的控制引起了在各方向能量如许的阻塞，以致他们天生的高度心电感应能力也受到了伤害。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The Lumanians were a very thin, weakly people, physically speaking, but psychically either brilliant or completely ungifted. In some, you see, the built-in controls caused so many blockages of energy in all directions that even their naturally high telepathic abilities suffered.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他们在自己文明的四周形成了能量场，因而把自己孤立于其他团体之外。可是，他们没让科技毁灭自己，而越来越多的人觉悟到这个实验并没有成功。有些人在肉体死亡之后，离开了，去加入以前那个成功文明的那些人，他们已移居到物质宇宙内的其他行星系统去了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They formed energy fields around their own civilization. They were, therefore, isolated from contact with other groups. They did not allow technology to destroy them, however. More and more of them realized that the experiment was not a success. Some, after physical death, left to join those from the previous successful civilization, who had migrated to other planetary systems within the physical structure.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，有些大的集团只是离开了他们的城市，毁掉了原先封闭着他们的力场，而加入到许多较低文明的集团里去，与他们通婚生子。这些“鲁曼尼亚人”很快就丧亡了，因为他们不能忍受暴力，也不能对之以牙还牙。不过他们感到，也许他们变种的孩子结果会较少暴力倾向，而却没有他们天生固有抑制性的“控制神经”反应。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Large groups, however, simply left their cities, destroyed the force field s that had enclosed them, and joined the many groups of relatively uncivilized peoples, mating with them and bearing children. These Lumanias died quickly, for they could not bear violence nor react to it violently. They felt however, that their mutant children might have a resulting disinclination toward violence, but without the prohibiting nerve-control reactions with which they were endowed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:24暂停一分钟。)这个文明实质上就这样灭亡了。有少数变种的后代稍后形成一个小团体，在下一世纪好像巡回者(itinerants)那样，在那一带与一大群动物结伴游荡。他们互相照应，而许多半人半兽的古老传说，就是由这些古老交织的记忆代代相传下来的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(One minute pause at 10:24.) Physically the civilization simply died out. Some few of the mutant children formed a small later group who traveled the area as itinerants in the following century, with large bands of animals. They cared for each other mutually, and many of the old legends concerning half-man and half-beast have come down through the ages simply from the memory of these old associations.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">事实上，这些人做为第一个伟大文明的遗种，内心里永远保留着对他们来源的潜意识记忆。我现在说的是鲁曼尼亚人。这乃是在科技上他们跃进得那么快的原因。但因为他们的目的是如此单纯——避免暴力——而非，好比说，建设性的和平发展创造潜能，使得他们的经验非常偏颇。他们被这样一种对暴力的恐惧所驱使，以致他们根本不敢给身体系统自由表达它的机会。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>These people, as remnants, really, of the first great civilization, always carried within themselves strong subconscious memories of their origin. I am speaking of the Lumanians now. This accounted for their quick rise, technologically speaking. But because their purpose was so single-minded ---- the avoidance of violence ---- rather, say, than the constructive peaceful development of creative potential, their experience was highly one-sided. They were driven by such a fear of violence that they dared not allow the physical system freedom even to express it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:35)这个文明的活力因此很弱——并不是因为暴力不存在，而是身体上能量与表达的自由，在某些特定路线及由外界自动地被阻隔掉了。就人间而言，他们很了解暴力的邪恶，但他们否定了个人以他自己的方式学到这一点的权利，因此阻止了个人创造性地用他自己的方法把暴力转到建设性的领域去。在这方面自由意志被放弃了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:33.) The vitality of the civilization was therefore weak ---- not because violence did not exist, but because freedom of energy and expression was automatically blocked along specific lines, and from outside physically. They well understood the evils of violence in earthly terms, but they would have denied the individual’s right to learn this his own way, and thus prevented the individual from using his own methods, creatively, to turn the violence into constructive areas. Free will in this respect was discarded.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">就如一个小孩从母亲的子宫出生之后，有一阵子他的身体对某些疾病有抵抗力，同样的在他出生后也有一段很短的时间，他被保护免受心灵上的灾害，而且也为了使他心安，他仍保有前世生活与地点的回忆。因此有好几代鲁曼尼亚人由深藏在潜意识里对过去文明的记忆所支持。但是，最后这些记忆开始减弱了。他们曾保护自己免于暴力，却非免于恐惧。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>As a child is physically protected from some diseases for a while after he emerges from his mother’s womb, so for a brief period is the child cushioned against some psychic disasters for a short period after birth, and carries within him, still for his comfort, memories of past existences and places. So the Lumanians for some generations were supported by deep subconscious memories of the civilization that had gone before. Finally, however, these began to weaken. They had protected themselves against violence but not against fear.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因而，他们得遭受所有平常的人类恐惧，并且这种恐惧还被加强了，因为在肉体上，他们即使是对大自然也不能有暴力反应。如果遭到攻击，他们必须逃跑。“打或逃”的原则并不适用。他们只有一个办法，就是“走为上策”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They were, therefore, subject to all of the ordinary human fears which were then exaggerated, since physically they could not respond even to nature with violence. If attacked, they had to flee. The fight-or-flight principle did not apply. They had but one recourse.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:41)他们的神的象征是男性——一个强大、身强力壮的男性形象，因此可以保护他们，既然他们不能保护自己。多年来他随着他们的信念而演化，在他身上，他们投射了那些他们自己无法表达的特质。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:41.) Their god symbol was a male one ---- a strong, physically powerful male figure who would therefore protect them since they could not protect themselves. He evolved through the ages as their beliefs did, and into him they projected those qualities that they could not themselves express.He was much later to appear as the old Jehovah, the God of Wrath who protected the Chosen People.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">很久之后他以老耶和华的身份出现，成为保护“选民”的“愤怒之神”。为了上述的理由，这些人对自然力的恐惧最初是极为强烈的，而在人们与滋养他们的大自然力之间造成了一种分离的感觉。他们不能信赖大地，因为他们不被许可去对抗其中的暴力而保护自己。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The fear of natural forces was, therefore, initially extremely strong in them for the reasons given, and brought about a feeling of separation between man and those natural forces that nurtured him. They could not trust the earth, since they were not allowed to protect themselves against violent forces within it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他们广博的科技和伟大的文明大半是在地下的。如此说来，他们是原始的穴居人，他们也是经由山洞才出得了他们的城市。洞穴并不只是无技艺的土人蹲在里面以求庇护的地方。它们常是通到鲁曼尼亚人城市的门户。在这些城市被弃了许久之后，后来的未开化土人找到了这些洞穴与开口。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Their vast technology and their great civilization was largely underground. They were, in those terms, the original cavemen, and they came out from their cities through caves also. Caves were not just places of protection in which unskilled natives squatted. They were often doorways to and from the cities of the Lumanians. Long after the cities were deserted, the following natives, uncivilized, found these caves and the openings.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在你们现在所谓的石器时代，那些被你们认作老祖宗的穴居人，常常不是在天然形成的粗陋山洞里，而是在洞后机械创造的甬道以及鲁曼尼亚人一度所居的被弃城市中寻求庇护所。穴居人所造的工具有些是他们找到的成品之变形仿制品而已。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In the period that you now think of as the Stone Age, the men you think of as your ancestors, the cavemen, often found shelter not in rough naturally formed caves, but in mechanically created channels that reached behind them, and in the deserted cities in which once the Lumanians dwelled. Some of the tools fashioned by the cavemen were distorted versions of those they had found.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在你们可以休息一下——加件衣服保暖。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now you may take your break ---- and keep warm.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:44。珍的步调从头到尾都相当舒缓。到现在画室已凉了不少——所以赛斯才那样说。在休息后有三张不包括在本书中的资料，课在11:25结束。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:44. Jane’s pace had been rather leisurely throughout. The studio had cooled off considerably by now ---- hence Seth’s remark. Three pages of deleted material followed break, with the session ending at 11:25 P.M.)</details><br>
