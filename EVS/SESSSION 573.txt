<a id=1 href=1>第572节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>MARCH 8, 1971, 9:40 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年3月8日 星期一 晚上9：40</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The session was late in starting because we went to the tax office after supper this evening. Jane enjoyed getting out of the house, though, and the interactions with others. She started the session at a good pace.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(这节开始得晚，因为今晚饭后，我们去了国税局。不过，珍喜欢出去走走并与人交往。她以很好的步调开始。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will resume dictation, and later I will have a few words for you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，我们将继续口述，稍晚我有几句话跟你说。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>To some extent this transmutation of symbol can be observed in various stages of waking consciousness also. When you are at rest, awake but with eyes closed, images and pictures will often appear to your inner eye. Some will be physical-like materializations, images of trees or houses or people. Others will be simply shapes that change swiftly and seem to flow one into the other. As a rule, even the images that are recognizable will quickly be replaced by others in a kaleidoscope of constantly changing forms.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>到某程度，这种“象征的变化”也可以在醒时意识的不同阶段观察到。当你在休息，眼睛闭了但醒着的时候，你的“心眼”常会看到一些形象和画面。有些会似是实质具体的东西，比如树木、人或房屋的形象。其他则仅是瞬息万变的，似乎由一个形状流入另一个形状。一般而言，甚至那些可辨认的形象也会很快地被其他的取代，像是个不断改变形状的万花筒。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There may seem to you to be no logic to these inner pictures, and certainly no connection between them and what you were thinking a moment before, or even an hour before. To some extent they seem disconnected from you and not of your doing. Often, however, they represent the characteristics shown by consciousness when it is somewhat turned away from physical stimuli. The form of symbols is changed as the states of consciousness change.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这些内在画面，可能在你看来没有什么条理，而确乎在它们与你一瞬前甚至一小时前的思想之间没什么联系。到某个程度，它们看来与你无干而且非你所为。可是，它们常常代表了当意识多多少少由世间的刺激转开时所显示的特征。当意识的状态改变，象征的形式就随之改变。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:48.) The images that you see in this circumstance represent the thoughts and feelings experienced just before you closed your eyes, or those that were paramount in your mind somewhat previously. The minute your eyes are closed, the thoughts and feelings express themselves through this symbolism. Because the images may seem to have no direct connection logically to these thoughts and feelings, you do not recognize them either as your own, nor are you able to tie them up with what they represent.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:48停顿。)在这状况下你看到影像，代表那些刚在你合眼之前所经验的，或稍早时你心中最重要的思想或感觉。你的眼睛一合上，你的思想与感觉便由这种象征方法来表达它们自己。因为这些影像看似与这些思想感觉在逻辑上没有直接关系，你认不出它们是你自己的，你也无法把它们跟它们所代表的意思连在一起。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I am putting this rather simply here. (Pause.) Imaginatively you have greater freedom to express feelings than you do practically. An earlier particular fear felt during the day involving, say, a loss of a job may then be translated when you close your eyes into a series of seemingly unrelated symbols, all however connected to that one fear.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在此我只是十分简单的讲。(停顿。)透过想象，你能比实际上更自由的表达这感觉。在白天早先所感到的某个特定的恐惧，比如说，失掉工作的恐惧，当你合上眼时可能就被转译为一串似乎不相干的象征，却无论如何全是与那一个恐惧相连的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may see in a quick series of pictures a deep hole in the ground. It may be replaced by a street urchin, obviously poor and from another century. A casket may appear, or a black wallet fly through the air. You may see a severe, dark, wintry scene. The picture of a character from an old book long forgotten may appear and disappear. In between may be a grouping of opposing symbols, representing your hope ---- a spring flower, a table loaded with food, a new suit of clothes, any sign of abundance that would have meaning to you. Nowhere would the thought of the potential loss of a job enter in. It would seem to you that you had forgotten it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可能在很快的一连串画面里看到地上的一个深洞。它可以被显然很穷而且来自另一世界的一个街头顽童代替。一具棺材也许会出现，或一个黑皮夹飞过空中。你可能看到一个酷寒、晦暗的冬天景色。久已忘怀的一本旧书中的一个人物可能出现又消失。在这些画面之间可能有一堆相反的象征，代表你的希望——一朵春花、一满桌食物、一套新衣，任何对你意味着“丰盛”的征兆。可能失掉工作的念头根本没有出现过，好像你已忘了它。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:57.) Through the use of symbols, however, your feelings would be given full play, each image rising and falling in flow with feelings so far underneath consciousness ---- pools of emotion ---- that you were not aware of them. They would automatically bring about these images however. Now with reflection you could connect these with their origin, but usually they would pass you by.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:57)可是，透过象征的应用，你的情感得到了充分的发挥，每个影像随着隐藏在意识之下，以致你毫不知觉的那些情感——情感之池——起落。无论如何，它们会自动引来这些影像。你由内省可以把这些影像与其来源连接起来，但它们常常会被你忽视，不为你所觉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If you let yourself lie still longer with eyes closed, the symbolism would continue to change character, losing perhaps some of its visual characteristics and growing more intense in other directions. You might think you smell a particular odor, for example, that is distasteful to you (following through with the situation as given). You might, instead, translate the fear into a frightening physical sensation, and suddenly feel that you are falling, or that something unpleasant touched you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你让自己更久的合眼躺着，那象征会继续改变它的特性，也许失掉它的一些视觉特征而在其他方向加强。例如，你可能以为你闻到一个特别的、你不喜欢的气味(再跟着我们假设的情况)。相反的，你可能把恐惧转译为一种恐怖的身体上的感觉，而突然觉得你在跌落，或什么讨厌的东西触及你。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Any of these changing characteristics of symbols should alert you to the altered state of your consciousness. If you let yourself drift off into sleep here, you would most probably manufacture two or three dreams that symbolized the fear, dreams in which you consider and try out possible solutions within the dream context. The job situation might never appear as such within any of the dreams, of course.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>任何这类特性不断在改变的象征，应使你警觉到你的意识状态已改变了。如果在此处你让你自己渐渐进入睡眠，你极可能会制造两三个象征这种恐惧的梦，而你也在梦的范围内考虑与尝试可能的解决办法。当然，“可能失业”这件事，可能永不会以它的本来面目出现在这任一个梦里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Still, to the unconscious the problem has been set and given. In the following deep protected areas of sleep, the higher centers of the inner self are allowed to function and come to the aid of the three-dimensionally oriented portion of the personality. This more liberated self sees the situation much more clearly, suggests a given line of action (but does not order it), and informs the dreaming self. The dreaming self then manufactures a group of dreams in which the solution is stated within a symbolic dream situation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过对你的无意识来说，这个问题已成立并交给了它，在随后深深被保护的睡眠区域里，“内我”那些更高的中心被许可发挥作用，而来协助人格三次元取向的那个部分。这个较解放的自己把情况看得清楚得多，建议某种行动方向(但并不下命令去做)，而通知做梦的自己。做梦的自己于是制造出一群梦，在其中以一象征性的梦中情况来说明这解决之道。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:11.) The final and more specific interpretation is done in areas of dreaming closer to the waking self, when the symbols grow more and more specific. There is a much more narrow aspect to symbolism, therefore: The closer you get to waking consciousness, the more limited and narrow the symbol. The handier it is in a given physical circumstance, the less valuable it is as a waking lifetime characteristic symbol.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:11)最后而更明确的诠释是在梦快醒的时候做的，那时象征变得越来越明确了。因此象征作用有其远较狭窄的一面：你越接近清醒的意识，象征就变得越有限而狭窄。在某一特定的物质环境里，“象征”若越是唾手可得，在作为一个醒时生活一辈子都具有特性的象征上，它就越没有价值。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>To some extent the more precise a symbol is, the less meaning it can contain. In the most important dream work, done in the deep protected sleep periods, the symbols are powerful enough and yet condensed enough so that they can be broken down, used in a series of seemingly unrelated dreams as connectives, retain their original strength and still appear in different guises, becoming in each succeeding dream layer more and more specific.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>到某个程度，一个象征越精确，它所能包含的意义就越少。在被保护的深睡时期做成的最重要梦里，象征是够强却又够浓缩的，所以它们能被分解，用在一连串表面不相干的梦里作为“连接物”，保持它们最初的力量而仍旧以不同的扮相出现，在接下去的每一个“梦的层面”里变得越来越明确。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now even as you go about your day, your consciousness fluctuates, and you can catch yourself “symbolizing” in these different ways if you get in the habit of observing but not interpreting the state of your mind. Each physical event that has happened to you is filed away within your psyche as a definite group of symbols. These do not represent the experience, they contain the experience. These represent your personal symbol bank as far as your present life is concerned.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>就当你在忙着过日子时，你的意识也在波动，如果你养成观察你的心智状态却不加诠释的习惯。你可捉住自己以这些不同的方式“制造象征”。你所遭遇的每一实质事件，都在你的心灵内被分门别类地储存起来，变成一组明确的象征。这些“象征”并不代表这经验，它们包含了这经验。以你目前的一生来说，这些代表你个人的“象征银行”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:20.) There is a great unity between your daytime symbols and your dreaming ones. In a miraculous shorthand, many symbols carry the burden of far more than one experience, of course, and one symbol will therefore evoke not only one given experience, but similar ones. Personal association, therefore, is highly involved with your personal bank of symbols, and it operates in the dream states precisely as in waking life ---- but with greater freedom, and drawing from the future, in your terms, as well as from the past.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:20停顿。)在你白天的象征与你作梦的象征之间有很大的统一性。当然，许多象征以一种神奇的“速记”方式负荷着远比一个经验更多的经验，因此一个象征会唤起不止一个特定经验，也还包括了那些类似的经验。因此，你个人的象征银行便牵涉到极多的个人联想，而这个银行在梦境的运作与在醒时一模一样——但具有更大的自由。且以你们的话来说，不但向过去的事中“提款”，也向将来“提款”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Therefore, you have greater use of symbolism in the dream state, for you are aware of past and future symbols. These vary in intensity; often they cluster together. Such multidimensional symbols will appear then in many ways, not simply visually. They will affect not only your own physical reality, but all realities in which you are involved. In a manner of speaking the symbols that you know are but the tail end of greater symbols.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，在梦境，你用到更多“象征”，因为你觉察过去与将来的象征。这些象征的强度不同；通常它们群集在一起。那么这种多次元的象征会以许多方式出现，而非仅是可见的影像。它们不仅会影响到你自己的物质实相，而且也影响到所有你所涉及的实相。以某种方式来说，你所知的象征只不过是更大的象征之末端而已。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:28. Jane’s trance had been deep. She was extremely relaxed. She happened to mention that while in trance she often didn’t know whether her eyes were open or closed. I told her that almost always she looked directly at whoever Seth might be addressing, and that she used a range of physical movements and voice effects that could vary considerably. Resume at 10:43.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:28。珍的出神状态一直很深。她极端的放松。她偶尔提起，在出神状态时她常不知自己的眼睛是睁是闭。我告诉她，她几乎总是直视着赛斯说话的对象，并且她在某个范围内，身体动作和声音效果变化相当大。在10:43继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Resume dictation. When I referred to your personal bank of symbols, I meant to specify that this bank was yours from the day of your birth and before. It contained the symbols of your past existences in your terms (and in your terms, you add to it in this life). This bank of symbols must be activated, however. For example, you have visual images when you are born, internal visual images, symbols that are activated the moment you open your eyes for the first time. These serve you as learning mechanisms. You keep trying to utilize your eyes properly until exterior images conform with the inner patterns. This is extremely important, and not understood by your scientists.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：继续口述。当我谈到你个人的“象征银行”时，我是想指明这个银行是你的，自你出生之后甚至出生之前。对你来说，它包含着你“过去世”的象征(又对你来说，你今生再把象征加存进去)。可是，这个“象征银行”必须被催动。例如，在你出生时你有视觉上的影像，那是内在的视觉影像，在你第一回睁眼的那一刹那被你催动的“象征”。这些是你的学习机制。你一再尝试正确地运用你的眼睛，一直到外在影像与内在模式一致为止。这是极重要的，而还没被你们的科学家所了解的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The eye-opening activates the inner mechanism. If there is something wrong physically with the eyes, if they are blind for example, then that particular mechanism is not activated at that time. The personality may have chosen to be born blind for his own reasons. If those reasons change, or if inner psychic developments occur, (pause) then the physical eyes will be healed and the inner mechanism activated. There are endless varieties of behavior along these lines. The inner banks of symbols, however, operate as a drawing account, latent unless you take advantage of them. You think before you learn language, as I mentioned earlier in this book, but you already have at your psychic fingertips past experiences from other lifetimes to guide you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“睁眼”这动作催动了内在的机制。如果眼睛本身有点毛病，好比说，如果它们是瞎的，那么，那特定的机制那时就没被启动。这人为他自己的理由也许选择了要生而眼盲。如果那些理由改变了，或如果发生了内在的心灵发展(停顿)，那么肉眼会被治愈而内在的机构也被启动。像这一类的变化多得不胜枚举。可是，内在的象征银行，就像是个提款户头一样，除非你去“提款”，否则它不会发生作用。如我在这书里早先提到过的，你在学会语文之前先会思想，但你在你“心灵的”指端，已有过去生生世世的经验来指导你。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:49.) Those who are born into the same nationality, say twice consecutively, learn to speak much quicker the second time around. Some infants will think in the language of a past life before the new language is learned. All of this has to do with the use of symbols.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:49停顿。)那些好比说连续两次生于同一国的人，第二回学说话要快得多。有些婴儿在学会新的语文之前，会用前一生的语文来思想。所有这些都与象征的应用有关。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Sound is itself a symbol. You understand that from a given point of silence, sound begins and grows louder. What you do not understand is that from that given point of silence, which is your point of non-perception, sounds also begin that grow deeper and deeper into silence, yet still have meaning and as much variety as the sounds that you know, and these are also symbols. The thought unspoken has a “sound” that you do not hear, but that is very audible at another level of reality and perception.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“声音”本身就是个象征。你了解到，由某一“静默点”，声音开始而越来越响。你所不了解的是，由那同一个“静默点”——那是你的“非感知点”——声音也开始而越来越深入于“静默”，却仍然有意义，且具有与你所知的声音同样多的变化，而这些也都是“象征”。没说出的思想有个你听不见的“声音”，但在实相与感知的另一层面，它却听起来非常清晰真切。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:00.) Trees as they stand are a sound that, again, you do not perceive. In your dreams and particularly beyond those dreams that you recall, are areas of consciousness in which these sounds are automatically perceived and translated into visual images. They operate as a sort of shorthand. Given certain sounds, you could recreate your universe as you know it unconsciously, and any one multidimensional symbol can contain all the reality that you know. End of dictation. (Pause.) Now a few remarks.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:00)再说，站在那儿的树木也是一个你感知不到的声音。在你梦中，尤其是超越过能追忆的梦，有些意识的区域，这些声音在那儿自动被感知，而转译为视觉影像。它们的作用就像是一种“速记”。如果给你某些声音，你就能重创你的宇宙如你无意识地知道的一样，而任一多次元的象征，都能包含你所知的所有实相。口述结束。(停顿。)现在我要说几句话。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(There followed a page or so of personal data. End at 11:06 P.M.)</a>
