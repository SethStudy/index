<div style="display:inline">(因为我分心在绘画上，所以今晚的课弄迟了；我工作到相当晚，需要一个短短的休息。珍感觉很好。她的步调相当快——我相信是自赛斯开始他的书后最快的一种速度。珍的态度轻松，声音平常，眼睛常常闭起来。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(The session began late this evening because of my own distr actions with painting; I worked late, and needed a short rest. Jane felt well. Her pace was quite rapid ---- as fast as it’s been, I believe, since Seth started his book. Jane’s manner was easy and relaxed, her voice average, her eyes closed often.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：我们将有一节短课，开始口述下一章。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: We will have a short session, and begin to dictate the next chapter.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">有了到此为止所给的一点点背景，我们至少可以开始讨论此书的主题：灵魂的永久效力(the eternal validity of the soul)。。即使当我们在探索其他的题目时，我们仍会试着阐明这内我的多次元面向。有许多错误的概念与之相连，首先我们要设法铲除这些。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>With the little background given so far, we can at least begin to discuss the subject of this book: The eternal validity of the soul. Even when we are exploring other issues, we will be trying to illustrate the multidimensional aspect of this inner self. There are many misconceptions connected with it, and first of all we shall try to dismiss these.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">首先，灵魂不是你所拥有的什么东西。它就是你之为你。我通常较喜用“存有”(entity)这字眼，而不用灵魂，只因“存有”这字没有与那些特定的错误概念连在一起，而它的涵义比较不带有组织意义上(organizational sense)的宗教性。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>First of all, a soul is not something that you have. It is what you are. I usually use the term “entity” in preference to the term “soul,” simply because those particular misconceptions are not so connected with the word “entity,” and its connotations are less religious in an organizational sense.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">问题在于你们常把灵魂或存有想成一个已完成的、静态的“东西”，属于你却不是你。灵魂或存有——换言之，你最亲密有力的内在本体——是而且必是永远在变的。因此，它并不像个被珍视的传家宝。它是活生生的、有反应的、好奇的。它形成了你所知的肉身与世界，而它是在一种“变为”的状态。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The trouble is that you frequently consider the soul or entity as a finished, static “thing” that belongs to you but is not you. The soul or entity ---- in other words, your most intimate powerful inner identity ---- is and must be forever changing. It is not, therefore, something like a cherished heirloom. It is alive, responsive, curious. It forms the flesh and the world that you know, and it is in a state of becoming.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在，在这个你的自我所专注的三次元实相里，“变为”预设了某种到达，或一个目的地——给那曾在变为状态中的东西一个结束。但灵魂或存有基本上存在于其他的次元，而在这些次元，“完成”(fulfillment)并不依赖到达不论是心灵上或别的方面的任何一点。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now, in the three-dimensional reality in which your ego has its main focus, becoming presupposes arrival, or a destination ---- an ending to that which has been in a state of becoming. But the soul or entity has its existence basically in other dimensions, and in these, fulfillment is not dependent upon arrivals at any points, spiritual or otherwise.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">灵魂或存有总是在一种流变不居或学习的状况，而且在与时间或空间无关却与主观感受有关的发展中。这并不像听起来的那样神秘。我的每个读者都在玩一种游戏，有意识的自我假装不知那全我确实知道的事。既然自我确实是全我的一部分，那么它必然基本上知道这些事。但是，在它对物质实相的极端贯注中，它假装不知道，直到自我觉得有能力实质地利用这些资料为止。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The soul or entity is always in a state of flux, or learning, and of developments that have to do with subjective experience rather than with time or space. This is not nearly as mysterious as it might sound. Each of my readers plays a game in which the egotistical conscious self pretends not to know what the whole self definitely does know. Since the ego is definitely a part of the whole self, then it must necessarily be basically aware of such knowledge. In its intense focus in physical reality, however, it pretends not to know, until it feels able to utilize the information in physical terms.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此，你确实可以与内我相通，你并没与你的灵魂或存有断绝关系。自我喜欢把自己想作是掌舵的船长，可以这样说，因为自我本来就在动荡不安的物质实相大海中打前锋，它专心在这个任务上，不愿分神。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You do have access to the inner self, therefore. You are hardly cut off from your own soul or entity. The ego prefers to consider itself the captain at the helm, so to speak, since it is the ego who most directly deals with the sometimes tumultuous seas of physical reality, and it does not want to be distracted from this task.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">总是存在着心理或心灵上的通道在自身的不同层面之间往复发送咨询，自我无异议地接受由人格内在部分来的资料。事实上它的地位大半依赖这种对内在资料的无异议接受。换句话说，自我即你以为是自己的，“外在的”自己——你的那个部分，它之所以能维持它的安全与表面上的统率权，正是因为你人格的内在层面不断地支持它。内我维持肉体的运作，并且与由外在和内在状况而来的多种刺激保持沟通。灵魂与存有经过转世、经过存在及在可能的实相(probable realities)中的经验，不但没有萎缩，反而得以扩展——以后我会再解释“可能的实相”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Channels, psychological and psychic, always exist, sending communications back and forth through the various levels of the self, and the ego accepts necessary information and data from inner portions of the personality without question. Its position in fact depends in a large manner upon this unquestioning acceptance of inner data. The ego, in other words, the “exterior” self that you think of as your self ---- that portion of you maintains its safety and its seeming command precisely because inner layers of your own personality constantly uphold it, keep the physical body operating, and maintain communications with the multitudinous stimuli that come both from outside conditions and inside conditions. The soul or entity is not diminished but expanded through reincarnations, through existence and experience in probable realities ---- something that I will explain later.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:19。注意从十点起给了多少资料。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:19. Note the amount of material given since 10:00.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">只因你对自己的存有具有极为狭窄的观念，所以你才坚持它有个几乎是贫瘠的单一性。在你体内有亿万的细胞，但你却称你的身体为一个单位，还认为它是你自己的。你的确是由内而外地造成了它，但你是由活生生的东西形成它的，而每个最小的粒子都有它自己活生生的意识。有丛生的物质，同样的，也有丛生的意识，每一个个体都有自己的命运、能力与潜能。你自己的存有是没有极限的：所以，你的存有或灵魂怎能有界限呢？因为界限会包围它而否定它的自由。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It is only because you have a highly limited conception of your own entity that you insist upon its being almost sterile in its singularity. There are millions of cells within your body, but you call your body a unit, and consider it your own. You do form it, from the inside out, and yet you form it from living substance, and each smallest particle has its own living consciousness. There are clumps of matter, and in that respect there are clumps of consciousness, each individual, with their own destiny and abilities and potentials. There are no limitations to your own entity: therefore, how can your entity or soul have boundaries, for boundaries would enclose it and deny it freedom.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可以休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:24。珍以同样的快速度在10:33继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:24. Jane resumed at the same fast pace at 10:33.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：灵魂常常好像被认为是块宝石，最后被当作礼物呈献给上帝，或像是以前有些妇女看她们的贞操一样——极被珍视却必须失去的东西；失去它是表示给了接受者一样美好的礼物。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Often it seems that the soul is thought of as a precious stone, to be finally presented as a gift to God, or considered as some women used to consider their virginity ---- something highly prized that must be lost; the losing of it being signified as a fine gift to the receiver.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在许多哲学里仍保留了这类的概念——灵魂被还给一个最初的赐予者，或被溶解于存在和非存在之间的某种模糊状态。但是，灵魂最重要的是有创造力。可以由许多观点来讨论它。我对它的特性能有某程度的描写，而的确大部分的读者能自己找到这些特性，如果他们有非常强的动机，如果这是他们最关切的。灵魂或存有本身在任何宇宙中都是最有冲劲、最有精力、最有潜力的意识单位。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In many philosophies this sort of idea is retained ---- the soul being returned to a primal giver, or being dissolved in a nebulous state somewhere between being and nonbeing. The soul is, however, first of all creative. It can be discussed from many viewpoints. Its characteristics can be given to some degree, and indeed most of my readers could find out these characteristics for themselves if they were highly enough motivated, and if this was their main concern. The soul or entity is itself the most highly motivated, most highly energized, and most potent consciousness-unit known in any universe.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">它是浓缩到一个你不可信的程度的能量。它含有无穷的潜力，但它必须努力达成自己的身份，形成自己的世界，它内心背负着所有生灵的重担。在它之内有超过你能理解的人格潜能。要记住，我说的是你的灵魂或存有，也是一般的灵魂或存有。你只是自己灵魂的一种示现而已。你们中有多少人愿意局限你的实相，你整个的实相，在你现有的经验之内？但当你想象你现在的自己是你全部的人格时，或坚持你的本体在无穷的永恒中一直维持不变时，你就是在自我设限。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It is energy concentrated to a degree quite unbelievable to you. It contains potentials unlimited, but it must work out its own identity and form its own worlds. It carries within it the burden of all being. Within it are personality potentials beyond your comprehension. Remember, this is your own soul or entity I am speaking of, as well as soul or entity in general. You are one manifestation of your own soul. How many of you would want to limit your reality, your entire reality, to the experience you now know? You do this when you imagine that your present self is your entire personality, or insist that your identity be maintained unchanged through an endless eternity.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:43)这样一个永恒的确会是了无生气的。在许多方面，灵魂是一个初期的神(incipient god)，以后在本书中我们会讨论“神的观念”。但是，就目前而言，我们只关切到存有或灵魂，那个更大的我，即使现在也在每个读者经验中的隐密处对你悄悄耳语。我希望在这本书里,不只给你保证你的灵魂或存有的永久效力，而且帮助你在自己心里感觉到它充满活力的实相。不过，你首先必须对自己的心理和心灵结构有些概念。当你对你是谁、你是什么有了某程度的了解之后，我才能把我是谁、我是什么解释得更清楚。我希望使你对自己那些深具创造性的方面有所认识，从而能用它们来扩展、扩张你整个的经验。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:43.) Such an eternity would be dead indeed. In many ways the soul is an incipient god, and later in this book we will discuss the “god concept.” For now, however, we will simply be concerned with the entity or soul, the larger self that whispers even now in the hidden recesses of each reader’s experience. I hope in this book not only to assure you of the eternal validity of your soul or entity, but to help you sense its vital reality within yourself. First of all, however, you must have some idea of your own psychological and psychic structure. When you understand to some extent who and what you are, then I can explain more clearly who and what I am. I hope to acquaint you with those deeply creative aspects of your own being, so that you can use these to extend and expand your entire experience.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(略带幽默地：)那是口述的结束。现在请等我一会儿。(停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Somewhat humorously): That is the end of dictation. Now give me a moment. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我想开始这一章，因为一旦开始了鲁柏总觉得好过些。它结束了“下一章将是什么？”的悬疑(微笑著)。不过给我一分钟吧。(停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I wanted to begin this chapter. It always makes Ruburt feel better. It ends the suspense (smiling) as to what the next chapter will be. But give me a moment here. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：在你的人像画里要记着游戏的感觉与轻松的手法。不然你便失去了你的闪亮颜色而陷入你并不想要的晦暗。记着灵魂就在你所见的皮相之下——而当你画一个坐在椅子上的身体，纵使形体上它是不动的，其实它也是经常在一个几乎是神奇的活动状态。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Remember in your portrait the sense of play, and a light hand. Otherwise you lose your sparkling colors and end up with a murkiness that you do not intend. Remember that the soul is plain behind the facade that you see ---- that even the body is in a constant state of almost magical activity, even though as you paint it in its chair, it is physically motionless.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(此地，出乎意料的，赛斯说到上个月我在画的一幅大的人像，今天它让我费了很大的劲。这幅画画的是我父亲所住医院里的一个病人。对象沉默而相当僵硬地坐在他的轮椅里。一切进行顺利，直到在画他衣服的颜色时我遭到困难。最后，我觉得如此气恼，结果竟重新来过。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Here, unexpectedly, Seth referred to a large portrait I’ve been working on for the last month and the one that gave me so much trouble today. The painting is of a patient in the hospital where my father stays. The subject sits mute and quite rigid in his wheelchair. Everything went well until I ran into difficulties with the color of his clothing. I found this so irritating, finally, that I ended up doing the whole thing over.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(一如往常，赛斯对绘画的观察十分精彩；我以前已提过许多次。我也从未听过珍以赛斯的方式讨论绘画。这两个人由相差极远的角度来看这个题目。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(As usual, Seth’s observations about painting are excellent; I’ve said this many times before. Nor have I ever heard Jane discuss painting in Seth’s manner. The two personalities approach the subject from widely divergent viewpoints.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在那明显的静止状态之内，你想要那种极度加速而冷静的活动感觉，那无法被实质地表达——它必须由画中放射出来，而不管你的人像之明显而虚幻的表象。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You want the feeling, within that apparent state of motionlessness, of highly accelerated contained activity that cannot be physically expressed ---- that must radiate from the painting despite the obvious and illusion ary appearance of your figure.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">也许你太过强调椅子，把它当作把你的人物多少包住不动的束缚因素。如你所知，他当然也创造了椅子，因而，也创造了限制。我相信在右下角你有一些困难，(的确不错！)也许是需要更多透明光——但不要加得太明显。你正慢慢解决这些问题。你有问题吗？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You are stressing perhaps too strongly the aspects of the chair, as the binding elements that hold your figure more or less stationary. He, of course also creates the chair, as you know, and therefore the limitations. I believe there is some difficulty, or was (there was!) with the lower right-hand corner, a matter perhaps of needing more transparent lights ---- not too obviously applied however. You are working these matter out. Do you have questions?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“我想没有。我眼睛太累了没办法思想。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“I guess not. I’m too bleary to think.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那我就结束此节。我最衷心的祝福并祝晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I will then close our session. My heartiest regards and a fond good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“谢谢你，赛斯。资料很好。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Thank you, Seth. It’s been very good.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">谢谢你在疲倦时还作笔录。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Thank you for taking dictation when you were weary.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“哦，我还没累到那样。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Well, I wasn’t that badly off.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:58。珍的速度从头到尾都很好。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:58 P.M. Jane’s pace had been good right up until the end of the session.)</details><br>
