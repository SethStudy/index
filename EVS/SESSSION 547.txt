<a id=1 href=1>第546节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>AUGUST 19, 1970, 9:20 P.M. WEDNESDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1970年8月9日 星期三 晚上9：20</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth has suspended dictation on his book for the last five weeks. Two weeks of this went for our vacation, but otherwise we’ve been very busy. Of the four regular sessions held in the remaining time, large portions dealt with matter growing out of the September 4th publication of Jane’s own book, The Seth Material, and a projected radio and television tour.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯在过去五周暂停了写书的事。其中两周是因为我们在度假，但其他时候我们都非常忙。在其余的时间里所举行的四课，大部分是关于9月4号珍自己的书——《灵界的讯息》——出版所引起的事，以及一个计划中的电台与电视的促销旅行。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Now that we could relax a little, however, we had every confidence that Seth would easily resume work on Chapter Eleven of his book, even though Jane hasn’t looked at it for quite a while now. Such was the case.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(现在我们总算能稍微轻松一点了，我们极有信心赛斯会轻松地继续写第十一章，虽然珍有好一会儿没看它了。果然如此。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will resume dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：我们将继续口述。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The time of choosing is dependent upon the condition and circumstances of the individual following transition from physical life. Some take longer than others to understand the true situation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>什么时候进入选择时间要看一个人从肉身生活过渡之后的情形与环境。有些人比其他人需要多花些时间来了解真正的情况。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Others must be divested of many impeding ideas and symbols, as explained earlier. The time of choosing may happen almost immediately, in your terms, or it may be put off for a much longer period while training is carried on. The main impediments standing in the way of the time of choosing are, of course, the faulty ideas harbored by any given individual.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如先前解释过的，其他人则必须丢弃许多阻碍性的概念与象征。选择时间可以几乎立即发生，以你们的话来说，或者它可以被延后一段相当长的时间，而在同时进行训练。自然，延缓选择时间的主要阻碍是一个人心里怀抱的错误概念。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>A belief in heaven or hell, under certain conditions, can be equally disadvantageous. Some will refuse to accept the idea of further work, development, and challenge, believing instead that conventional heaven situations are the only possibility. For some time they may indeed inhabit such an environment, until they learn through their own experience that existence demands development, and that such a heaven would be sterile, boring, and indeed “deadly.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在某些情况下，对天堂或地狱的信念可能同样的不利。有些人会拒绝接受更进一步的工作、发展与挑战的概念，而相信传统的天堂情况是唯一的可能。他们可能的确有一段时间住在这样一个环境，直到他们由自己的经验学到“存在必然要求发展”，而那样的一个天堂将会是枯燥无味、无聊透顶，真的是“死气沉沉”的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Then they are ready for the time of choosing. Others may insist that because of their transgressions they will be cast into hell, and because of the force of such belief , they may for some time actually encounter such conditions. In either case, however, there are always teachers available. They try to get through these false beliefs.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那时他们就准备好进入选择时间了。其他人可能坚持为了他们的罪过，他们将被掷下地狱，而因为这种信念的力量，他们可能有段时间真的遭到这种情形。可是，不论在哪一种情形下，总有老师临场指导，他们试着破解这些错误的信念。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In the Hades conditions, the individuals come somewhat more quickly to their senses. Their own fears trigger within themselves the answering release. Their need, in other words, more quickly opens up the inner doorways of knowledge. Their state does not usually last as long, therefore, as the heaven state.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在“地狱”的人常较快恢复神智。他们自己的恐惧在内心激发了答案的释放。换言之，他们需要较快打开知识的内在门户。因此，他们的情况通常不像天堂的情况拖得那么久。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Either state, however, puts off the time of choosing and the next existence. There is one point I would like to mention here: In all cases, the individual creates his experience. I say this again at the risk of repeating myself because this is a basic fact of all consciousness and existence. There are no special “places” or situations or conditions set apart after physical death in which any given personality must have experience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，两样情况都延后了选择时间和下一次的存在。在此我想说明一点：在所有的情形下，每个人都创造了他的经验。我不厌其烦的一再这么说，因为这是所有的意识与存在的基本事实。在肉身死后，任何一个人并没有他必得经验的一个设定的特别“地方”或情形或情况。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Suicides, as a class, for example, do not have any particular “punishment” meted out to them, nor is their condition any worse a priori. They are treated as individuals. Any problems that were not faced in this life will, however, be faced in another one. This applies not only to suicides, however.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好比拿自杀者作为一类来说，并没有任何特定的“惩罚”为他们而设，他们的情形也不见得特别糟。他们被当作“个人”看待。可是，任何一个在此生没被面对的问题，就得在另一生面对，不过，这并不是只对自杀者适用。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>A suicide may bring about his own death because he rejects existence on any but highly specific terms chosen by himself. If this is the case, then of course he will have to learn differently. Many others, however, choose to deny experience while within the physical system, committing suicide quite as effectively while still physically alive.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>自杀者结束自己的生命，也许是因为除了按照自己选择的非常特定条件外，他拒绝生存下去。如果是这种情形，那么他自然需要重新学习。可是，许多别的人当在物质系统里时，选择了拒绝经验，他们肉体虽然仍活着，也和自杀了没有两样。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:38.) The conditions connected with an act of suicide are also important, and the inner reality and realization of the individual. I mention this here because many philosophies teach that suicides are met by a sort of special, almost vindictive fate, and such is not the case. However, if a person kills himself, believing that the act will annihilate his consciousness forever, then this false idea may severely impede his progress, for it will be further intensified by guilt.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:38)与一件自杀行为相关的种种条件也是重要的，还有个人的内在实相与体悟。我在此提到这点，因为许多哲学主张，自杀的人会遇到一种特别的、几乎是报复性的命运，事实并非如此。可是，如果一个人杀了他自己、相信这个行为将永远消灭他的意识，那么这错误的想法可能会严重阻碍他的进展，因为罪恶感会使他的处境更为恶化。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Again, teachers are available to explain the true situation. Various therapies are used. For example, the personality may be led back to the events prior to the decision. Then the personality is allowed to change the decision. An amnesia effect is induced, so that the suicide itself is forgotten. Only later is the individual informed of the act, when he is better able to face it and understand it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>再次的，还是有老师来解释真正的情况，并且应用各种的治疗法。例如，这个人可能被带回到他作决定前发生的事，然后给他一个改变决定的机会，引起一个“遗忘”的效果，使得自杀事件本身被忘了。直到后来当那个人较能面对和了解自杀这个行为时，才告诉他，他曾自杀过。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Obviously, however, these conditions are also impediments to the time of choosing. It goes without saying that an obsession with earthly concerns also acts in the same manner. In such instances, often the personality will insist upon focusing his perceptive abilities and energies toward physical existence. This is a psychic refusal to accept the fact of death. The individual knows quite well that he is dead in your terms, but he refuses to complete the psychic separation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，这些情况也显然地阻碍了选择时间。不必说对俗世的过分执迷也有同样效果。在这种例子，这个人常会坚持把他的感知能力与精力的焦点对准人世。这是一种心灵上的拒绝接受死亡。这人明明知道他在你们来说是已死了，但他拒绝完成心灵的分离。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: There are instances of course where the individuals concerned do not realize the fact of death. It is not a matter of refusing to accept it, but a lack of perception. In this state such an individual will also be obsessed with earthly concerns, and wander perhaps bewildered throughout his own home or surroundings. The time of choosing will, of course, necessarily be postponed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>自然也有些例子是当事人没领悟到死亡的事实。他不是拒绝接受，却是没能感知到死亡。在这种情形，这样的一个人也会过分执迷于人世，也许在他自己的家或周围困惑地徘徊着。自然，选择的时间也必然延后了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The mechanics of transition therefore are highly variable, as the mechanics of physical life are highly variable. Many of the impediments that I have mentioned impede progress not only after death, but during your own physical existence. This should certainly be taken into consideration. An overly strong identification with the sexual characteristics can also hold back progress. If an individual considers identity strongly in terms of male or female identity, then such a person may refuse to accept the fact of the sexual changes that occur in reincarnational existences. This kind of sexual identification, however, also impedes personality development during physical life.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，过渡的方式是极为变化无常的，就如肉体生活的机制也是变化无常的。我所提及的许多阻碍不止在死后阻碍了进步，而且在你自己尚在人世时也一样。这点无疑应该加以考虑。对性别特征的过强认同也能挡住进展。如果一个人想到本体身份时过度强调他男性或女性的身份，那么这样的一个人可能拒绝接受在转世存在中会发生性别改变这个事实。可是，这种对性别的认同也在人世生活中阻碍了人格的发展。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break and we will continue.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一下，我们再继续。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:53. Jane’s trance had been good, her pace rather fast, her voice quiet. She wasn’t as active or strong as she had been last night, though, when she held a session for her ESP class. Resume at 10:11.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:53。珍的出神状态很好，她的步调相当快，声音轻。但她不像昨晚当她为ESP班上课时那样活跃有力。在10:11继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: While, generally speaking, the issues just mentioned operate as impediments, there are always exceptions. A belief in heaven that is not an obsessional belief can be used as a useful framework, as a basis of operation in which an individual will often accept easily then, the new explanations that will be offered.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>一般而言，虽然刚才所提到的问题会成为阻碍，但总是有例外的。对天堂的信念如果不是一个执迷的信念，就可以被用为一个有用的架构，作为一个运作的基础，于是乎一个人就往往容易接受所给他的新解释。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Even a belief in a time of judgment is a useful framework in many instances, for while there is no punishment meted out in your terms, the individual is then prepared for some kind of spiritual examination and evaluation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在许多例子里，甚至对审判日的信念也是个有用的架构，因为虽则并没有人会对你们“赏善罚恶”，但这个人因而有了作某种灵性上的省察与评估的心理准备。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Those who understand thoroughly that reality is self-created will have least difficulty. Those who have learned to understand and operate in the mechanics of the dream state will have great advantage. A belief in demons is highly disadvantageous after death, as it is during physical existence. A systematized theology of opposites is also detrimental. If you believe, for example, that all good must be balanced by evil, then you bind yourself into a system of reality that is highly limiting, and that contains within it the seeds of great torment.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那些透澈了解“境由心造”的人，困难最少。那些已学会了解梦境并在其中运作的人将最有利。对恶魔的信念在死后是极为不利的，就如在生时也一样。一种系统化善恶对立的神学理论也是很不利的。例如，如果你相信所有的善必须被恶来平衡，那么你就把自己束缚在一个非常狭窄的实相系统里，而在其内含藏着极大痛苦折磨的种子。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In such a system, even good becomes suspect, because an equal evil is seen to follow it. The god-versus-devil, angels-versus-demons ---- the gulf between animals and angels ---- all of these distortions are impediments. In your system of reality now you set up great contrasts and opposing factors. These operate as root assumptions within your reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这样一个系统里，甚至连“善”也变为可疑了，因为一个对等的“恶”必会随之而至。神佛对魔王，天使对恶魔——在动物与天使之间的鸿沟——所有这些扭曲都是阻碍。在你现在的实相系统里，你设立很大的对比与敌对的因素。这些在你的实相中被当作基本假设来运作。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>They are extremely superficial and largely the result of misused intellectual abilities. The intellect alone cannot understand what the intuitions most certainly know. In trying to make sense in its terms of physical existence, the intellect has set up these opposing factors. The intellect says, “If there is good, there must be evil,” for it wants things explained in neat parcels. If there is an up, there must be a down. There must be balance. The inner self, however, realizes that in much larger terms, evil is simply ignorance, that “up” and “down” are neat terms applied to space which knows no such directions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>它们是极端的表面化，大半是误用智能的结果。光凭智能无法理解直觉最确切知道的东西。智能为了试图使人世生活对它而言有意义，乃设立了这些敌对因素。智能说：“如果有善，必有恶。”因为它要干净利落地解释事情。如果有上升，必然有下降。一定要有平衡。可是，内我领悟到由大得多的观点来说，恶只是无知，“上升”与“下降”只是利落的术语，被应用到不知有此种方向的空间上。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:25.) A strong belief in such opposing forces is highly detrimental, however, for it prevents an understanding of the facts ---- the facts of inner unity and of oneness, of interconnections and of cooperation. A belief , therefore, an obsessional belief in such opposing factors, is perhaps the most detrimental element, not only after death but during any existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:25)可是，对这种敌对力量的强烈信念是极不利的，因为它阻止了人去了解这些事实——内在的统一与合一、互相的关联与合作等事实。因此，一个对这种敌对因素的执迷信念也许是最有害的元素，不但在死后也在任何的生存期间。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are some individuals who have never experienced during physical life that sense of harmony and oneness in which such opposing factors merge. Such individuals have many stages to go through following transition, and usually many other physical lives “ahead” of them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些人在人世生活期间从未体验过这种敌对因素汇合时的和谐与合一感。这种人在过渡期后还有许多阶段得度过，而通常还有许多次其他的人世生活在他们“前面”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As you form your physical existence individually and collectively, so after the time of choosing, you join others who have decided upon the same general kind of experience. A strong cooperative venture is then begun as preparations are made. These will vary according to the type of existence chosen. There are general patterns, therefore. No individual’s reality is identical with another’s, and yet there are overall groupings.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>即因你们个人地并集体地形成你们的人间生活，因此在选择时间之后，你们加入那些决定有大致同类经验的人。当准备作好之后，一个很密切的合作性冒险于焉开始。这些将随所选择的存在类型而变化。没有一个人的实相是与另一个人完全相同的，却有大体上的分组。(译注：像极了戏剧演出之种种前置作业。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:34. At first I thought the break was announced because our cat, Willy, had jumped up into Jane’s lap while she was speaking. She flinched so I thought he interrupted her, but upon coming out of trance Jane said she hardly remembered the incident. Her pace had again been fast. Resume in the same manner at 10:44.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:34。最先我以为他宣告休息，是因为我们的猫威立在珍说话时跳到她怀里。她畏缩了一下，所以我以为它打断了她，但在回过神后，珍说她几乎不记得那事。她的步调又是蛮快的。在10:44以同样的方式继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Quite simply, a belief in the good without a belief in the evil, may seem highly unrealistic to you. This belief , however, is the best kind of insurance that you can have, both during physical life and afterward.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>简单一句话：你们可能认为，相信有“善”而没连带相信有“恶”，似乎是非常不切实际的。可是，这个信念是你能有的最好保障，在人世生活期间与其后都一样。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It may outrage your intellect, and the evidence of your physical senses may shout that it is untrue, yet a belief in good without a belief in evil is actually highly realistic, since in physical life it will keep your body healthier, keep you psychologically free of many fears andmental difficulties, and bring you a feeling of ease and spontaneity in which the development of your abilities can be better fulfilled. After death it will release you from the belief in demons and hell, and enforced punishment. You will be better prepared to understand the nature of reality as it is. I understand that the concept does indeed offend your intellect, and that your senses seem to deny it. Yet you should already realize that your senses tell you many things, which are not true; and I tell you that your physical senses perceive a reality that is a result of your beliefs.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>它可能触犯你的理性，你由肉体感官得来的证据也可能大叫说那不是真的。但一个相信善而不信有恶的信念事实上是极实际的，既然在现实生活中它会保持身体更健康，保持你心理上免于许多恐惧和精神难题的干扰，带给你自在和自发的感觉，而你能力的发展在那种心境下也较易完成。在死后它可以把你由恶魔、地狱及强制性惩罚的信念中解脱出来。你将更有心理准备去了解实相的本质如其本然的样子。我了解这观念的确冒犯了你的理性，你的感受似乎也否认它。但你却应已领悟，你的感官告诉了你许多不实的事；而我告诉你，你的肉体感官感知的实相是你信念的结果。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Believing in evils, you will of course perceive them. Your world has not tried the experiment as yet which would release you. Christianity was but a distortion of this main truth ---- that is, organized Christianity as you know it. I am not simply speaking here of the original precepts. They were hardly given a chance, and we will discuss some of this later in the book.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>相信邪恶，你当然会感知邪恶。你们的世界还没有试过那能使你们解脱的实验。基督教只不过是这主要真理的一个扭曲——我是指如你们所知有组织的基督教。我在此不只是讲那些最初的戒律，它们几乎从没被给过一个机会，在此书后面我们将再讨论其中的一些。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The experiment that would transform your world would operate upon the basic idea that you create your own reality according to the nature of your beliefs, and that all existence was blessed, and that evil did not exist in it. If these ideas were followed individually and collectively, then the evidence of your physical senses would find no contradiction. They would perceive the world and existence as good.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那个会使你们的世界改观的实验，是运作于一个基本观念上：你们按照你们信念的本质创造自己的实相，而且所有的存在都是有福的，恶并不存在于其中。如果你们个人与集体地都遵循这些观念，那么你们肉体感官所得到的证据不会有什么矛盾。它们将感知这个世界与存在为“善”的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This is the experiment that has not been tried, and these are the truths that you must learn after physical death. Some, after death, understanding these truths, choose to return to physical existence and explain them. Through the centuries this has been the way. In the system of Probabilities that originates within physical reality, this is also the case.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这是尚未尝试过的实验，而这些是你在死后必须学习的真理。有些人在死后了解了这些真理，选择回到人间来加以阐明。世代以来都是如此。在由物质实相内所缘起的可能系统里，也是这样的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are systems of probability not connected with your own system at all, much more advanced than any you presently imagine, and in these, the truths of which I have been speaking are well known. In them individuals creatively and purposely create realities, knowing how to do so and giving full rein to the creative abilities of consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些可能系统与你们自己的系统完全没有关联，比任何你现在所想象的还要进步得多，在这些系统里，我已讲过的真理是众所周知的。在这些系统里，个人创造性地、有目的地创造实相，他们知道该怎么做，并且让意识的创造能力完全发挥。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:59.) I mention this here simply to point out that there are many other after-death conditions not connected with your system. When you have learned to your capacity in this in-between period, you are ready to progress. The in-between period itself, however, has many dimensions of activity and divisions of experience. As you can see, to put it as simply as possible, everyone does not “know” everyone else.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:59)我在此谈到这点只是为了要指出，有许多其他与你们系统不相连的死后情况。当你在过渡期间尽你所能地学习了这些之后，你就准备好再前进了。不过，这过渡期本身有许多的活动次元和各种分别的经历。尽可能简单地说，可以看得出，每一个人并不“认识”其他每一个人。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Instead of countries or physical divisions, you have psychological states. To an individual in one, another might seem quite foreign. In many communications with those in these transitional states, messages through mediums can appear as highly contradictory. The experience of the “dead” is not the same. The conditions and situations vary. An individual explaining his reality can only explain what he knows. Again, such material often offends the intellect that demands simple, neat answers and descriptions that tally.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>世界上有各种国家或天然的分界，你们呢，则有各种心理的状态。对一个在某状态里的人，另一个状态看起来十分的陌生。与这些在过渡状态的人们的许多通讯中，透过灵媒而来的讯息显得极为矛盾。“死者”的经验并不相同：情形与情况有所不同。一个在解释他的实相的人，只能解释他所知的东西。再次的，这种资料常常冒犯了理性，理性要求简单、利落的答案与相符的描写。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Most individuals from these stages who communicate with “living” relatives, have not reached the time of choosing as yet, and have not completed their training.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>大多数从这些阶段与“活着的”亲人通讯的死者，尚未达到选择时间，还没完成他们的训练。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:06.) They may still be perceiving reality in terms of their old beliefs. Almost all communications come from this level, particularly when there is a bond of relationship in an immediately previous life. Even at this level, however, such messages serve a purpose. The communicators can inform living relatives that existence continues and they can do it in terms that the living can understand.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:06)他们也许还依他们的旧信念来感知实相。几乎所有的通讯都是来自这个层面，尤其是当他们与活人在最近的前生中有亲属关系存在时。可是，即使在这个层面，这种讯息仍有其作用。通讯起码能告诉活着的亲人存在仍在继续，而他们能用活人能了解的方式做到这个。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>They can relate to the living, since often their beliefs are still the same; in fortunate circumstances they can communicate their knowledge as they learn. Gradually, however, their own interests change. They take up relationships in their new existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他们能与活人发生关联，因为他们的信念仍然是一样的；在幸运的情况，他们能一边学一边把他们的知识传过来。但是，渐渐地，他们自己的兴趣变了。他们在新的存在中建立了关系。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>At the time of choosing, therefore, the personality is already preparing itself to leave for another existence. In your terms of time this in-between period can last for centuries. It can last only a few years. Again, however, there are exceptions. There are cases in which a personality goes very quickly into another physical life, in perhaps a matter of hours. This is usually unfortunate, and is caused by an obsessive desire to return to physical life.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，到了选择时间，人格已经准备好到另一个存在去了。以你们的时间来说，这过渡期可能持续几世纪之久。它也可能只持续几年。可是，这又有例外。有些案例中，一个人格很快地进入另一次的人世生活里，可能只在几小时内。这通常是不幸的，是由想要回到肉身生活的执迷欲望所造成的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Such a quick return, however, can also be taken by a personality who is charged with a great purpose, who disregards or discards an old physical body, and is reborn almost immediately into a new one in order to finish an important and necessary project already begun.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，一个负有伟大使命的人格也可能作这种快速的转生，他不要或丢弃了一个旧的肉体，而几乎立即重生于一个新的，以便完成一个已经开始的重要且必要的计划。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now we will end our session unless you have questions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在我们将结束此节，除非你有问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I guess not.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我想没有。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>A hearty good evening to you both.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>衷心祝你俩晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good night, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You should have been here for last night’s ESP class session. You would have enjoyed it ?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你应该在这儿参加昨晚的ESP课。你会喜欢的——</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I’m going to read it.” I had been typing a session in my studio, while class met in our living room. The session had been recorded by a class member, as usual, and we’ll have a transcript of it in a few days.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我会去读它。”当ESP班在我们客厅上课时，我正在画室打一节的记录。一如平常，班上有个同学录下ESP班的课，在几天内我们就有一个誊本。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>? and you would not have had to take notes. (Pause.) Now I am with you here strongly this evening, and if you give yourself the suggestions, then I will help you out of your body. Tell yourself to remember.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>——而且你也不必作笔记。(停顿。)今晚我非常直接有力地与你们同在一起，如果你给自己“出体”的暗示，那我就能帮助你“出体“。要告诉你自己记住“经过”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Okay. I’d like to project.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的，我很想投射。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Until later, then.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，过后再见。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good night, Seth, and thank you.” 11:18 P.M. Jane’s trance had been quite deep, and it took her longer than usual to come out of it. In the latter part of the session l had been able to easily sense the immediacy of Seth’s presence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。谢谢。”11:18。珍的出神状态一直很深，她花了较长的时间回来。在此节的后部，我能很容易地感觉到赛斯的直接在场。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane told me that “at the tail end of the session,” she had picked up this idea from Seth; I could tape a session, and while it was in progress I would be free to do a series of sketches of her speaking for Seth. From the sketches I could then do an oil of her. Jane was sure the idea came from Seth. She’d never thought of it before; and neither had I, for that matter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍告诉我“在课的尾巴处”，她由赛斯那儿收到这概念：我可以把一节课录音下来，那么在它进行的当中，我就可以自由地作一系列她为赛斯讲话的素描。由那素描然后，我可以给她画一幅油画。珍确信这概念来自赛斯。她以前从没想到过；就此事而言，我也从未想到过。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Upon retiring I attempted the suggestions about projection as mentioned by Seth, but I had nothing to report in the morning. If I wait until I go to bed I’ll usually have difficulty giving myself suggestions; I fall asleep too quickly. Jane approaches the sleep state in a more leisurely manner.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在上床时，我试作赛斯所说的关于投射的暗示，但在早上我无可奉告。如果我一直等到上了床再给自己提示，通常都有困难，因为我太快就睡着了。珍以较悠然的态度接近睡眠状态。)</a>
