<a id=1 href=1>1971年7月28日 星期三 晚上9：17</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will resume dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们继续口述。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The exterior religious dramas are of course imperfect representations of the ever-unfolding interior spiritual realities. The various personages, the gods and prophets within religious history ---- these absorb the mass inner projections thrown out by those inhabiting a given time span.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当然，这外在的宗教剧是不断在开展的内在精神性实相之不完美代表。这些各种不同的人格，在宗教历史里的神明与先知——他们吸收了居住在某一段时间的人们所抛出的集体“内心投射”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Such religious dramas focus, direct, and, hopefully, clarify aspects of inner reality that need to be physically represented. (Long pause, eyes closed.) These do not only appear within your own system. Many are also projected into other systems of reality. Religion per se, however, is always the external facade of inner reality. The primary spiritual existence alone gives meaning to the physical one. In the most real terms, religion should include all of the pursuits of man in his search for the nature of meaning and truth. spirituality cannot be some isolated, specialized activity or characteristic.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这种宗教剧贯注并指挥内在实相中必须以物质来代表的那些面，并且希望能澄清它们。(停顿很久，眼睛闭着。)这些戏不仅出现在你们自己的系统里，也有很多投射到其他的实相系统里去了。不过，宗教之本身永远是内在实相的外在表象。其实只是原始的精神存在才赋予物质存在意义。以最真实的说法而言，宗教应包括人在寻求意义与真理的本质时所有的追求，灵性上的追求不可能只是某些孤立、专门的活动或特性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Exterior religious dramas are important and valuable only to the extent that they faithfully reflect the nature of inner, private spiritual existence. To the extent that a man feels that his religion expresses such inner experience, he will feel it valid. Most religions per se, however, set up as permissible certain groups of experiences while denying others. They limit themselves by applying the principles of the sacredness of life only to your own species, and often to highly limited groups within it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>外在宗教剧的重要性和价值，端赖它忠实地反映内在而私密精神生活本质的程度。只要一个人感觉他的宗教表达了这种内在的经验，他才会觉得它是恰当的。可是，大多数的宗教就其本身而论，把某些类别的经验设定为可容许的，而否定其他的。他们限制了自己，把“生命的神圣性”的原则只应用在自己的族类上，并且常是应用在其中非常有限的集团上。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:30.) At no time will any given church be able to express the inner experience of all individuals. At no time will any church find itself in a position in which it can effectively curtail the inner experience of its members ---- it will only seem to do so. The forbidden experiences will simply be unconsciously expressed, gather strength and vitality, and rise up to form a counter projection which will then form another, newer exterior religious drama.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:30停顿。)从来没有任何一个教会能表达所有“个人”的内心体验。从来没有任何教会发现它自己能有效地削减其成员的内心体验——它只是在表面上看似做到了。被禁止的经验只会被无意识地表达出来，积累力量与活力而上升，形成一个相反的投射，从而形成另一个更新的外在宗教剧。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The dramas themselves do express certain inner realities, and they serve as surface reminders to those who do not trust direct experience with the inner self. They will take the symbols as reality. When they discover that this is not so, they feel betrayed. Christ spoke in terms of the father and son because in your terms, at that time, this was the method used ---- the story he told to explain the relationship between the inner self and the physically-alive individual. No new religion really startles anyone, for the drama has already been played subjectively.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这些戏本身的确表达了某些内在实相，而对那些不信任和内我直接接触的人，它们被用作表面上的提醒者。他们会把象征认作实相。当他们发现不是如此时，他们觉得被出卖了。基督以“父与子”的说法来讲，因为以你们的说法，在那时候，这是所用的方法——祂说这个故事以解释“内我”与这“活在肉身中的个人”之间的关系。没有任何新的宗教真的会惊吓任何人，因为其戏剧已然主观地在人心中演过了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>What I have said, of course, applies as much to Buddha as it does to Christ: Both accepted the inner projections and then tried to physically represent these. They were more, however, than the sum of those projections. This also should be understood. Mohammedanism fell far short. In this case the projections were of violence predominating. Love and kinship were secondary to what indeed amounted to baptism and communion through violence and blood.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当然，我所说的对佛陀与基督一样地适用：他们两个都接受了人们的“内心投射”，而后试着具体地代表这些。可是，他们比那些投射的总和还要多。这点你们也应当了解。回教则远远不及。在这例子里，投射是以暴力为主的。他们的确近乎是经由“暴力与流血”来受洗及与神沟通，相比之下，爱与亲情变成是次要的了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In these continuous exterior religious dramas, the Hebrews played a strange role. Their idea of one god was not new to them. Many ancient religions held the belief of one god above all others. This god above all others was a far more lenient god, however, than the one the Hebrews followed. Many tribes believed, quite rightly, in the inner spirit that pervades each living thing. And they often referred to, say, the god in the tree, or the spirit in the flower. But they also accepted the reality of an overall spirit, of which these lesser spirits were but a part. All worked together harmoniously.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这些持续的外在宗教剧里，希伯来人扮演了一个奇怪的角色。一神概念对他们而言并不是新的。许多古老的宗教相信超越所有其他之上的一神。不过，这个在所有其他之上的神却远比希伯来人所追随的神要温和。许多部落相信——相当正确的——充满在每个生物之中的“内在灵性”。而他们常说到，好比说，在树里的神明，或花中的精灵。但他们也接受一个涵盖整体的“灵”的真实性，这些较次要的精灵只是它的一部分，而全都和谐地一同工作。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The Hebrews conceived of an overseer god, an angry and just and sometimes cruel god; and many sects denied, then, the idea that other living beings beside man possessed inner spirits. The earlier beliefs represented a far better representation of inner reality, in which man, observing nature, let nature speak and reveal its secrets.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>希伯来人构想了一个督导神，一个愤怒、公正而有时残酷的神；于是，许多支派否认除了人之外的其他生物还拥有内在灵性的概念。早先的信仰则为内在实相的一个更好的代表，在其中，人观察自然，让自然说话而透露它的秘密。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:45.) The Hebrew god, however, represented a projection of a far different kind. Man was growing more and more aware of the ego, of a sense of power over nature, and many of the later miracles are presented in such a way that nature is forced to behave differently than in its usual mode. God becomes man’s ally against nature.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:45)然而，希伯来人的神代表了一个极为不同的“内心投射”。人越来越知觉到“自我”，及一种凌驾自然的力量之感，而许多后来的奇迹是以这样一种方式表达，以致“自然”被迫以不同于常态的方式来行动。神变成了人反抗自然的同盟。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The early Hebrew god became a symbol of man’s unleashed ego. God behaved exactly as an enraged child would, had he those powers, sending thunder and lightning and fire against his enemies, destroying them. Man’s emerging ego therefore brought forth emotional and psychological problems and challenges. The sense of separation from nature grew. Nature became a tool to use against others.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>早期希伯来人的神变成了人的“脱了缰的自我”之象征。神的行为跟一个被激怒的孩子完全一样——如果这孩子有那些力量——以雷霆闪电与火来对付他的敌人、毁灭他们。因此人正在露出的“自我”带来了情绪与心理上的难题与挑战，与“自然”的分离感更增长了。“自然”变成了对付别人的工具。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Sometime before the emergence of the Hebrew god these tendencies were apparent. In many ancient, now-forgotten tribal religions, recourse was also made to the gods to turn nature against the enemy. Before this time, however, man felt a part of nature, not separated from it. It was regarded as an extension of his being, as he felt an extension of its reality. One cannot use oneself as a weapon against oneself in those terms. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在希伯来人的神出现之前不久，这些倾向已很明显。在许多古老的、现已被遗忘的部落宗教里，也有向神祇求助，使“自然”与敌人作对的事。不过，在此时之前，人觉得是“自然”的一部分，而非自其分离。“大自然”被认作是他自己的一个延伸(extension)，同时他又感觉自己是大自然的延伸。那样说来，一个人不能把“自己”当作攻击自己的武器。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In those times men spoke and confided to the spirits of birds, trees, and spiders, knowing that in the interior reality beneath, the nature of these communications was known and understood. In those times, death was not feared as it is in your terms, now, for the cycle of consciousness was understood.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在那个时候，人跟鸟、树、蜘蛛的精灵说话谈心，知道在其背后的内在实相里，这些沟通的本质是被知道与了解的。在那个时候，人们不像你们现在这样怕死，因为大家都了解意识的周而复始。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Man desired in one way to step out of himself, out of the framework in which he had his psychological existence, to try new challenges, to step out of a mode of consciousness into another. He wanted to study the process of his own consciousness. In one way this meant a giant separation from the inner spontaneity that had given him both peace and security. On the other hand, it offered a new creativity, in his terms.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在一方面，人渴望走出自己之外，走出心理存在所居的架构之外，去尝试新的挑战，走出一种意识模式而走入另一种。他想要研究自己意识的过程。在一方面来说，这意识指远离那给他宁静与安全的“内在自发性”(inner spontaneity)。另一方面，在他来说这提供给他一种新的创造性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I suggest your break, before I get into that.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在我谈那点之前，我建议你休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:01. Jane’s pace had speeded up considerably after a slow start. I told her the material was excellent. Tonight’s session was being held in our living room, since the house was empty except for us. The air conditioner had been on since before the session, yet Jane felt warm at break. In trance, she said, she hadn’t been bothered by any sort of physical discomfort.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:01。珍的步调在一个缓慢的起步后加快了相当多。我告诉她这资料极精彩。今晚的课是在我们的客厅里举行，既然除了我们之外这房子是空的。在课开始前就开了冷气，但在休息时珍却觉得热，她说，在出神状态里她没感到任何身体上的不适。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(During break I went over a few questions about the relationships between the three members of the Christ entity ---- John the Baptist, Jesus Christ, and Paul. After listening for a bit, Jane asked me not to pursue this subject now; she suggested I ask these questions at the end of the chapter, if Seth hadn’t volunteered the answers before then. Resume at 10:13.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在休息时，我念了一遍有关三位基督存有——施洗约翰、基督与保罗——之间的关系的问题。在听了一会儿之后，珍叫我现在不要追问这件事：她建议我，如果在那之前赛斯没有自动回答它们的话，在本章结束时问这些问题。在10:13继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: At this point, the god inside became the god outside.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>就在这个节骨眼上，内在的神变成了外在的神。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Man tried to form a new realm, attain a different kind of focus and awareness. His consciousness turned a corner outside of itself. To do this he concentrated less and less upon inner reality, and therefore began the process of inner reality only as it was projected outward into the physical world.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>人试着形成一个新的领域，想获致一个不同类的焦点与觉察。他的意识转了个弯，转到它自己外面去了，为了要这样做，他越来越不贯注于内在实相上，而因此开始一个过程，内在实相只被当作它向外投射到物质世界的样子。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Before, the environment was effortlessly created and perceived by man and all other living things, knowing the nature of their inner unity. In order to begin this new venture, it was necessary to pretend that this inner unity did not exist. Otherwise the new kind of consciousness would always run back to its home for security and comfort. So it seemed that all bridges must be cut, while of course it was only a game because the inner reality always remained. The new kind of consciousness simply had to look away from it to maintain initially an independent focus.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>之前，人和所有其他生物明白他们内在的统一性，毫不费力地创出环境再去感知它。为了要开始这新的冒险，必须假装这内在统一性并不存在，否则这种新的意识总是要跑回它的家以求安全与慰藉。因此似乎必得切断所有的桥梁，当然那只是个游戏而已，因为内在实相永远在那儿。这种新的意识非得故意不去看它，才能开始维持一个独立的焦点。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I am speaking here in more or less historic terms for you. You must realize that the process has nothing to do with time as you know it, however. This particular kind of adventure in consciousness (smile) has occurred before, and in your terms will again.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在此，我多少是以“历史的说法”来说给你们听的。不过，你们却必须了悟，这过程与你们所知的时间完全无关。这种特别的意识的探险(微笑)，以前曾发生过，以你们的话来说将会再发生。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Here Seth was making a little joke, for Jane has been doing some writing lately which she has tentatively entitled “Adventures in Consciousness.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(此地赛斯在开个小玩笑，因珍近来写了些东西，她曾尝试地名之为“意识的探险”。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>perception of the exterior universe then changed, however, and it seemed to be alien and apart from the individual who perceived it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>对外在宇宙的感知于是就改变了，在那感知者看来，它好像是陌生而与自己分离的东西。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:24.) God, therefore, became an idea projected outward, independent of the individual, divorced from nature. He became the reflection of man’s emerging ego, with all of its brilliance, savagery, power, and intent for mastery. The adventure was a highly creative one despite the obvious disadvantages, and represented an “evolution” of consciousness that enriched man’s subjective experience, and indeed added to the dimensions of reality itself.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:24)因此，“神”变成一个投射出去的概念，与个人无干，与“大自然”也分了家。祂变成人正在浮现的“自我”之反映，带着它所有的光辉、野蛮、力量与统御的企图。纵然有其明显的不利，这个探险却是极富创造性的，代表意识的一个“进化”，丰富了人的主观经验，而的确增益了实相的幅度本身。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>To be effectively organized, however, inner and outer experience had to appear as separate, disconnected events. Historically the characteristics of God changed as man’s ego changed. These characteristics of the ego, however, were supported by strong inner changes.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，为了要被有效地组织起来，内在与外在经验就必须表现为分开的、不相关联的事件。历史上来说，“神”的特性随着人的“自我”改变而变。不过，“自我”的这些特性是被强烈的内在改变所维持住的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane, as Seth, gestured emphatically and often as she spoke. Her pace had been fast since her break.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍，作为赛斯，说话时常常强调地做手势。自她休息后步调一直很快。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The original propulsion of inner characteristics outward into the formation of the ego could be compared with the birth of innumerable stars ---- an event of immeasurable consequences that originated on a subjective level and within inner reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>内在特性这种最初的向外推进而形成自我，可以比拟为无数星辰的诞生——一件起源于主观层面与内在实相之内的事，而产生了不可测量的后果。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The ego, having its birth from within, therefore, must always boast of its independence while maintaining the nagging certainty of its inner origin.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“自我”由内而生，因此必须一直夸耀其独立性，同时又不得不维持对它内在根源的确信。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:30. Still in trance, Jane took time to sip at a beer and light a cigarette. Then):</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:30停顿。仍在出神状态中，不慌不忙地啜着啤酒并点了支烟。然后：)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We’ll have a good chapter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们会有很棒的一章。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Great.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“太好了。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The ego feared for its position, frightened that it would dissolve back into the inner self from which it came. Yet in its emergence it provided the inner self with a new kind of feedback, a different view not only of itself; but through this, the inner self was able to glimpse possibilities of development of which it had not previously been aware. In your terms, by the time of Christ, the ego was sure enough of its position so that the projected picture of God could begin to change.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“自我”对它的处境感到害怕，恐怕它会溶回到它所来自的“内我”。但它的出现给了“内我”一种新的回馈，“内我”不只可以由一个不同角度看看它自己；而且经由这个新角度，“内我”可以瞥见，它以前所不知的种种发展的可能。以你们的话来说，到基督那时候，“自我”对它的地位已很笃定了，因此投射出的“神”的画面也可以开始改变了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The inner self is in a state of constant growth. The inner portion of each man, therefore, projected this knowledge outward. The need, the psychological and spiritual need of the species, demanded both interior and exterior alterations of great import. Qualities of mercy and understanding that had been buried could now surface. Not only privately but en masse they surged up, adding a new impetus and giving a natural “new” direction ---- beginning to call all portions of the self, as it knew itself, together.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“内我”是在一个不断成长的情况，因此，每个人的内在部分把这知识向外投射。这种需要——人类心理与精神上的需要——要求内在与外在两方面的重大改变。本来被埋没的“慈悲”与“了解”特质现在能露面了。它们不只是私人性的，并且是整体性地涌起，增加了一个新的原动力，并带来了一个自然的“新”方向——开始将它所知的自己所有部分召唤到一起来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:38.) So the concept of God began to change as the ego recognized its reliance upon inner reality, but the drama had to be worked out within the current framework. Mohammedanism was basically so violent precisely because Christianity was basically so gentle. Not that Christianity was not mixed with violence, or that Mohammedanism was devoid of love. But as the psyche went through its developments and battled with itself, denying some feelings and characteristics and stressing others, so the historic religious exterior dramas represented and followed these inner aspirations, struggles, and searches.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:38)因此当“自我”认知它对内在实相的依赖时，人对“神”的观念开始改变，但这场戏必须在目前这架构里解决。回教教义基本上是如此暴烈，就正因为基督教教义基本上是如此温和。并非基督教教义没有混和了暴力，或回教教义完全缺乏爱，而是当心灵在其发展过程中与它自己斗争时，否认某些感觉与特性，而强调了其他的，因而历史上宗教的外在戏剧代表并追随这些内在的渴望、奋斗与追寻。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Slower now): All of this material now given must be considered along with the fact that beneath these developments there are the eternal aspects and creative characteristics of a force that is both undeniable and intimate. All That Is, in other words, represents the reality from which all of us spring. (Pause, one of several.) All That Is, by its nature, transcends all dimensions of activity, consciousness, or reality, while being a part of each.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(现在稍慢：)所有现在给的这些资料必须与以下的事实一同考虑，即在这些发展之下有一种力量，其永恒的面貌与创造的特性是不可否认且又切身的。换言之，“一切万有”代表我们全体从之源出的实相。(停顿。几次中之一。)“一切万有”，按其天性来说就超越了行动、意识或实相的所有次元，同时却又是它们每个的一部分。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:45.) Behind all faces there is one face, yet this does not mean that each man’s face is not his own. The further religious drama of which I have spoken, in your terms still to come, represents another stage in both the internal and external dramas in which the emergent ego becomes aware of much of its heritage. While maintaining its own status, it will be able to have much greater commerce with other portions of the self, and also to offer to the inner self opportunities of awareness that the inner self on its own could not procure.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:45)有一个面孔在所有面孔后面，这并不表示每个人的面孔不是他自己的。我曾经谈到过再进一步的宗教剧，在你们说来还未发生，代表了内在与外在戏剧两方面的另一个阶段，在其中露出的“自我”对它的遗产变得觉察多了。在维持住它自己地位的同时，它将能与自己的其他部分有更多的交往，而且也提供“内我”觉察的机会，那是“内我”靠它自己所无法获致的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The journeys of the gods, therefore, represent the journeys of man’s own consciousness projected outward. All That Is, however, is within each such adventure. Its consciousness, and its reality, is within each man, and within the gods he has created. That last is in small letters, and gods shall always be in small letters. All That Is is capitalized.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，“神明”(gods)的旅程代表人自己向外投射的意识之旅程。可是，“一切万有”是在每一个这种探险里的。祂的意识、祂的实相在每个人之内，也在人所创造的“神明”之内。最后那个辞用小写，而“神明”永远应该用小写的。“一切万有”才是大写的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The gods attain, of course, a psychic reality. I am not saying therefore that they are not real, but I am to some extent defining the nature of their reality. It is to some extent true to say: “Be careful of the gods you choose, for you will reinforce each other.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>自然，“神明”获得了一种心灵的实相。我并不是说因此他们不是真的，我却多少是在为实相的本质下定义。在某种范围内，以下的说法是对的：“小心你们所选择的神明，因为你们将彼此互相加强。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Take a break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:55. The pace had been consistently fast, and my writing hand felt it. As Seth had promised, it was a good chapter. Jane said she could feel him pause briefly at times to make sure that she chose just the right word while delivering the material. She would still be in trance, she said, and even speaking, but Seth would wait. Yet she didn’t remember any of the material at break. Resume at 11:08, with the air conditioner still on.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:55。步调一迳很快，我执笔的手感觉得到。如赛斯允诺的，这是很棒的一章。珍说她能感觉到，他有时暂停一下，以确定她在传达时选择了对的字。她说她那时仍是在出神状态，甚至还在说话，但赛斯会等着。在休息时她却不记得任何资料。在11:08继续，冷气机仍开着。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Such an alliance sets up certain fields of attraction. A man who attaches himself to one of the gods is necessarily attaching himself largely to his own projections. Some, in your terms, are creative, and some destructive, though the latter are seldom recognized as such.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这样一种神明和人的结盟建立了某些“引力场”。一个执着于某个神明的人必然大半是执着于他自己的投射。在你们来说，有些投射是创造性的，有些是破坏性的，虽然后者很少被人认知为如此。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The open concept of All That Is, however, frees you to a great extent from your own projections, and allows a more valid contact with the spirit that is behind the reality that you know.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，“一切万有”的开放观念，却把你由你自己的投射中大大地解放出来，而让你与你所知实相背后的灵性有一个更有效的接触。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In this chapter I would also like to mention several other pertinent points.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这一章我还想提及其他贴切的几点。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Some ancient tales have come down through the centuries that tell of various gods and demons who guard the gates, so to speak, of other levels of reality and stages of consciousness. Astral levels are neatly laid out, numbered, and categorized.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>世代相传下来一些古老故事，说是有各种神明和恶魔守卫着所谓到其他实相层面与意识阶段的门户。灵界被整齐地安置好，标上了数字并加以分类。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are tests to pass before entry. There are rituals to be acted out. Now, all of this is highly distorted. Any attempt to so rigorously and precisely express inner reality is bound to be abortive, highly misleading, and in your terms sometimes dangerous; for you do create your own reality and live it according to your inner beliefs. Therefore, be careful also of those beliefs that you accept.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在进入之前要通过考验，还有应当奉行的仪式。其实，这些全都是极为扭曲的说法。想要如此严密、精确地表达内在实相的任何企图注定是失败的、极度误导的，并且以你们的话来说有时还很危险；因为你们的确创造自己的实相，并按照内在信念活在其中。因此，也要小心你们接受的那些信念。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Let me take this moment to state again that there are no devils or demons, except as you create them out of your belief . As mentioned earlier, good and evil effects are basically illusion s. In your terms all acts, regardless of their seeming nature, are a part of a greater good. I am not saying that a good end justifies what you would consider an evil action. While you still accept the effects of good and evil, then you had better choose the good.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>让我利用这一刻再说一次，并没有魔鬼和恶魔，除了你们由信念创造出来的那些以外。如前面提到过的，善与恶的效果基本上是幻觉。以你们的话来说，所有的行为，不管它们看起来是何种性质，全是更大的善的一部分。我并不是说，一个好的目的能使你认为的一件恶行成为合理。当你仍接受善与恶的效果时，那你最好还是选择善。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:25.) I am saying this as simply as possible. There are profound complications beneath my words, however. Opposites have validity only in your own system of reality. They are a part of your root assumptions, and so you must deal with them as such.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:25)我是在尽可能简单地说明这个。可是我的话语背后有深奥的复杂性。只有在你们自己的实相系统里，“对立性”才有意义。它们是你们基本假设的一部分，因此你们必须把它们当作基本假设来看待。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>They represent, however, deep unities that you do not understand. Your conception of good and evil results in large part from the kind of consciousness you have presently adopted. You do not perceive wholes, but portions. The conscious mind focuses with a quick, limited, but intense light, perceiving from a given field of reality only certain “stimuli.” It then puts these stimuli together, forming the liaison of similarity. Anything that it does not accept as a portion of reality, it does not perceive.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，它们却代表了你们不了解的深奥统一性。你们对善、恶的观念，大半是来自你目前所采用的这种意识。你感知不到全体，只感知“部分”。“意识心”以一迅速、狭隘却强烈的光集中焦点，从一特定的实相界只感知到某些“刺激”。然后它把这些刺激放在一起，连结了所有相似的东西，而任何不被它接受为一部分实相的东西，它都感知不到。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The effect of opposites results, then, from a lack of perception. Since you must operate within the world as you perceive it, then the opposites will appear to be conditions of existence. These elements have been isolated for a certain reason, however. You are being taught, and you are teaching yourselves to handle energy, to become conscious cocreators with All That Is, and one of the “stages of development” or learning processes includes dealing with opposites as realities.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>于是，对立性效果是欠缺感知力的结果。既然你们必须在如你感知的世界里运作，那么对立性将会显得是“存在”的条件。可是，这些因素是为了某些理由而被孤立出来的。你们在被教导的过程中，也正在教自己去处理能量，与“一切万有”一起变成有意识的创造者，而“发展阶段”或学习过程之一，就包括了将种种“对立”都当作实相来处理。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In your terms, the ideas of good and evil help you recognize the sacredness of existence, the responsibility of consciousness. The ideas of opposites also are necessary guide lines for the developing ego. The inner self knows quite well the unity that exists.</a>

<a id=1 href=1>(“You certainly were. Thank you, Seth, and good night.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“你的确是不错。赛斯谢谢你，晚安。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:57 P.M. Seth referred to Jane’s ESP class. A long session had been recorded during the class, as happens quite often. And it can be added that Seth was in great form this evening, too.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:57。赛斯说的是珍的ESP班。如常常会发生的，我们录了一长段赛斯课。可以再补充一句：今晚赛斯也很棒。)</a>
