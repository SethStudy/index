我们再开始听写。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: We will resume our dictation.</details>
你不只是每个聚焦于自己实相的其他独立的“你”之一部分，而且还存在着一种感应(sympathetic)关系。例如，因为这种关系，你的经验不必要受限于肉体的感知机构。你可以汲取属于这些其他独立自己的知识。你可以学着把你的注意力由物质实相挪开，或去学新的感知方法，使你能扩大对实相的观念，并且大大扩展自己的经验。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Not only are you part of other independent selves, each one focused in its own reality, but there is a sympathetic relationship that exists. For example, because of this relationship, your experience need not be limited by the physical perceptive mechanisms. You can draw upon knowledge that belongs to these other independent selves. You can learn to focus your attention away from physical reality, to learn new methods of perception that will enable you to enlarge your concept of reality and greatly expand your own experience.</details>
(9:28。珍的传递渐渐开始加快。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:28. Jane’s delivery gradually began to speed up.)</details>
只因为你相信物质实相是唯一有效的实相，所以你没有想到去寻找其他的实相。“他心通”或“千里眼”这种事，可以暗示你有其他种类的感知存在，但在正常清醒状态或在睡眠时，你也卷入相当确定的经验。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is only because you believe that physical existence is the only valid one, that it does not occur to you to look for other realities. Such things as telepathy and clairvoyance can give you hints of other kinds of perception, but you are also involved in quite definite experiences both while you are normally waking and while you are asleep.</details>
所谓的“意识流”只是思想、意象和印象的一条小溪流，而它是一条深得多的意识河流的一部分，这河代表了你更深远的存在与经验。你花了所有的时间审察这条小溪，因而被它的流动催眠了，被它的动作迷住了。同时这些其他的感知与意识流流过而没被你注意，但它们却的确是你的一部分，它们代表你在其他实相层面也涉入十分有效的面向、事件、行动与情感。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The so-called stream of consciousness is simply that ---- one small stream of thoughts, images, and impressions ---- that is part of a much deeper river of consciousness that represents your own far greater existence and experience. You spend all your time examining this one small stream, so that you become hypnotized by its flow, and entranced by its motion. Simultaneously these other streams of perception and consciousness go by without your notice, yet they are very much a part of you, and they represent quite valid aspects, events, actions, emotions with which you are also involved in other layers of reality.</details>
(9:35)你对这些实相与对你主要注意力现在所聚焦的实相，一样积极地、活泼地关心。因你一贯只关心你的肉身与实质的自己，你就把注意力给了好像跟它打交道的那个意识流。然而那些其他的意识流是与你不知觉的其他“自我形相”(self-forms)相连的。换言之，身体只是“在一个实相里的你是什么”的一个显示，但在这些其他的实相里，你有其他的形相。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:35.) You are as actively and vividly concerned in these realities as you are in the one in which your main attention is now focused. Now, as you are merely concerned with your physical body and physical self as a rule, you give your attention to the stream of consciousness that seems to deal with it. These other streams of consciousness, however, are connected with other self-forms that you do not perceive. The body, in other words, is simply one manifestation of what you are in one reality, but in these other realities you have other forms.</details>
在任何基本方面，“你”并没与这些其他的意识流分离；只是你注意力的焦点把你由它们以及它们所牵涉的事件隔开了。可是，如果你把你的意识流想成是透明的，那么你便能学会看透它，看到它底下那些在其他实相的事物。你也可学会升到你现在的意识流之上，而感知那些比方说跟它平行的东西。重点是，只有当你认为受到局限，或当你没领悟到那个自己根本不是你全部的本体时，你才会被局限为你所知的自己。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>“You” are not divorced from these other streams of consciousness in any basic way; only your focus of attention closes you off from them, and from the events in which they are involved. If you think of your stream of consciousness as transparent, however, then you can learn to look through and beneath it to others that lie in other beds of reality. You can also learn to rise above your present stream of consciousness and perceive others that run, for analogy’s sake, parallel. The point is that you are only limited to the self you know if you think that you are, and if you do not realize that that self is far from your entire identity.</details>
其实你常常不知不觉地调频到这些其他的意识流里去——因为再说一次，它们同是你的本体之流的一部分。因此所有的都是相连的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now often you tune into these other streams of consciousness without realizing that you have done so ---- for again, they are a part of the same river of your identity. All are therefore connected.</details>
任何创造性工作都使你涉入一个合作过程，在其中你会学着浸入这些其他的意识流，而获得的多次元的感知，远较你从所知的那个狭窄、平凡的意识流所得为多。因此之故，伟大的创造力乃是多次元的。它的源头不是来自一个而是来自多个实相，它也染上了那个源头的多元性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Any creative work involves you in a cooperative process in which you learn to dip into these other streams of consciousness, and come up with a perception that has far more dimensions than one arising from the one narrow, usual stream of consciousness that you know. Great creativity is then multidimensional for this reason. Its origin is not from one reality, but from many, and it is tinged with the multiplicity of that origin.</details>
(9:49)伟大的创造总像是比其纯物质次元与实相要来的伟大。与所谓的平凡对比，它看来几乎非人间所有。它使你悠然神往。这种创造力自动地提醒每个人他自己的多次元实相。因此，“了解你自己”这句话比大数人可能假设的意义要深远得多。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:49.) Great creativity always seems greater than its pure physical dimension and reality. By contrast with the so-called usual, it appears almost as an intrusion. It takes the breath away. Such creativity automatically reminds each man of his own multidimensional reality. The words “know thyself,” therefore, mean far more than most people ever suppose.</details>
其实在独处的片刻，你可能觉知这些其他的意识流。例如，有时你也许听到语句，或看到影像，那好像是在你自己思想脉络之外的，你可能依照你的教育、信仰和背景来做种种诠释。在那方面而言，它们可能出自几个不同的来源。可是，在许多时候，你无意中把频率转到了你其他意识流中的一个，暂时打开了一个频道，通到那些实相的其他层面——你的其他部分所居之处。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now in moments of solitude you may become aware of some of these other streams of consciousness. You may at times for example, hear words, or see images that appear out of context with your own thoughts. According to your education, beliefs, and background you may interpret these in any number of ways. For that matter, they may originate from several sources. On many occasions, however, you have inadvertently tuned in on one of your other streams of consciousness, opened momentarily a channel to those other levels of reality in which other portions of you dwell.</details>
这些意识流中，可能有一些会涉及了你所谓的一个“转世的自己”思想，聚焦于你所谓的另一个历史时期中。相反的，有时候，按照你的性向、你心灵的灵敏度(psychic suppleness)、你的好奇心、你的求知欲，你可以“接收到”一个“可能的自己”所涉及的事件。换言之，你可能开始知觉到一个比你现在所知远为伟大的实相，开始利用你还不知道自己拥有的能力，并且确知无疑，你自己的意识与本体，是独立于你主要注意力聚焦在其中的这个世界。如果以上所有我说的不是真的，那么我不会在写这本书，你也不会在读它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Some of these may involve the thoughts of what you would call a reincarnational self, focused in another period of history as you know it. You may instead, “pick up” an event in which a probable self is involved, according to your inclination, your psychic suppleness, your curiosity, your desire for knowledge. In other words, you may become aware of a far greater reality than you now know, use abilities that you do not realize you possess, know beyond all doubt that your own consciousness and identity is independent of the world in which you now focus your primary attention. If all of that were not true, I would not be writing this book and you would not be reading it.</details>
(略带幽默地：)现在你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Gentle humor): Now you may take your break.</details>
(“谢谢。”10:01—10:10。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Thank you.” 10:01 to 10:10.)</details>
不管你是醒着或睡着，你这些其他的存在十分快活地继续下去，但在你清醒时，你通常把它们阻挡在外。在作梦状态你对它们知觉得要更多，不过有一道作梦的最后程序，常常给强烈的心理和心灵经验戴上面具，不幸的是，你通常回想到的就是这梦的最后版本。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: These other existences of yours go on quite merrily whether you are waking or sleeping, but while you are awake ordinarily you block them out. In the dream state you are much more aware of them, although there is a final process of dreaming that often masks intense psychological and psychic experience, and unfortunately what you usually recall is this final dream version.</details>
在这最后的版本里，基本的经验被尽可能地转变成物质化的样子，所以已经变形了。不过，这最后的修饰过程不是由你更深的层面所做的，却是比你所了解的更近乎一个有意识的过程。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In this final version the basic experience is converted as nearly as possible into physical terms. It is therefore distorted. This final touching-up process is not done by deeper layers of the self however, but is much more nearly a conscious process than you realize.</details>
我可以用一个小提示来解释我的意思。如果你不想记得某一个梦，你自己会在十分靠近表意识的层面，把它删掉。甚至你常能抓到自己正在有意地忘掉一个梦。修饰的过程几乎是在这同一层面发生，虽然并不完全一样。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>One small point might explain what I mean here. If you do not want to remember a particular dream, you yourself censor the memory on levels quite close to consciousness. Often you can even catch yourself in the act of purposely dropping the memory of a dream. The touching-up process occurs almost at this same level, though not quite.</details>
基本经验就在这儿被匆忙地、尽可能地用物质世界的衣服打扮起来。这并不是因为你想了解这经验，而是因为你拒绝接受它基本上是非物质的。并非所有的梦都是这类的。有些梦真是发生在与你日常活动相连的心灵或精神领域，在这种情形就不需要经过打扮了。但在睡眠经验的最深处——附带说一句，你们所谓梦的实验室里的科学家还没触及到它——你在与自己本体的其他部分及它们所存在的其他实相沟通。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Here the basic experience is hastily dressed up as much as possible in physical clothes. This is not because you want to understand the experience, but because you refuse to accept it as basically nonphysical. All dreams are not of this nature. Some dreams themselves do take place in psychic ormental areas connected with your daily activities, in which case no dressing-up process is necessary. But in the very deep reaches of sleep experience ---- those, incidentally, not yet touched upon by scientists in so-called dream laboratories ---- you are in communication with other portions of your own identity, and with the other realities in which they exist.</details>
(10:20)在这种状态里，你同时也在努力从事与你所知的兴趣有关或无关的工作。你在学习、研究、游戏；你什么事都做，只除了没有如你以为的在睡觉(微笑)。你极为活跃。(幽默地：)你卷入地下工作，卷入真正直接而实际的生活之中。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:20.) In this state you also pursue works and endeavors that may or may not be connected with your interests as you know of them. You are learning, studying, playing; you are anything but asleep (smile) as you think of the term. You are highly active. (Humorously): You are involved in the underground work, in the real nitty-gritty of existence.</details>
且让我在此强调，你根本不是无意识的。你只是看来如此，因为照例在早上你完全不记得这些。但是，到某个程度，有些人是知觉到这些活动的，并且也有方法可以使你回想起它们。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now let me emphasize here that you are simply not unconscious. It only seems that you are, because as a rule you remember none of this in the morning. To some extent, however, some people are aware of these activities, and there are also methods that will enable you to recall them to some degree.</details>
我不想贬低你有意识状态的重要性；例如，当你读这本书时，你应当算是醒的，但在许多方面当你在醒的时候，你远比在所谓无意识的夜间状态还休息得更多呢。那么在睡眠中你对自己的实相还了解得更多些，并且可以自由运用你在白天忽略或否认的能力。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I do not want to minimize the importance of your state of consciousness; as, for example, you read this book. Presumably you are awake, but in many ways when you are awake, you are resting far more than you are in your so-called unconscious nightly state. Then to a larger extent you realize your own reality, and are free to use abilities that in the daytime you ignore or deny.</details>
(10:26)例如，在一个非常单纯的层面，你的意识常在睡眠状态中离开了身体。你与你认识的其他层面实相中的人们沟通，但远超过这个，你创造性地维护你的肉体形相并使它复苏。你处置每日的经验，把它投射到你所认为的将来，由无限的可能事件中选择你愿将它具体化的那些，而开始把它们带进物质世界精神上与心灵上的过程。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:26.) At a very simple level, for example, your consciousness leaves your body often in the sleep state. You communicate with people in other levels of reality that you have known, but far beyond this, you creatively maintain and revitalize your physical image. You process daily experience, project it into what you think of as the future, choose from an infinity of probable events those you will make physical, and begin themental and psychic processes that will bring them into the world of substance.</details>
同时，你把这些资料提供给你本体的所有其他部分，它们住在完全不同的实相中，而你从它们那儿接到类似的资料。你并未与平常醒时的自身失去联系，你只是不聚焦于其上，把注意力挪开了而已。在白天，你只是把这个过程反过来罢了。在此用一个比喻，如果你由那另一个视角来看每日正常的自己，你知道，你可能发现肉体上清醒的自己与现在睡眠中的自己一样奇怪。但这比喻不成立，只为这睡眠的“你”比你引以为傲的清醒的“你”知识广博得多了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>At the same time, you make this information available to all these other portions of your identity, who dwell in entirely different realities, and you receive from them comparable information. You do not lose contact with your ordinary waking self. You simply do not focus upon it. You turn your attention away. In the daytime you simply reverse the process. If you were looking at your daily normal self from the other viewpoint, you see, using an analogy here, you might find that physically waking self as strange as you now find the sleeping self. The analogy will not hold however, simply because this sleeping self of yours is far more knowledgeable than the waking self of which you are so proud.</details>
(10:35)这看起来好像有区分，并不是武断的或强加于你的。它只不过是被你目前的发展阶段所引起的而已，而且它的确会变化。许多人游历到其他的空间里——可说是游过其他的意识流，而把这当作他们正常清醒生活的一部分。有时奇怪的鱼会由这些水中跃出！<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:35.) The seeming division is not arbitrary, or forced upon you. It is simply caused by your present stage of development, and it does vary. Many people take excursions into other realities ---- swim, so to speak, through other streams of consciousness as a part of their normal waking lives. Sometimes strange fish pop up in those waters!</details>
在你们看来，我显然是这样的一条怪鱼，由其他的空间游上来，观察一个属于你们而非我的存在空间。所以说，在所有这些意识流之间、所有这些心理与心灵经验的象征性河流之间，都有通道存在。由我的空间与由你的空间一样可以作些游历。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now I am obviously such a one in your terms, swimming up through other dimensions of reality and observing a dimension of existence that is yours rather than my own. There are, therefore, channels that exist between all these streams of consciousness, all these symbolic rivers of psychological and psychic experience, and there are journeys that can be made from my dimension as well as yours.</details>
最初鲁柏、约瑟和我是同一存有或整个本体的一部分，因此象征地说，有些心灵之流结合我们。所有这些意识全汇合成一个常常被比为“意识大海”的东西，一个流溢出所有确实性的泉源。理论上，从任何一个意识开始，你都会找到所有其他的意识。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now initially Ruburt and Joseph and I were a part of the same entity, or overall identity, and so symbolically speaking, there are psychic currents that unite us. All of these merge into what has often been compared to as an ocean of consciousness, a well from which all actuality springs. Start with any one consciousness, and theoretically you will find all others.</details>
(在10:43停顿。)且说自我常常充任一个水坝，来挡住其他的感知，不因它有意如此、或因自我的天性使然、或甚至因为这是自我的一个主要功能，却只是因为你以为自我的目的是抑制性而非扩展性的。你真的想象自我是自己很弱的一个部分，它必须与自己的其他强壮得多、又有说服力、也的确更危险的部分对立而保卫它自己；因此你就相当违反它自然倾向地训练它戴眼罩。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pause at 10:43.) Now often the ego acts as a dam, to hold back other perceptions ---- not because it was meant to, or because it is in the nature of an ego to behave in such a fashion, or even because it is a main function of an ego, but simply because you have been taught that the purpose of an ego is restrictive rather than expanding. You actually imagine that the ego is a very weak portion of the self, that it must defend itself against other areas of the self that are far stronger and more persuasive and indeed more dangerous; and so you have trained it to wear blinders, and quite against its natural inclinations.</details>
自我的确想了解与诠释物质实相，并与它发生关系。它想要帮助你在物质存在中生存下去。但由于你给它戴上眼罩，乃妨碍了它的感知与固有的弹性。然后因为它的没有弹性，你又说这是自我的自然功能与特性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The ego does want to understand and interpret physical reality, and to relate to it. It wants to help you survive within physical existence, but by putting blinders upon it, you hamper its perception and native flexibility. Then because it is inflexible you say that this is the natural function and characteristic of the ego.</details>
自我无法与你不许它去感知的一个实相发生关联。当你不许它用它的能力，去发现那些它必须在其中操纵的真实情况时，它仅能助你苟延残喘。你把眼罩给它戴上，而后还说它看不见。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It cannot relate to a reality that you will not allow it to perceive. It can poorly help you to survive when you do not allow it to use its abilities to discover those true conditions in which it must manipulate. You put blinders upon it, and then say that it cannot see.</details>
你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break.</details>
(10:49，珍曾人事不知，她说：“我告诉你我今晚真是出去了……”她的步调很好，偶尔有短的停顿。11:02再开始。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:49. Jane had been well dissociated. “I’ve really been out tonight, I can tell you that….” Her pace had been good, with short pauses occasionally. Resume at 11:02.)</details>
那是听写的结束。现在等我们一会儿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>That was the end of dictation. Now give us a moment.</details>
(照他近来的模式，赛斯以两页其他资料做为结尾。这次资料是有关珍多年写诗和写小说训练其背后的理由。我认为是非常妙的。赛斯解释珍的诗一直是“她想要了解存在和实相本质这个欲望的一个创造性分支，她探索心灵的方法，……进入其他的领域……一个调查的方法和一个探究其结果的方法。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Following his pattern of late, Seth wound up the session with a couple of pages of other material. This time the data concerned the reasons behind Jane’s years of training in writing poetry and fiction. It was very astute, I thought. Seth explained how Jane’s poetry had always been “a creative offshoot of her desire to understand the nature of existence and reality, her way of probing psychically… into other realms[realms]… a method of investigation and a method of exploring the results.”</details>
(赛斯又说她的小说是珍的“探索可能性与试图了解其他人的方法。她所有的[写作]是她创作生活的一部分，但现在她更为直接地调查实相的本质……这人的主要兴趣极为统一,没有东西会被遗漏。创造性的自己正在运作，你知道——完全走向它想去的地方”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Her fiction, Seth added, was Jane’s “way of probing Probabilities and of trying to understand other people. All of her [writing] is a part of her creative life, but now she is investigating the nature of reality far more directly…. There is a great unity in the personality’s main interests. Nothing will be left behind. The creative self is operating, you see ---- going exactly where it wants to go.”</details>
(赛斯说，珍的心灵经验本身引发其他的创造性努力，引领她投入更深的、真的是无限宇宙的创造力之源……<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane’s psychic experiences, Seth said, would themselves initiate other creative endeavors, leading her to delve into deeper, literally unending, universal pools of creativity….</details>
