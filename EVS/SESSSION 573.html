(这课派蒂·密豆顿在场，她昨日由加拿大渥太华开车来艾尔默拉上珍的ESP班。1970年9月，当我们为珍自己的书《灵界的讯息》作宣传旅行时，在宾州费城结识派蒂。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(The session was witnessed by Patty Middleton, who drove down to Elmira from Ottawa, Canada, yesterday to attend Jane’s ESP class. We met Patty in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in September, 1970, while we were on tour for Jane’s own book, The Seth Material.</details>
(今天派蒂详细告诉珍关于她以一简单的、似瑜珈的技巧，所做对“制约训练”的研究。在一个“脑动电流描记器”(electroencephalograph，或称脑波仪)的监督下，她学会了“打开”她的阿尔法脑波，使脑电面(EEG)上显出阿尔法波来。这使得她达成某种放松却觉知的状态，在其中感知与感觉维持着理想的平衡。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Today Patty filled Jane in on her studies in operant conditioning; how, with a simple Yogalike technique, monitored by an electroencephalograph, she learned to “turn on” her alpha brainwaves. This resulted in her achieving a certain state of relaxed awareness, where perceptions and feelings were held in ideal balance.</details>
(这种“阿尔法技巧”被认为有许多医学上的潜能，虽然并不确知这状态是如何产生的。每个从业者都有他自己的解释与对它的“感觉”。赛斯在本节开头给了“阿尔法”一个短评。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(The alpha technique is thought to have many medical potentials, although it isn’t really known how the state is produced. Each practitioner has his or her own explanation and “feeling” for it. Seth comments briefly on alpha at the beginning of the session.</details>
(派蒂热心地告诉我们，赛斯在第十七章的第569与570节中谈到“意识的种种不同阶段”资料，与她近来的研究密切吻合。此外，她的评论与资讯与目前这一章如此配合，使我开始奇怪是否她现在来访并非“纯属巧合”。我们并未与她通信。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Patty enthusiastically told us that Seth’s material on the various stages of consciousness, in the 569th and 570th sessions in Chapter Seventeen, closely agreed with her recent studies. In addition, her comments and information fit in so well with this present chapter that I began to wonder if something more than coincidence had led her to visit us now. We hadn’t been corresponding with her.</details>
(注：派蒂看了赛斯书的最近几章，但珍没有。不过她俩曾讨论过那资料。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(A note: Patty read the late chapters of Seth’s book but Jane did not. The two of them discussed the material, though.)</details>
好。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now.</details>
(对派蒂打趣道：)我不认为你学我的声音学得很像，我的声音可没那么难听吧……我有几点要说。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(To Patty, amused): I did not think that you did a very good job imitating my voice. Now surely I do not sound as badly as all that…. I have a few remarks.</details>
“阿尔法状态”是个门槛，是介于人格肉身取向的部分与内我之间的初步状态。鲁柏常把他自己推过这状态而到达更深的状态，而大致来说对它不甚熟悉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: The alpha state is a threshold, a preliminary state between the physically oriented portions of the personality and the inner self. Ruburt often propels himself through this state to deeper states, and to a large extent is unfamiliar with it.</details>
照他的特性，当他离开身体时他也是这么做，几乎不在阿尔法的门槛处停顿而是由那儿起飞。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Characteristically, when he leaves his body he does the same thing, hardly pausing at the threshold of alpha but taking off from there.</details>
我想先作些口述，虽然后来我可能有些评论，所以请等一会儿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I want to do some dictation, though I may have some comments later, so give us a moment here.</details>
(在9:42停顿。)现在：就肉体而言，“色”、“声”、“香”合起来给你主要的感官资料，而组成你的肉体官能。可是，在别的层面，这些是分开的，因而嗅味有一个视觉上的实相，如你所知，视觉资料也可以用别的感官知觉来感知。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pause at 9:42.) Now: Physically, smell, sight, and sound are combined together to give you your main sense data and compose your physical senses. At other levels, however, these are separated. Odors therefore have a visual reality, and, as you know, visual data can also be perceived in terms of other sense perceptions.</details>
象征可以聚合或分飞，可以分开或统一的被感知。即因每件事对你而言有自己的象征，所以你对它们有你独特的组合方式。这些象征可以用许多方式被转译或感知；例如，像一串音符、像几种感觉的组合、像一连串的意象。在意识的种种不同阶段，你会以不同的方式去感知象征。于是，“整个多次元象征”在那些别的意识状态也有其实相，但在实相的其他层面也都是如此。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The symbols can come together or fly apart, can be perceived separately or as a unity. As each event has its own symbol for you, so you have your characteristic way of combining these. These symbols can be translated and perceived in many terms; as a series of notes for example, as a combination of senses, as a series of images. At various stages of consciousness you will perceive the symbols in different terms. The multidimensional symbol in its entirety, then, has a reality in other states of consciousness, but also at other levels of reality entirely.</details>
(9:45)你们好像以为你们的思想是秘密的一样，虽然到现在你该知道并非如此。例如，不只你的思想透过心电感应的沟通而明显易见，而且有时候在你不知不觉中，它们也形成了你可称为“假象”(pseudo-images)的东西，就在你平常感知的物质范围“之下”或“之上”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:45.) You operate as if your thoughts were secret, though you should know by now that they are not. Not only are your thoughts apparent through telepathic communications, for example, but without your conscious awareness they also form what you may call pseudo-images “beneath” the range of physical matter as you normally perceive it in some cases, or “above” this same range.</details>
因此，就好像你的思想以物体的样子出现在其他实相之内——它们本身是活的，有活力的，在别的系统里长出来，就如花或树在物质系统里好像无中生有地长出来一样。可以说，这些“假象”然后在某些别的系统里被用为“原料”，它们是在你帮忙播种却不感知的实相里既有的“自然现象”，创造的原料。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is, therefore, as if your thoughts appear within other realities as objects ---- alive and vital in themselves, growing into other systems as flowers or trees grow up seemingly from nothing within physical reality. These can then be used as the raw material, so to speak, in certain other systems. They are the given “natural data,” the raw material of creativity in the realities that you help seed but do not perceive.</details>
以这样的方式来说的话，那么，你的思想遵循着法则，它们的行为与活动也遵循法则，虽然你称你的思想是你自己的，但你们并不了解这些法则。于是它们被其他类的意识操纵，如同一直变化不已的自然现象，不与你相干。在这种系统内的固有意识，对这现象的起源并不知道，也不知你自己的实相。它们把它们感官所接受的证据认作实相，就如你们大多数人一样，他们不会想到这现象是源自它们自己的系统之外。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In this manner of speaking, your thoughts then follow laws. Their behavior follows laws, and their activities, that you do not understand, though you call your thoughts your own. They are then manipulated, independently of you, by other kinds of consciousness as ever-changing natural phenomena. The native consciousness within such systems is not aware of the origin of this phenomena, nor of your own reality. They take the evidence that appears to their senses as reality, as most of you do. It would not occur to them that this phenomenon originated outside of their own system.</details>
好比说，如果我对我的读者做了同样的声明，我会被指控为是说：物质实相是宇宙的丢弃物所组成的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>If I were to make the same statement for example to any of my readers, I would be accused of saying that physical reality was composed of the discards of the universe.</details>
我并没有那样说，在刚提到的案例里也没这样暗示。在你们的系统里，你们直接参与物质实相的形成。你们的自然现象，是个人、群众与集体的思想、感觉与情感之具体化。在这方面来说，你的系统比刚才说的那个要较富创造性。在另一方面，在这些其他系统之内，有个强大而革新的“集体意识”正在发展。在其中个人的身份和本体感是保持了，但在个人之间容许有更大的内在活动，有一个大规模“象征池”(symbol-pools)的创造性交流，更方便由其中提取精神与心灵上的象征。即因如此，这些人更清楚地认知，创造性形象与他们对大自然所感知资料之间的关联。他们故意改变与变化对自然所感知的资料，并且拿它来做实验。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am not saying that, nor implying it in the case just mentioned. In your system you have a direct hand in the formation of physical reality. Your natural given data is the result of individual, mass, and collective thoughts, feelings, and emotions, materialized. Your system in this respect is more creative than the systems just mentioned. On the other hand, within these other systems there is a strong innovative group consciousness developing, in which identity is retained but greater inner play allowed between individuals, a large creative interchange of symbol-pools, a drawing uponmental and psychic symbols with greater facility. Because of this, these individuals recognize more clearly the connection between creative images and given sense data. They purposely alter and change their given sense data, and experiment with it.</details>
(在10:00停顿。)所有这些都涉及了以一种最亲密的方式来运用象征。在你人格的某个层面，你知道所有不同的运用象征的方式，不仅在你的系统也在别的系统里。如前面提到过，没有一个实相系统是关闭的。你的思想、形象与感觉，因此改变了在一些其他系统里的自然现象。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pause at 10:00.) All of this involves a working with symbols in a most intimate manner. At certain levels of your personality you are aware of all the different ways in which symbols are used, not only in your system but in others. As mentioned earlier, no system of reality is closed. Your thoughts and images and feelings therefore alter the given sense data in some other systems.</details>
不过，在那些系统里发展出来的革新模式，也可以在你自己的系统内多少被感知。系统与系统之间有经常不断的渗漏。在你种种不同的意识阶段，你经过了可以与许多这些系统相关联的区域。有些你所经过的阶段，对别种意识是天生固有的领域，而在你经过这些时，你会发现自己以属于那个层面特性的方式来运用象征。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The innovative patterns developed in those systems, however, can be to some extent perceived within your own. There are constant bleed-throughs. In your various stages of consciousness you pass through areas that can be correlated with many of these systems. Some stages through which you pass are native stages to other kinds of consciousness, and while passing through these you will find yourself using symbols in the way that is characteristic of that level.</details>
现在你可以让指头休息一下。(对派蒂：)如果你想一个美好的念头，你可以令一朵花在那儿(在客厅里)长出来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take a break and rest your fingers. (To Patty): ---- and if you think a pretty thought, you may make a flower grow up there (in the living room) somewhere.</details>
(10:03。珍的出神状态很好，她的步调很快，声音安静。在休息期间，当我们三人在尝试“阿尔法状态”的时候，珍猛然发现她自己已投射了出去。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:03. Jane’s trance had been good, her pace fast, her voice quiet. During break, while the three of us tried alpha states, Jane abruptly found herself projecting.</details>
(一株雄伟的西科梨树〔sekel pear tree〕，比两层楼还高，本来长在我们公寓西边的那一片地上。我们常由客厅的窗子欣赏它。去年那邻屋的房东，一位专业人士，把树砍掉了，腾出地方来作停车场。珍说她似乎利用阿尔法状态作为投射基地，进入过去而进入该树；她发现自己有那么一会儿在它的一丛叶子里，向外窥视……<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(A magnificent Seckel pear tree, well over two stories tall, used to grow on the property west of our apartment house. We often admired it from our living room windows. Last year the owner of the house next door, a professional man, had the tree cut down to make room for a parking lot. Jane said she seemed to use the alpha state as the base for a projection into the past and into this tree: she found herself, briefly, amid a cluster of its leaves, peering out….</details>
(在10:24继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Resume at 10:24.)</details>
现在：象征在其形式上应该是流动而变化不已的。而有些可能被用作局限原创性经验的窗子，因此成了欺瞒而非照亮、启迪的方法。当这发生时总是涉及了“恐惧”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Symbols should be fluid, ever-changing in their form. Some can be used as casements to house original experiences, as methods of deception therefore rather than illumination. When this happens fear is always involved.</details>
“恐惧”被带进意识的各个阶段充当造成变形的镜头，隐蔽了所有象征之自然的次元(深、广等)，充当对自由流动的一个阻挡与妨碍。具有爆炸性的象征可用为释放的原动力，把那些被关的东西放出来。若没有自然界的暴风雨，你们全会发疯。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Fear taken into the various stages of consciousness acts as a distorting lens, hiding the natural dimensions of all symbols, acting as a barrier and as an impediment to free flow. Symbols of an explosive nature serve as releasing agents, setting loose that which has been encased. Without physical storms you would all go insane.</details>
很少有人了解象征的侵略性本质，也不了解侵略性与创造性之间的关系。这些绝非相反的特性，而若没有一种侵略的冲击，象征将缺乏其高度活动力。它们会存在于一种永久不变的环境。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The aggressive nature of symbols is little understood, nor the relationship between aggression and creativity. These are far from opposing characteristics, and without an aggressive thrust, symbols would lack their high mobility. They would exist in a permanent kind of environment.</details>
就是意识的创造性与侵略性这两面，使它能利用象征，能经过经验的各个层面，而思想的侵略性把它自己推入——虽然为你所不知——你不了解的实相。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is both the creative and aggressive aspects of consciousness that allow it to use symbols, to move through various levels of experience, and the aggressive nature of thought that so propels it, despite your knowledge, into realities that you do not understand.</details>
侵略性与被动性两者都在“生育象征”的背后，因为两者都需要。它们两者也都在“死亡象征”之下，虽然这点没被了解。当侵略性与创造性的比例不适当时，当意识太过偏向此方或彼方，当“象征”对你所居的特定心理环境而言，不是流得太快就是太慢时，便产生了“惯性”(inertia，或称惰性)。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>aggressiveness and passivity are both behind symbols of birth, for both are needed. They are both beneath symbols of death, though this is not understood. Inertia results when aggressiveness and creativity are not in the proper proportions, when consciousness leans too severely in one direction or another, when the flow of symbols is either too quick or too slow for the particular psychological environment in which you dwell.</details>
(10:32)于是就发生了许多停顿。尽可能简单地说，有一个几乎不可思议的一刻，一个“空无”(no-reality)发生了，一个象征被困于动与不动之间，一个“悬而未决”的时候。当然这以许多方式被转译与反映出来。在这种时期，就各方面来看，事实上某些象征可能失去了意义，脱离了个人的经验，只留下“惯性”的空隙。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:32.) Pauses then occur. To put it as simply as possible, there is an almost inconceivable moment in which a no-reality occurs, in which a symbol is caught between motion and no motion, a time of uncertainty. This is of course translated in many ways, and reflected. In such periods, certain symbols can be lost to all intents and purposes, dropping out of an individual’s experience, leaving gaps of inertia.</details>
这种空隙十分真实地存在于许多系统。你在许多层面碰到它们。例如，你可能发现自己在经历一种意识状态，在其中似乎无事发生，没有心理的景致或可认识的象征发生。这些不仅在心理或心灵上存在，而且以空间来说，也存在如“空白的区域”。这空间最后可能会有新的象征填入。如果你感知够敏锐，有时你能捉到自己正遭到这样的实相状态，在其中无物出现，而除了你自己的意识外也没有明显其他意识的踪迹。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>These gaps exist quite literally in many systems. You encounter them on many levels. You may find yourself experiencing a state of consciousness, for example, in which nothing seems to happen, and no psychological landscape or recognizable symbols occur. These exist not only psychologically or psychically, but as blank areas in terms of space. The spaces may be filled finally with new symbols. If you are perceptive enough, you can sometimes catch yourselves encountering such states of reality in which nothing appears and no signs of any consciousness outside of your own is apparent.</details>
这种空白点可以被种下新的象征，而常被用作通道，经过它插入新的创造性概念与发明。因此，这些空隙被别人认出，而被看作黑暗的空间。它们也代表了对那些探索内在实相的心灵旅行者(mind-travelers)的无阻力区域。它们代表不拥挤的区域，但也是开放的通路，自身不活动而被动地等待着。有些象征也是这样被动地等着被催动。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Such blank spots can be seeded with new symbols, and are often used as channels through which new creative ideas and inventions are inserted. These gaps are recognized by others, therefore, and viewed as dark spaces. They also represent areas of no resistance for those mind-travelers who are probing inner realities. They represent uncluttered areas, but also open channels, inactive in themselves but passively waiting. Now some symbols also wait in such a passive manner to be activated.</details>
以你们的话来说，它们代表未来的经验，目前还潜伏着。因此这些“惯性”的空白点到某个程度是具有创造性的，就在于这些其他的象征可能游进它们之内而被看到。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They represent future experience, in your terms, that presently lies latent. These blank spots of inertia, therefore, are creative to some extent, in that these other symbols may swim into view within them.</details>
现在你可以休息一下，我们会再回来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take your break and we will return.</details>
(10:43。大多数时间珍的步调又是一直很快。我写得手快吃不消了。以同样的样子在11:12继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:43. Jane’s pace had been fast again for the most part. My writing hand was beginning to flag. Resume in the same manner at 11:12.)</details>
我们即将结束口述，请等我们一会儿。(停顿。)阿尔法层面是未区分的。如果你要的话，你可用那儿的能量。它是源头或水塘，在那儿能量的库藏存以备用，存在于较内在的自己与外在的自己之间。从人格的较深层面，符号与预兆都进到这个区域里来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: We will end dictation; and give us a moment. (Pause.) The alpha level is undifferentiated. The energy there is available to be used as you want to. It is the fountainhead or pool in which reservoirs of energy are held in reserve, pulled between the more interior self and the outer self. Into this area come signs and portents from deeper levels of the personality.</details>
因为它处于这样的境地，它在操纵人体上又有些特别的用处。当你们正在学的时候，自发性在此是极端重要的。你在进入阿尔法状态之前的意识大半决定你将有那种经验，它自动地把你的注意力集中于那些特殊区域。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Because it is so situated, it is also of particular use in manipulating the physical organism. As you are learning, spontaneity is extremely important here. Your intent before you enter the alpha state largely predetermines the kind of experience you will have, automatically focusing your attention in those specified areas.</details>
心中没有目的地在那些区域涉足一番也是很有益的，因为此处你可能无意中会得到任何必须的资讯。当你学着探索这地带，你可用它作为其他活动的发射台。在这样做时，你把你的肉身托付得很安全。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is also beneficial to dip into those areas with no purpose in mind, for here whatever necessary information that you require without your conscious knowledge can be made available. When you learn to explore this region you can use it as a launching pad for other activities. In so doing you leave your physical body in good hands.</details>
当你的意识离开身体的时候，阿尔法状态为你维护身体的良好状况。当然不论怎样它都会这样做。可是，对前世的答案处于一个更深的层面，如果你想的话，可以从阿尔法状态去“钓钓”看，看能不能钓到它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>When your consciousness leaves your body, the alpha state maintains its good condition for you. It does this of course in any case. The answer to past lives lies in a deeper level, however. You can fish for it from the alpha state if you prefer.</details>
(派蒂：“只是随便地？就像丢一根线到水里那样？或者是否可能给它一些指引？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Patty: “Just randomly? Like throwing a line into the water? Or is it possible to use some direction?”)</details>
你可以给予指引到某个程度，但必须从阿尔法状态中寻求指引，从那些较深的层面里要求它。或者，经过更多的训练，你也许可以亲自进入那些区域。这就更直接了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You can use direction to some extent, but you must seek the direction from the alpha state, requesting it from the deeper layers. Or you may enter those areas yourself, with more training. This is more direct.</details>
(派蒂：“我能否只靠尝试这些不同的状态而发现我自己？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Patty: “Will I discover myself just by trying these various states?”)</details>
(微笑：)你知道你能，否则你不会问我这问题。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Smile): You know that you will, or you would not have asked me the question.</details>
(派蒂：“那个回答很好。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Patty: “That’s a nice answer.”</details>
(接着有两页多的资料给派蒂。之后，因为我的右手真的麻了，我把笔记本放在一边，参加派蒂和赛斯的即兴讨论。赛斯的能量与活力似无穷尽——他的步调甚至加快了。在11:37之后此节结束。我们全都累坏了。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Over two more pages of material for Patty followed. After that, with my right hand practically numb, I put my notebook aside and joined Patty and Seth in an impromptu discussion. Seth’s energy and vitality seemed to be inexhaustible ---- his pace even speeded up. The session ended at 11:37 P.M. All of us were weary.)</details>
