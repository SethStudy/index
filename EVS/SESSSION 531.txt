<a id=1 href=1>1970年5月20日 星期三 晚上9：19分</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will resume dictation, and we are beginning Chapter Eight. (Note: This was apparently a slip of the tongue.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们再开始口述，我们开始第八章。(注：这显然是说溜了嘴。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It seems to you that you have only one form, the physical one that you perceive, and no other. It also seems that your form can only be in one place at one time. You have indeed other forms that you do not perceive, and you also create various kinds of forms for various purposes, although you do not perceive these physically either.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在你看来，你只有一种形相(form)，即你感知到的肉体，并无其他的。同时，看起来好像在同一时间你只能身在一处。你的确有其他你不知觉的形相，而你也为了不同的目的创造各类不同的形相，虽然你也无法实质上知觉它们。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Your main sense of identity is involved with your physical body, so that it is, for example, extremely difficult for you to imagine yourself without it, or outside it, or in any way disconnected from it. Form is the result of concentrated energy, the pattern for it caused by vividly directed emotional or psychic idea images. The intensity is all important. If you have, for example, a highly vivid desire to be somewhere else, then without realizing it consciously a pseudophysical form, identical with your own, may appear in that very spot. The desire will carry the imprint of your personality and image, even though you remain unaware of the image or its appearance in the other location.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你主要的身份感是关乎你的肉体的。因此，举例而言，你极难想象你自己没有它，或在它之外，或在任何方面与它切断。形相是能量集中的结果，它的模式来自有鲜明指向的情感上或心灵上的概念影像(idea images)。强度是最重要的。举例来说，如果你有极为鲜明的欲望想要在某一个地方，那么一个与你完全相同的假物质形相可能就在那儿出现，而你意识上并不知晓。那欲望会带着你的人格与影像的印记，虽然你一直不知觉这影像或它在另一地点的出现。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Though this thought-image usually is not seen by others, it is quite possible that in the future scientific instruments may perceive it. As it is, such an image may be perceived by those who have developed use of the inner senses. Any intensemental act ---- thought or emotion ---- will not only be constructed in some physical or pseudophysical manner, but will also bear to some extent the imprint of the personality who originally conceived it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>虽然这心念影像(thought-image)通常不会被别人看到；在将来很可能科学仪器可以感知它。目前，那些已经会用内在感官的人可能会感知这样的影像。任何强烈的精神活动——思想或情感——不仅会以某种物质或假物质的方式被建构，而且还会带着最初孕生它的人格印记。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30.) There are many such incipient or latent forms. To help you imagine what I am speaking of, you might think of them as ghost image, or shadow images, though this is only for the sake of analogy ---- forms, for example, just beneath, that have not emerged completely into physical reality as you know it, but are nevertheless vivid enough to be constructed. You would think them quite real indeed, if you could see them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30)有许多这类初期的或潜在的形相。为了帮你想象我所说的，你可以把它们想为鬼影，或幻影，好比说——虽然这只是为了比喻——刚刚在物质之下的形相，还没完全露出于你所知的物质实相之中，但却是够鲜明而可被建构的。如果你能看到它们，你会认为它们的确是相当真实的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Each individual actually sends such replica images of himself out frequently, though the degree of the materialization may differ, some forms, for example, being more or less shadowy than others. However, these forms are not mere projections ---- “flat” images. They have a definite effect upon the atmosphere. They “make room” for themselves in ways that are rather difficult to explain, although they may coexist at times with physical objects or shapes, or may even be superimposed upon these. In this case there is a definite interaction ---- an interchange that is, again, beneath physical perception.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>实际上，每个人常常放出自己的这种复制影像，虽然具体化的程度可能有所不同。例如，有的形相比较清晰，有的比较模糊。不过，这些形相却不只是投影——“平面的”影像。它们对空气有确切的影响。很难解释它们为自己“找地方”(make room)的方式，虽然它们有时能与物体或形状共存，甚或重叠于其上。在这种情形一定有种相互作用——一种在肉体知觉之下的交换作用。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may suddenly strongly wish that you were standing by a beloved but distant, familiar seashore, for example. This intense desire would then act something like a core of energy projected outward from your own mind, given a form, your form. The place that you had envisioned would then attract the form, and it would instantaneously stand there. This happens with great frequency.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如，你可能突然非常希望你是站在一处你所爱却遥远的熟悉海滨。这强烈的欲望于是就会像是一个能量的核心，由你自己的心里向外投射出一个你的形相。然后，你所想象的地方就会吸引这形相，而它立即就站在那里。这种事经常发生。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It would not be seen under usual circumstances. On the other hand, if the desire were still more intense, the energy core would be greater, and a portion of your own flow of consciousness would be imparted to the form, so that for a moment you in your room might suddenly smell the salt air, or in some other way perceive the environment in which this pseudoimage stands.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在通常状况下人看不见它。在另一方面来说，如果欲望还要更强烈些，能量核就更大了，而你自己意识之流的一部分便会移转给那形相，因此有一瞬在房内的你可能突然闻到咸空气，或以其他的方式知觉到这假象所处的环境。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:44.) The extent of perception will vary here to a great degree. To begin with, your physical form is the result of great emotional focus. The fantastic energy of your psyche not only created your physical body, but maintains it. It is not one continuous thing, although to you it seems permanent enough while it lasts. It is nevertheless in a constant state of pulsation, and because of the nature of energy and its construction, the body is actually blinking off and on.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:44)此处知觉的程度会有很大的不同。第一，你的肉身是极强的情感焦点的结果，你心灵的奇妙能量不只是创造了你的肉身，而且还维护它。虽然对你来说，在肉身仍存在时，它看来像是够恒久的，不过它却并不是一个有持续性的东西。它依然是在不断的脉动(pulsation)状态，而因为能量的本质与肉体的构造，肉体事实上是一明一暗地闪烁着。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: This is difficult to explain, and for our present purposes it is not entirely necessary that you understand the reasons for this pulsing; but even physically, you are “not here” as often as you are. Your emotional intensity and focus create forms beside your physical body, however their duration and degree are dependent upon the intensity of any given emotional origin.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这很难解释，而为我们眼前的目的，你们并不完全需要了解这脉动的理由；即使就肉体来说，你也“不是”像表面上看来那样常在这儿的。你的情感强度与聚焦创造了你肉体之外的形相，但它们的持久性与程度则是依赖任一情感源头的强度。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Your space is therefore filled with incipient forms, quite vivid, but beneath the regular structure of matter that you perceive.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此你们的空间充满了初期的形相，相当鲜明生动，但却是在你能感知的物质一般结构之下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane, as Seth, reached across the coffee table between us, to take my half-full glass of beer. I note this because of the following):</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍身为赛斯，手伸过在我们之间的咖啡桌，来拿我半满的啤酒杯。我写下这个是因为下面的事：)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Ruburt thanks you. You need not note this down. We slow down now and then to choose the particular word, for some of this material is rather difficult.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>鲁柏谢谢你。你不需写下这句话。我们不时慢下来以便选择那特定的字，因为这资料有些是相当难的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Very interesting.” I had noticed the nearly regular variations in the speed of Jane’s delivery not long after the session began. Each segment of this fast, then slow, tempo seemed to cover a few paragraphs at the most. The effect was much more apparent tonight than usual.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“很有意思。”在开始后不久，我就注意到珍说话的速度有近乎规律性的变化。这先快后慢的节拍每一段似乎最多只包括了几段话。这效应今晚比一般要明显得多。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>These projections, then, actually are sent out constantly. Some more sophisticated scientific instruments than you now have would clearly show not only the existence of these forms, but also vibrations in varying waves of intensity surrounding those physical objects that you do perceive.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，这些投射事实上是经常在发出的。比你们现在更成熟的科学仪器，不但会清晰的显示这些形体的存在，并且也会显出环绕着那些你能见的物体每种不同强度的振动波。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:57.) To make this clearer, look at any table in the room before you. It is physical, solid, and you perceive it easily. Now for an analogy, imagine if you can that behind the table is another just like it, but not quite as physical, and behind that one another, and another behind that ---- each one more difficult to perceive, fading into invisibility. And in front of the table is a table just like it, only a bit less physical appearing than the “real” table ---- it also having a succession of even less physical tables extending outward. And the same for each side of the table.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:57)为了使你们更清楚这点，看着室内你眼前的任何一张桌子，它是实质的、坚固的，你很容易感知它。现在打个比喻，如果你能想象在那桌子后面有另一张跟它一样的，但却没那么实质的桌子，在那后面又有另一张，在另一张后面又有一张——一张比一张更难感知、更模糊，消褪到看不见了。而在那张桌前有一张跟它一样的桌子，只是比“真的”桌子看来没那么实质——它同样也有一串更不实质的桌子延伸出来。桌子的每一边都一样。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now anything that appears in physical terms also exists in other terms that you do not perceive. You only perceive realities when they achieve a certain “pitch,” when they seem to coalesce into matter. But they actually exist, and quite validly at other levels.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>其实每件以实质出现的东西也存在于你所不能感知的方式里。只当实相到某一个“程度”(pitch)，当它们似乎合并成物质时，你才会感知它们。但它们在别的层面确实存在而且有效。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break, and relax at another level.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息，在另一个层面放轻松。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:02 to 10:20.) There are also realities (pause), that are “relatively more valid” than your own; in comparison, strictly for an analogy, for example, your physical table would appear as shadowy in contrast, as [like] those very shadowy tables we imagine. You would have a sort of “supertable” in those terms. Yours is not a system of reality formed by the most intense concentration of energy, therefore. It is simply the one you are tuned into, part and parcel of. You perceive it simply for this reason.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:02—10:20。)也有些比你们自己的实相“较为更有效”的实相(停顿)；完全只为比喻，举例来说，比起来你实质的桌子在对比之下就显得模糊了，就像那些我们想象的很模糊的桌子。那样说来，在那种实相里的桌子是一种“超级桌子”。因此，你们的实相并不是由最强烈集中的能量所形成的实相系统。它只不过是你们对准频率的一个实相，你们是其重要部分的一个实相。你能感知它只为了这个理由。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Other portions of yourself, therefore, of which you are not consciously aware, do inhabit what you could call a supersystem of reality in which consciousness learns to handle and perceive much stronger concentrations of energy, and to construct “forms” of a different nature indeed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，你自己其他为你的意识所不知觉的部分，确是住在一个你可称之为实相的超级系统(supersystem of reality)之中，在那儿意识学着处理与感知远为强烈的浓缩能量，并且学习建构真的是不同性质的“形相”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Your idea of space is then highly distorted, since space to you is simply where nothing is perceived. It is obviously filled with all kinds of phenomena (pause), that make no impression at all upon your perceptive mechanisms. Now in various ways and on occasion, you can tune into these other realities to some degree ---- and you do so spasmodically, though in many cases the experience is lost because it does not register physically.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，你的空间概念是极为扭曲的，既然对你来说，空间只是看不到任何东西的地方。空间很显然是充满了各种的现象(停顿)，在你的感知结构上却完全不留痕迹。且说以种种不同的方式，偶尔你也能在某程度对这些其他的实相调准频率——间歇性地这样做，虽然许多时候这经验失落了，因为它没有在肉体上被记住。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:30.) Think again about this form that you sent to the oceanside. Though it was not equipped with your own physical senses, it was of itself to some extent able to perceive. You projected it unknowingly, but through quite natural laws. The form built up from intense emotional desire. (Pause.) The image then follows its own laws of reality, and to some extent, and to a lesser degree than you, has a consciousness. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:30停顿。)再想想你送到海边的这个形相。虽然它没具备你自己的肉体感官，它自己却在某范围内有感知力。你不知不觉地却是透过十分自然的法则把它投射出去的。这形相由强烈的情感欲望建立起来。(停顿。)这形相然后遵循自己实相的法则，它到某个范围是有意识的，只是比你们的程度要少。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: You are, using an analogy again, sent out by a superself who strongly desired existence in physical form. You are no puppet of this superself. You will follow your own lines of development, and through means far too difficult to explain here, you add to the experience of the superself and also then extend the nature of its reality. You also insure your own development, and you are able to draw upon the abilities of the superself.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>再用一个比喻，你是被一个极度渴欲以肉体形式存在的超我(superself)送出的。你并非这超我的傀儡。你将遵循自己的发展方向，而透过一些根本无法在此解释的方法，你增加了超我的经验，同时，也就扩展了它的实相本质。你同时保证了自己的发展，也能汲取超我的才能。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Nor will you ever be swallowed by the self that in these terms seems so superior. Because you exist, you send out like projections of your own, as mentioned earlier. There is no end to the reality of consciousness, nor the means of its materialization. Nor is there any end to the developments possible for each identity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你也不会被在这情况下看起来好像如此卓越的超我所吞没。因为你存在，你送出自己的相似投射，如我以前所说的。意识的实相是无止境的，它具体化的方法也是无止境的。而每一本体的可能发展也是无止境的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: I wanted to begin this chapter this evening so that we would have a good start. I will give you an easy, short session, however.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我想今晚开始这一章以使我们有个好的开始。然而我会给你一节短而轻松的课。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I’m okay.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我没问题。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You yawned frequently.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你常常打呵欠。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“That hardly matter. I feel pretty good right now.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“那没什么关系。现在我觉得很好。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Take a very brief break then and we shall continue.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那就暂时休息一下再继续。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:43. Jane’s trance had been good. The regular rhythm of the session had continued. Resume at a slower rate at 10:54.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:43。珍的出神状态很好。课的正常节奏仍继续着。在10:53以较慢的速度继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Let me make it clear once again: Your present personality as you think of it is indeed “indelible,” and continues after death to grow and develop.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：让我再一次说清楚：你所知的自己目前的人格的确是“不可磨灭的”，在死后仍继续生长与发展。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I mention this again in the middle of our present discussion so that you do not feel lost, or negated, or insignificant. There are obviously an infinite number of gradations in the types and kinds of forms of which we have been speaking. That energy which is projected from our “superself,” that spark of intense identity that resulted in your physical birth, that unique impetus, in the one way has many similarities to the old concept of the soul ---- except that it contains only a part of the story.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在我们现在的讨论中途，我再提及此点，为的是使你不会感到失落、被否定或不重要。我们所谈形相的形式与种类显然有无限的层次。那由我们的“超我”投射出的能量，那造成你肉身诞生强烈本体的火花，那独特的推动力，在某方面却与灵魂的老观念有许多相似处——只是除了那老观念只包含了一部分的故事。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause at 11:01. Jane was now pausing very noticeably between many phrases as she delivered this material.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在11:01停顿良久。当珍讲这资料时，她很明显地在许多句子间停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>While you continue to exist and develop as an individual, your whole self, or soul, has such vast potential, that it can never be expressed fully through one personality, as somewhat explained in one previous chapter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当你做为一个个人继续的存在与发展时，你的全我或灵魂有如此广大的潜力，它永不能由一个人格完全得到表达，如我在前面一章中略为解释的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, through very intense emotional focus you can create a form, and project it to another person who may then perceive it. This may be done consciously or unconsciously; and that is rather important. This discussion does not concern the so-called astral form, which is something entirely different. The physical body is the materialization of the astral form.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>由非常强烈的情感聚焦，你能创造出一个形相，而把它投射给另一人，他于是可能会知觉到它。这可以是有意识或无意识地做到的；而那是颇重要的。这讨论与所谓的灵体(astral form)无关，那是完全不同的东西。肉体是灵体的具体化。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:05.) It does not desert the body for any length of time, however, and it is not this that is projected in cases like the seaside analogy used earlier. You are presently focused not only in your physical body, but within a particular frequency of events that you interpret as time. Other historical periods exist simultaneously, in forms quite as valid; and other reincarnational selves. Again, you simply are not tuned to those frequencies.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:05)不过，灵体不会长时间的舍弃身体，它也不是像先前所用的海滨比喻里，那个被投射出去的东西。你目前不只是聚焦在你的肉体上，而且也聚焦在一个事件的特定频率里，即你所谓的“时间”。其他的历史时代及转世的自己，都以同样有效的形式同时存在着。再说一次，你只是没有向那些频率对准而已。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You can know what happened in the past and have histories, because according to the rules of the game that you accepted, you believe that the past, but not the future, can be perceived. You could have histories of the future in the present, if the rules of the game were different. Do you follow me?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以知道过去所发生的，而且拥有“历史”，因为按照你接受的游戏规则，你相信过去——但非将来——可以被感知。如果游戏规则是不同的，你可以在现在就有未来的历史。你懂吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我懂。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Long pause at 11:11.) In other levels of reality, the rules of the game change. After death in your terms, you are quite free perceptively. The future appears as clearly as the past. Even this is highly complicated, however, for there is not just one past. You accept as real only certain classifications of events and ignore others. We have mentioned events. There are also probable pasts therefore, that exist quite outside your comprehension. You choose one particular group of these, and latch upon this group of events as the only ones possible, not realizing that you have selected from an infinite variety of past events.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在11:11停顿良久。)在实相的其他层面，游戏规则变了。对你们来说，死后你可以相当自由地感知。未来与过去看来一样的清晰，可是这也是极复杂的，因为过去不只有一个。你只接受某种类别的事件而忽略了其他的。我们谈到过去事件，因此，也有可能的过去事件存在于你的理解之外。你选择这些事件中特定的一组，然后把这组事件锁定，当作唯一的可能，而没领悟到你是由无限种过去事件中选择的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are then, obviously, probable futures and probable presents. I am trying to discuss this in your terms, since basically, you must understand, the words “past,” “present,” and “future” are no more meaningful as far as true experience is concerned than are the words “ego,” “conscious,” or “unconscious.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，显然就有可能的未来和可能的现在了。我在试着以你们的说法来讨论这个问题，因为基本上，你必须了解，如果是讲到真正经验的话，“过去”、“现在”与“未来”这些字眼，并不比“自我”、“有意识”或“无意识”更有意义。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I will end dictation for this evening. In this probable evening (humorously) I select that probable alternative. My fondest wishes to you both.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我将结束今晚的口述。在这可能的晚上(幽默地)，我选了可能的选择之一。给你俩我最钟爱的祝福。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:20. Following this, Seth gave two very interesting pages of material concerning a psychic investigator-writer and his wife; they had witnessed the deleted 529th session for last Monday, May 18. Tonight’s session actually ended, then, at 11:35 P.M.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:25，在这之后，赛斯给了两页非常有趣的资料，有关一位心灵研究作家和他的太太：他们曾亲临被删除的上星期一、5月18日的第529课。那么，今晚的课实际上在11:35结束。)</a>
