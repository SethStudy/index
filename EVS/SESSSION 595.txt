<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 594,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第594节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>SEPTEMBER 13, 1971, 9:40 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年9月13日 星期一 晚上9：40</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Only one session was held last week, and that was a long overdue, promised one for friends.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(上周只举行了一课，而那是个早已过了期的、答应给朋友的一课。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Sue Watkins· witnessed tonight’s session. She intended to leave before session time, but Jane invited her to stay at 8:50. Sue’s unexpected presence is a fine example of how spontaneous events can influence a session in a very creative way ---- as Sue’s notes, quoted later, will show.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(苏·华京斯目击了今晚的课。她本想在课前离去，但在9:50的时候珍邀请她留下。苏意外的出席是个很好的例子，说明了自发性事件如何以一种非常富创造性的方式影响一节课——如后面所引用苏的笔记会显示出来的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(As usual, Jane had no idea of what tonight’s session would include. “Stuff for the Appendix, I hope,” she said. She was in an excellent mood, even a hilarious one. This quality also turned up in the session, in Seth’s funny, over-elaborate requests for me to use just the right punctuation and paragraphing.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(一如往常，珍不知今晚的课会包括些什么。她说：“我希望是给附录的东西。”她的情绪好极了，甚至可说是很高兴的。这种特质也在此节中出现，表现在赛斯要求我用最正确的标点与分段时，他的滑稽的、过分啰嗦的态度。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(We were late getting started because of my own work in the studio. Talking and laughing, Jane and Sue waited for me to join them in the living room with my notebook. Jane’s delivery was quite brisk, with an occasional short pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(因我自己在画室工作的耽搁，我们开始得晚了。珍与苏在客厅里有说有笑，等我带着笔记本加入他们。珍的传述相当轻快，偶尔有一个很短的停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: I bid you good evening, and our friend (Sue). I would have some interesting comments to make regarding the relationships between you, but we must be up and about with our Appendix, and so we will continue that. The other information will come in its own time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，我向你及我们的朋友(苏)道晚安。对你们之间的关系我有些有趣的评论，但我们必须为我们的附录工作，因此我们将继续那件事，其他的资讯在它该来时就来了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Objects are the symbols.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>物体即为象征。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You usually think of them simply as realities. You think of thoughts, images, and dreams sometimes as being symbolic of other things, but the truth is that physical objects are themselves symbols. They are the exterior symbols that stand for inner experience.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你们通常只把它们认作是真的东西，你们有时把思想、意象与梦想成是其他事情的象征，但事实却是，具体的物体本身即为象征。它们是代表内在经验的外在象征。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are, therefore, mass physical symbols upon which you all agree, as well as private, personal symbols.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，有你们全都同意的集体物质象征，也一样有私自的、个人的象征。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The whole nature and structure of physical life as you know it, is a symbolic statement made by groups of entities who choose to work with physical symbolism. So the body is a symbol for what you are, or what you think you are ---- and these may be two different things indeed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如你们所知的，物质生活的整个性质和结构，都是那些选择运用物质性象征的“存有群”所制作的一个象征性声明。因此，“身体”是“你是什么”或“你认为你是什么”——而这可能的确是两件不同的东西——的象征。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth actually made an elaborately humorous request for the dash in the last sentence: Jane, her eyes very dark, leaned far forward over our coffee table and spoke to me in a soft voice.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯实际上为了最后一句的破折号提出一个啰嗦的幽默要求：珍的双眼非常黑，由我们咖啡桌的那一边倾身过来，轻柔地对我说话。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Any physical ailment is symbolic of an inner reality or statement. Your entire life is a statement in physical terms, written upon time as you understand it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>任何身体上的病痛都是一个内在实相或声明的象征。你全部的一生是以身体来作的一个声明，写在你所了解的“时间”上。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>New paragraph. (Very quietly): Once you understand the symbolic nature of physical reality, then you will no longer feel entrapped by it. You have formed the symbols, and therefore you can change them. You must learn, of course, what the various symbols mean in your own life, and how to translate their meaning.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(非常安静地：)一旦你了解了物质实相的象征性本质，那你就不会再觉得是被它“陷”在里面。你曾形成了这些象征，因此你就能改变它们。当然，你必须学会在你自己生命里种种象征的意义，以及如何把它们的意义转译出来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>To do so, you must first of all remind yourself frequently that the physical condition is symbolic ---- not a permanent condition. Then you must look within yourself for the inner actuality represented by the symbol. This same process can be followed regardless of the nature of the problem, or of your challenge.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>要做到这个，你首先必须时常提醒你自己，具体的状况是象征性的——并非一个永恒的状况。然后你必须在自己内心寻找那象征所代表的内心实况，不论问题是什么，或你的挑战的性质如何，都可按照这相同的过程去找。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:50.) Your intimate physical environment is, therefore, a symbolic statement of an inner situation. The inner situation is a fluid one, for you are always in a state of becoming. Left alone, you will automatically translate the freely moving, spontaneous inner events into physical reality, therefore altering your environment and changing the symbols.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:50)因此，你切身的物质环境是一个内在情况的象征性声明。内在情况是不固定的，因为你永远在一个变为的状态。你独自不受干扰时，你会自动把自由移动的、自发的“内在事件”转译为物质实相，因而改变了你的环境，也改变了那些象征。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If however you imagine that the environment or physical condition is the reality, then you can feel trapped by it, and spend your efforts fighting a paper dragon. The environment is always altered from the inside. There is instant feedback between the interior and exterior conditions, but the mobility, the necessity and the method of changing the physical environment will always come from within.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，如果你想象那环境或具体状况即为真实，那么你可能感觉被它所困，而花精力去打一只纸老虎。环境总是由内在来改变的，在内在与外在的情况之间有即刻的回馈，但改变物质环境的机动性、必要性与方法总是由内而来的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>New paragraph. (Again, a very quiet, smiling, and polite request. “I’m way ahead of you this time, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>新的一段。(又是一个非常安静的、带笑的、有礼的要求。我说：“赛斯，这次我比你要早得多了。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Many of the ideas given in this book can be used most advantageously to solve personal problems. If these concepts are understood, then the individual should realize the freedom he has to operate purposefully within the structure of physical life. Many of you are so used to looking outward ---- and accepting the physical world as the criterion for reality ---- that it has not occurred to you to look within. The entire framework of your existence, therefore, is constantly flowing from within outward, and being projected into those physical symbols that you mistake, then, for reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在此书中所给的概念，有许多在解决个人问题上都非常有用。如果这些观念被了解了，那么这个人应当了悟，他在物质生活的结构内具有“有目的地运作”的自由。你们有许多人这么惯于向外看——而接受物质世界为实相的标准——以致你们没想到去向内看。其实，你们存在的整个架构是不断的由内向外流，而被投射成那些物质的象征，然后你又误将这些物质象征当作是真的东西。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(To Sue, who sat beside me on the couch): I am pretty good on details too. New paragraph.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(对苏，她坐在沙发上，我的身边。)我对细节也很在行呢。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth burst out with loud and emphatic humor this time because of the work Jane and I have done in recent weeks as we proofread this book, checking all my notes that are included, and so forth.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯大声而加强语气的幽了一默，因为在近几周来珍和我在校对此书时所做的工作、查核所有包括在内的我的注记等等。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The interior drama, therefore, is always the important one. The “story of your life” is written by you, by each reader of this book. You are the author. There is no reason, therefore, for you to view the drama and feel trapped by it. The power to change your own condition is your own. You have only to exercise it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，内心的戏剧永远是那最重要的戏剧。“你一生的故事”是你所写的，是此书的每一个读者所写的。你们就是那作者。因此，你没有理由看了这戏而觉得被它所困。改变你自己情况的权力属于你自己，你只要去运用它。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>To some other types of consciousness, your physical reality is clearly understood in its symbolic form. Objects, as symbols, help construct the very framework of your existence. They, the objects, can then be manipulated quite freely.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>对某些其他类型的意识而言，你们的物质实相很清楚地以它的象征性形式被了解了。物体，作为象征，帮助构建了你们生存架构的本身。然后你们才能十分自由地操纵那些物件。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Thank you.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“谢谢你。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:00. Jane’s pace had been fairly good. Her eyes had been closed often, however, which is rather unusual.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:00。珍的步调相当的好。不过，她的眼睛常常闭着，那是颇不寻常的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The first thing she wanted to know when she came out of trance was if the session contained new material. I had to tell her I didn’t know; I’d been too busy writing. Nor could I keep all of Seth’s book in mind, even though I was working with the manuscript just now. But then, Jane said, neither could she ---- and she’d just finished reading the whole thing over.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(当她脱离出神状态后的第一件事，就是要知道这节是否包含有新的资料。我必须告诉她我不知道；我太忙着写字了。我也不能把所有赛斯的书记在心里，纵使我刚刚还在处理文稿。但是，珍说，她也不能够——而她才刚看完那整本书。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(A note: Jane was halfway through the final draft of her Introduction to Seth’s book when this session was held.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(注：当此课举行时，珍已完成了一半对赛斯书的序的最后草稿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Sue said the material had a great deal of meaning for her, and that she now realized that it hadn’t been an “accident” that she’d dropped in this evening. She had much more to say here, especially concerning her impressions of Jane, Seth, and the great energy involved in these sessions. It developed that Sue had begun to experience and formulate some impressions both before and during the session.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(苏说这资料对她很有意义，而她现在了解她今晚的不约而至并非一件“意外”。她在此还有更多可说的，特别是关乎她对珍和赛斯的印象，以及在这些课里所涉及的巨大能量。事情发展成：苏开始在课开始前以及课进行中间体验到并且形成了一些印象。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Sue’s comments were so very good that I asked her to write them down. She wrote them during the rest of break, then added to them occasionally through the rest of the session. They are presented here in slightly abridged form:</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(苏的评论是这么的好，所以我请她把它写下来。她就在余下的休息期间写了。然后偶尔在课的其余时间加上一些。它们以稍经删节的形式呈现于此：</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“As I sat here before the session,” Sue wrote, “I got an impression of Seth that I’d never had before. It was as though Jane, Rob, and I were traveling at a certain familiar speed while we were talking, although this has nothing to do with motion. When Seth came ‘around’ just before the session, it seemed that something within Jane began to crank up, to whirl or accelerate faster and faster until a certain incredibly other speed was reached ---- a part of Jane’s consciousness that is called Seth.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(苏写道：“当我在课前坐在这儿的时候，我获得了一个对赛斯前所未有的印象。在我们谈话的时候，就像是珍、罗和我在某种熟悉的速度旅行，虽然这与运动毫不相干。当刚在课前赛斯来到‘附近’时，好似珍内部的什么东西开始发动、旋转或加速，越来越快直到达到某个不可置信的另一个速度——那叫作‘赛斯’的珍之意识的一部分。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“At that point the speed was right and things ‘clicked’ somehow. Jane took off her glasses, as she always does. I could almost hear this action; then the Seth personality began to communicate. The Seth Two experience would be an even greater acceleration of this speed, reached at the point of the pyramid effect Jane describes.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“在那一点，那速度正对，而事情不知怎的就‘成了’。珍拿掉她的眼镜，就如她总那样做的。我几乎能听到这动作：然后那赛斯人格开始讲话。那‘赛斯二’的经验该是这速度的一个甚至更大的加速，在珍所描写的‘金字塔效应’那一点达成。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Even while I told Jane about this during break, I could feel this acceleration begin again, as Jane’s consciousness prepared to continue the communication. It was almost an inside-out process of going into trance, and as I watched Seth a few minutes later it seemed that Jane’s consciousness was rushing past her open eyes, beyond my comprehension of what speed is. I now must wonder how the communication ever gets back down to words.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“甚至就在休息中间当我告诉珍这件事时，我都可以感觉这加速又开始了，当珍的意识准备继续这通讯时。那几乎是个从内到外进入出神状态的过程，而当我几分钟后看着‘赛斯’时，似乎珍的意识由她睁着的眼里冲出，超越了我对速度是什么的理解。我现在不得不觉得奇怪这通讯怎么可能退回成为文字的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I don’t mean to say by this that I think Seth and Jane are the same personality; rather, my feeling is that this acceleration connects portions of the same consciousness that are normally so diverse as to be two separate personalities for all practical purposes. I can recognize the same feeling of acceleration when I’m writing well myself, or even talking enthusiastically; but the feeling of vast, incomprehensible speed behind Seth’s eyes goes way beyond that. I could sense the notion of speeds very clearly, both in Jane and Seth, and I felt partly carried along by them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我这样说并不表示说我认为赛斯与珍是同一个人格；我的感觉是这个加速连接同一意识的两个部分，它们平常是如此的不同，以致实际而言是两个分离的人格。当我自己写作顺畅时，甚至热心地谈话时，我能认出这同样的加速感觉；但在赛斯的眼睛后面那广大、不可理解的速度的感觉要远超过那个。我能同时在珍和赛斯两人内非常清晰地感觉速度这玩艺儿，而我觉得我部分地被它们带着走。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“When Jane came out of trance it was, again, an almost audible experience for me ---- a feeling of slowing down from a high airy whine to our normal ‘sound’ or speed. There was a great sense of change. It was as though part of this acceleration was connected with a dimension where sound was more than a hearing thing. It’s a terrific, vital feeling. I could feel it starting up toward the end of each break.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“当珍由出神状态出来时，再一次的，对我它是个几乎可以听见的经验——从一个高而轻飘的哀嘶慢下来到我们正常的‘声音’或速度的一种感觉。感觉有一种极大的变化。就像是这加速的一部分是与一个次元相接，在那儿声音不止是一个‘听觉上的’东西，而是个极妙的、极重要的感觉。快接近每次休息的结尾时，我能感觉它又开始了。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane resumed at 10:25 at a slower pace.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍在10:25以较慢的步调继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Our friend Sue’s observations came very close to an excellent description of Ruburt’s subjective feelings, as he told you during break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们的朋友苏的观察非常接近鲁柏的主观感觉——如他在休息期间告诉你的——的一个精彩描写。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I refer readers to Ruburt’s Introduction, in which he compares his own creative experiences as a writer to those he feels in our sessions. There are several points he did not understand, and so here I would like to clear them. (With a pause): New paragraph.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我要读者看看鲁柏的，在其中他将身为一个作家的他自己的创造经验，与那些他在我们课里的感觉相比。有几点他还不了解的，因此在这儿，我愿把它们弄清楚。(停顿了一下。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In our own sessions he is not aware, consciously, of the creative work that is being done, precisely because he has gone out of the range that the conscious mind can follow. He has projected a portion of himself into an entirely different kind of subjective reality, a different dimension of activity entirely.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在我们自己的课里，他并没有意识地觉察正在做的创造性工作，正因为他已走出了意识心所能追随的范畴。他已将自己的一部分投射到一个全然不同类的主观实相里，一个全然不同的活动次元里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Referring to his Introduction again, he remarks that he misses the excitement of the chase, encountered in his own creative work. Here, you see, the acceleration is so rapid and intense that he is not consciously able to follow it. The unconscious, so-called, has little to do with this phenomenon. It is, however, related strongly to qualities inherent within each consciousness. Such ability is rarely used to full advantage. Connections are made so rapidly that the physical brain is not aware of them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>再谈谈他的，他说他想念在自己的创造性工作中所遇到的那种追逐之乐。你明白吗？在我们的工作中那加速是如此的快而强，他不可能有意识地跟随它。所谓的无意识与这现象并没多大关系。不过，这现象却与在每个意识之内与生俱有的那些特性极有关系。这种能力极少被利用到极致。这些特性这么快地和他连了起来，以致大脑根本没有觉察到它们。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause, one of many, at 10:30.) Ruburt has indeed always possessed this ability to a strong degree. For various reasons, reincarnationally speaking, he allowed himself to remain ignorant of the ways in which the ability could be used for the early portion of his life. During sessions, however, all the characteristics of the inner being are accelerated; the knowing, intuitional, creative abilities, working at a rate far beyond what you would call the norm.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:30停顿，许多中之一。)鲁柏的确一直拥有这能力到一个很强烈的程度。就转世来说，为了各种不同的理由，在他此生的早期部分，他一直不让自己知道利用这能力的那些方式。可是，在上课期间，这内在存有的所有特性都被加速：本知的、直觉的、创造的能力以远超乎你们所谓的“标准”速度在作用。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This is a dimension of existence native to consciousness, however, when it is not physically oriented. Ruburt can, and will, learn to explore this dimension even further. Only his lack of confidence in the past held him back.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，这却是一个意识本来的“存在次元”，当它不是肉体取向的时候。鲁柏有能力，而且也会更进一步地探索这次元，过去只是他的缺乏信心才使他未能前进。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The acceleration propels him into a state in which he can operate quite well, while going beyond all those normal psychological realities that he would personally call his own. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这加速把他推进到一个状态，在其中他能运作得相当好，同时超越了所有那些他个人会称为他自己的正常心理实相。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In such a state he literally uses incredible power, in terms of energy, now; and the volume of the voice in many cases is an attempt to help him use some of this, and discharge it, while he learns how to use it, and until he is taught other purposes to which it can be put. The volume, of course, can also be used as an excellent demonstration of the vitality with which he is in touch.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这样一个状态，他真的在用不可置信的力量，那是就“能量”；当他在学怎么用这能量，而直到他学到可以把它用上的其他目的之前。在许多情形下……当然，这能量也可用作他所接触到那种活力的精彩示范。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you can take a break. Finish your notes.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息，做完你的笔记。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Okay.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>And I will give Super-Jane a rest. (Pause, pointing to Sue): This one here is waiting for him to come back, so she can feel the difference.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>而我愿让“超人珍”休息一下。(停顿，指向苏：)此人在等他回来，以便她能感受到那个不同。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:37. Sue was on the edge of the couch, watching Jane closely as she came out of a deep trance. Once again she talked about the change in Jane’s “speeds.” “A sound goes along with those speeds that I can’t describe,” Sue said. “It’s like being in a dimension where music is the reality ---- where sound is more than just hearing things. Then when you leave it ---- “Sue whistled, imitating the Doppler effect of a train whistle receding into the distance.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:37。苏坐在沙发边沿，密切地注视着珍由很深的出神状态出来。她再一次谈论珍的“速度”改变，她说：“有一种声音伴随着我所不能描写的那些速度。就像是在一个音乐即其实相的次元里——在那儿，声音不止是听到东西了。然后当你离开它时——”苏吹着口哨，模仿火车汽笛消褪于远方的“多普勒”效应。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(When Sue and Jane questioned me about this, I had to tell them that I didn’t feel anything out of the ordinary, but then I seldom do during sessions. Concentrating on writing helps close out other effects also. I am always writing, it seems? just as I wrote through most of this break period.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(当苏与珍问我关于此事的时候，我必须告诉他们我并没觉得任何不寻常的事，但另一方面来说，我在课中很少感到什么不寻常的事。集中精神于写字也帮助我把其他的效应关在外面了。好像我永远在写——正如我在这段休息时间里也大半都在写字。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Again Sue watched Jane expectantly as we waited for Seth to return. “Wow, the acceleration’s terrific,” Sue exclaimed; and just before going back into trance, Jane told us she felt the chair vibrating beneath her…. Resume, with pauses, at 10:57.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(当我们在等赛斯回来时，苏又有所期待地注视着珍。“哇，那加速是太妙了！”她惊叹道；刚在回到出神状态之前，珍告诉我们，她感觉椅子在她身子下面振动……在10:57继续，时有停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Many of the experiences that Ruburt has during our sessions he cannot recall afterward. As physical objects are symbols, existing as realities within certain frequencies, so there are other realities, of course, at different frequencies; but here objects are not the main symbols.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在我们课里鲁柏有的许多经验，她事后都想不起来。因为“物体”就是象征，在某种频率的范围内存在好像实相一样，因此，当然在那些不同频率的范围，也就有其他的实相；但在那儿“物体”就不是主要的象征了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Experience within such a dimension is extremely difficult to translate when Ruburt is back within the physical system. On my part, there are also adjustments that must be made. I step down several levels for example, so that contact can be made.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当鲁柏回来物质系统内时，在这样一种次元里的经验是极难转译的。在我这一方，也有必须做的调整。举例来说，我降下来好几个层次以便达成接触。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I then attempt what is indeed a creative endeavor, in which Ruburt participates ---- the act of translating such inner data into physical terms, bringing into your reality those clues that I can bring you of these other realities of which you are part.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我然后再尝试作一种的确可说是创造性的努力，而鲁柏也参与其中——就是把这种内在资料转译成具体用语，并且把我能带来的这些实相——你们是其一部分——的那些线索带进你们的实相。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 11:00. In a quietly amused manner now, Seth was giving frequent instructions regarding punctuation, etc. Jane’s eyes were closed often.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在11:00停顿。现在赛斯以一种安静而觉得好玩的态度，常常给有关标点等等的指示。珍的眼睛常常闭着。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Seen or viewed from my natural perspective, your objects do not exist. Your inner reality does, of course. Now Ruburt’s system physically undergoes some changes, although these are largely native to his constitution. (Humorously): He saw to that before this life began.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>由我自然的视角来看，你们的“物体”并不存在。当然你们内在的实相是存在的。且说，鲁柏在身体上也经过一些改变，虽然这些对他的体质来说大半是自然的。(幽默地：)在此生开始前他就注意到那个问题了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>He uses nervous connections in a way that is unusual, and to his purpose. His pulse rate is normal. The acceleration begins, however, on a physical level, with the use of hormones and chemicals, and then leaps from there. Both halves of the brain spark, and from those connections, speaking physically now, the acceleration is initiated, and its effects on the body are cut off.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他以一种不寻常的、并符合他目的的方式来利用神经的连接，他的脉搏正常。然而，“加速”在一个肉体的层面上开始，同时用到了荷尔蒙与化学素，然后从那儿跃过神经末梢。脑的两半边都开动了，现在就肉体来说，“加速”就是由那些神经的连接发起的，而它在身体上的效应被切断了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Many cases of missing persons can be explained somewhat in the same manner: when the acceleration was strong enough, unexpected enough, to sweep the entire personality out of your system.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>许多失踪的个案可以多少以同样的方式来解释：当“加速”够强，又够突如其来的时候，就把这整个人格扫出了你们的系统。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now for our friend’s sake, I am speeding up the acceleration to see if she can perceive it. This often takes place during the dream state ---- and when it seems to you that you have briefly entered an astonishing new dimension, the dream state itself involves such an acceleration.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在为了我们朋友苏的缘故，我正在加快这“加速”作用，看看她是否能感知它。这常常在梦境里发生——当你似乎短暂地进入了一个令人惊愕的新次元时，那梦境本身就涉及了这样的一个“加速”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(As I wrote, I took a quick look at Sue, beside me. She sat very quietly, watching Jane. Jane’s eyes were open now, her pace faster, her voice somewhat louder.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我一边写字，一边很快地看了一眼坐在我旁边的苏。她安静地坐着，注视着珍。珍的眼睛现在是张开的，她的步调较快，她的声音略为大了些。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>To some extent or another, each artistic creation, though to a lesser degree, involves the same principle. Now, I cannot keep the additional acceleration up, or the voice will go so quickly that our friend cannot keep to his notes ?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>每个艺术性的创造多少都涉及了同样的原则，虽然是以一个较少的程度。现在，我不能再维持这额外的加速度了，否则我会说得这么快，使得我们的朋友没法记他的笔记了——</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane’s voice abruptly grew much louder with the last sentence ---- an effect Sue and I have witnessed often. This volume was far from her potential when speaking for Seth, however. On some occasions her voice has been so loud that my ears rang. I’ve heard Jane keep up very strong voice effects, with such ringing peaks, for an incredible several hours, and without any signs of strain afterward.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(随着最后一句话，珍的声音突然变大了许多——一个苏和我常常目击的效应。不过，当她为赛斯说话时，这音量离她的潜能还远得很呢。在有些场合她的声音那么大，使我的耳朵都嗡嗡作响。我曾听过珍非常大的声音效应，就带有如此响亮的尖锋，不可置信的一直维持了几小时之久，而在事后没有任何声嘶力竭的迹象。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, do not take notes….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在，不要记笔记……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(His loud and rapid voice soon quieting, Seth explained to me that he would give a “fine demonstration of an acceleration” in a session in which we used our recorder. Sue could sit in on it, and hopefully I would experience the acceleration as clearly as she does. This interlude ended in a break at 11:10.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(他又大又急速的声音很快地安静下来，赛斯向我解释，他将在我们用录音机的一节里给一个“加速的好示范”。苏也可以参加，而希望我也能像她一样清楚地体验到这加速。这个插曲在11:10的休息时结束。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(When Jane came out of trance, Sue was again “drastically aware of the drop” in Jane’s speed. She also had some visual effects that were hard to describe; in an effort to pin these down, she began adding to her own notes, and these are quoted at the end of the session.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(当珍脱离出神状态时，苏又一次“强烈地觉察到珍的速度遽减”。她也有一些难以描写的视觉上的效应；为了把这些感觉抓住，她开始补充她自己的笔记，而这些在此节之尾被引用。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Sometimes in ESP class, I could take the whole class with me on a real acceleration adventure, if they could go,” Jane said. She used the contrasting example of trees in a forest, comparing their passive state to the feeling of acceleration, of “being able to go right through the wall” that she sometimes gets. There was more here that I didn’t get down.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“有时在ESP班里，我可以带全班去作一次真正的‘加速探险’，如果他们去得成的话。”珍说。她用森林中的树木来作对照的例子，把它们的消极被动状态和加速相比，还有和她有时得到的“真的能够穿墙而过”的感觉相比。这儿有更多我没记下的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Resume at 11:20.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在11:20继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: I am going to end the session shortly. It was, of course, no coincidence that our friend came here this evening. Besides giving you necessary information for the Appendix, some of the information given on objects and symbolism definitely applied to Sue.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我很快就会结束此节。自然，我们的朋友今晚来此并非巧合，除了给你们为附录所需之资讯，我所给的论物体与象征的某些资讯毫无疑问也适用于苏。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(To me): I feel sorry for you ?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(对我：)我为你难过——</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Why?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“为什么？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Because you have been writing so steadily.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因为你一直不停的在写。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I’m okay.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我没什么。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There is one point I can add here, in connection with the religious drama of Christ and the disciples.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在此我可以对基督和门徒的宗教剧作一点补充。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As Ruburt said after reading the body of the book, the interior drama is the “real” one. Christ became the Crucified, Judas became the betrayer, though Christ was not crucified and Judas did not betray him. The reality, therefore, was in the myth. The reality was the myth. In such cases the interior events will always predominate, regardless of the physical facts, which are only symbols for those events.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>就像鲁柏读过此书的主要部分后说的，那内在的戏才是那“真的”戏。基督变成了“那被钉死的人”，犹大变成了那出卖者，虽然基督并没被钉死而犹大也没出卖他。因此，那真相就在那迷思里，那真相即那迷思。在这种情形，那些内在事件总是占优势的，不论实际发生的事实是什么，都只是那些内在事件的象征而已。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now I bid you a fond good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在我向你们道晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth. It’s been a pleasure.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。今晚听讲很愉快。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(To Sue): And I will let my friend, Ruburt, slide back down.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(对苏：)我要让我的朋友鲁柏滑回来了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Sue: “All right. Good night.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(苏：“好的，晚安。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:25 P.M. Once out of trance, Jane had little to say. “I’m just sitting here, watching you two busy bees,” she grinned, as Sue and I worked on our separate notes.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:25。一旦脱离出神状态，珍没什么要说的。“我只坐在这儿，看你们这两只忙碌的蜜蜂。”她笑着看苏和我分别忙我们的笔记。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Before break at 11:10,” Sue wrote, “when Seth told me that he was speeding up the acceleration to see if I could perceive it, I had the definite feeling of greater speed and a visual change in Jane’s body. It seemed to become smaller, as though I were looking at it through the wrong end of binoculars. This was again connected with motion, as though the physical frequency was also changed, and Jane’s body was rushing past me, even while staying in the same place.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(苏写道：“在11:10的休息之前，当赛斯告诉我，他正加快这“加速”看我能否觉察它时，我明确的感觉到更大速度并‘看见’珍的身体改变了。它似乎变小了，好像我是经由望远镜倒过来的一端来看它。这又与‘运动’连起来，好像那身体的‘频率’也变了，而珍的身体正很快地掠过了我，纵使当它停留在同一处的时候。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Then when Jane came out of trance at last break, I felt as though a force had been released in front of me, so that if I wasn’t careful I could topple over. And the same thing now, after the session.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“然后，当珍在上一次休息中由出神状态出来时，我感觉好像在我面前的一个力量被放走了，因此如果我不小心的话就会摔倒。而现在在课完后，我又有同样的感觉。”)</a>
