(一位外市的商人，约翰·巴克雷见证了此节。约翰如约带来一卷录音带，在带上他概述了数年来赛斯给他在职业方面的意见，以及它们成功与否的情形。结果很好。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(John Barclay, an out-of-town businessman, witnessed the session. John brought a tape with him, as he had promised. Upon it he had summarized the data Seth had given him about his professional life over a period of several years, and the ways in which it had, or had not, worked out. The results were good.</details>
(当有见证人在场时，珍常是如此，她开始以快速、有生气的步调讲话。她的眼睛大睁而且很黑，她的声音比平时要大，就好像她由约翰汲取了额外的能量而立即用上了它。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(As she often does when witnesses are present, Jane began her delivery at a fast and animated pace. Her eyes were wide open and very dark, her voice stronger than usual. It was as though she drew extra energy from John and put it to immediate use.)</details>
现在：晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Good evening.</details>
(约翰与我：“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(John and I: “Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
我们的朋友晚安。如果我给我的书作些口述，希望你不在意。在我能抓住他(指着我)时我一定得抓住他，如果我想把我的书写完的话。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Good evening to our friend here. I hope you will forgive me if I do some dictation on my book. I have to get him (pointing to me) when I can get him, if I want to get my book done.</details>
(心情极佳地：)我们正在写些冒险故事。那么，继续吧。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(In high good humor): Now: We are writing some saga. Resume dictation, then.</details>
鲁柏的一个学生对刚死那个时候的经验里有没有任何一种组织感到好奇。既然这是许多人心中都会有的疑问，我就在此谈谈它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>One of Ruburt’s students wondered whether or not there was any kind of organization in the immediate after-death experiences. Since this is a question that will come into many minds, I will deal with it here.</details>
首先，从我到此为止所说的一切，你们应该可以很明显的看出，并没有“一个”死后的实相，而是每一个经验都不相同。不过，一般说来，这些个人的经验会落入某些范围。例如，对那些仍旧强烈地聚焦于物质实相的人，以及对那些需要一段复原与休息时间的人，有一个最初的阶段，在这个层面有医院和疗养院，那些病人还没领悟到他们根本就没毛病。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>First of all, it should be obvious from what I have said so far that there is no one after-death reality, but [that] each experience is different. Generally speaking, however, there are dimensions into which these individual experiences will fall. For example, there is an initial stage for those who are still focused strongly in physical reality, and for those who need a period of recuperation and rest. On this level there will be hospitals and rest homes. The patients do not yet realize that there is nothing wrong with them at all.</details>
在有些案例里，对疾病的概念是这么强，以致他们在世的岁月是绕着这个心理中心而建立的。现在他们又把病况投射到新的身体上，就像以前投射到旧身体上一样。他们被给予各种不同的心灵性质治疗，而且告诉他们，他们身体的病况是来自自己的信念问题。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In some cases, the idea of illness is so strong that they have built their earthly years about this psychological center. They project ill conditions upon the new body as they did upon the old one. They are given various kinds of treatment of a psychic nature, and told that the condition of that body is being brought about by the nature of their own beliefs.</details>
(9:32)其实有许多人并不需要经过这个特定时期。不用说，医院和训练中心以你们的话来说是非物质的。事实上，它们常由实施这必要计划的向导们在共同维护。如果你愿意，你可称之为群体幻觉。事实上对那些接触到那实相的人，那些事件是相当真实的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:32.) Now, many individuals do not need to pass through this particular period. It goes without saying that the hospitals and training centers are not physical in your terms. They are often, in fact, maintained en masse by the guides who carry out the necessary plans. Now you may call this mass hallucination if you will. The fact is that to those encountering that reality, the events are quite real.</details>
也还有训练中心，在这儿按照一个人了解与感知的能力，为他解释实相的本质。至少在最初对某些人仍用熟悉的比喻，然后才逐渐让这些人把它放弃。在这些中心有某些课程，对那选择回到人世的人给予一些指导。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There are also training centers. In these the nature of reality is explained in accordance with an individual’s ability to understand and perceive it. The familiar parables, for some, will still be used at least initially, and then these individuals will be gradually weaned away from them. In these centers there are certain classes in which instruction is given for the benefit of those who chose to return to the physical environment.</details>
换言之，他们被教会把情感与思想转译成具体现实的方法。在这里不像三次元系统，在这种思想的开始与它们的具体化之间，是没有时间之隔的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They are taught, in other words, the methods that allow them to translate emotion and thought into physical actuality. There is no time lag, as there must be in the three-dimensional system, between the initiation of such thoughts and their materialization.</details>
所有这些或多或少在同一个层面发生，不过你必须了解，此处我把问题简化了。例如，有些人不经过任何这样的时期，却由于他们在前生的发展与进步，已准备好开始更有雄心的计划了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>All of this occurs more or less at one level, though you must understand that I am simplifying the issues here to some extent. For example, some individuals do not undergo any such periods, but because of development and progress during their past lives, they are ready to begin more ambitious programs.</details>
先前已谈到过这种发展。我有些读者也许没察觉自己任何的心灵能力，也许会以为他们注定要有个拖得极长的死后训练了。让我赶快告诉你，所有这种能力并不一定是有意识的，而且有许多是你在睡眠状态不知不觉时发生的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now I have spoken of such development earlier. Some of my readers, not being perhaps aware of any psychic ability of their own, might think then that they are in for a long and protracted period of after-death training. Let me hasten to tell you that all such ability is not necessarily conscious, and that much of it takes place during the sleep state when you are simply not aware of it.</details>
现在我建议你休息一会儿，我们会回来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now I suggest your break, and we will return.</details>
(“但愿如此。”我开玩笑地说。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“I hope so,” I said, joking.)</details>
我总是回来的，像个坏钱币，你没法甩掉我。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I always do. Like a bad penny, you cannot get rid of me.</details>
(“好吧。”9:42—9:58。)在死后你也许全然拒绝相信你真的死了，还继续把你的情感能量集中在前生所知的那些人身上。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“All right.” 9:42 to 9:58.) Now: You may after death utterly refuse to believe that you are dead, and continue to focus your emotional energy toward those you have known in life.</details>
好比说，如果你曾执迷于某一个特定的计划，你可能试想去完成它。永远会有向导来帮助你了解你的情况，但你可能如此全神贯注而对他们全不留意。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>If you have been obsessed with a particular project, for example, you may try to complete it. There are always guides to help you understand your situation, but you may be so engrossed that you pay them no heed.</details>
我不在这一章谈鬼的问题，以后再另行讨论。现在我只说，对物质实相大量的情感贯注，可能阻挡你进一步的发展就够了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: I will cover the subject of ghosts separately, rather than in this chapter. Suffice it to say that large fields of emotional focus toward physical reality can hold you back from further development.</details>
当意识离开了身体，走开有好一段时间，那么联系当然就断了。在“出体”的情况联系仍然在。那么一个已死的人很可能完全误解了死亡经验而试图再进入尸体。当此人几乎唯独与他的肉体形象认同时，可能发生这种事。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>When consciousness leaves the body and is away for some time then the connection is, of course, broken. In out-of-body states the connection still holds. Now it is possible for an individual who has died to completely misinterpret the experience and attempt to reenter the corpse. This can happen when the personality identified himself almost exclusively with the physical image.</details>
这是不常有的。但无论如何，在各种不同的情况下，这种人将试图再度发动肉体机制，当他们发现了肉体的情况时，会变得更惊恐。举例来说，有些“人”在凭吊者走了很久之后，仍在尸体旁悲哭，而没领悟到，好比说，在那些肉体有病或内脏已不能修复的地方，他们自己却是健康完整的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is not common. But nevertheless, under various circumstances, such individuals will attempt to reactivate the physical mechanism, becoming more panicstricken when they discover the body’s condition. Some, for example, have wept over the corpse long after the mourners have left, not realizing that they themselves are completely whole ---- where, for example, the body may have been ill or the organs beyond repair.</details>
他们就像是担心埋藏好骨头的狗。至于那些没有把意识完全与肉体认同的人，就发现远较容易离开它。够奇怪的是，那些生前憎恨肉体的人反倒发现，在刚死的时候他们很被它吸引。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They are like a dog worrying a bone. Those who have not identified their consciousness with the body completely, find it much easier to leave it. Those who have Hated the body find, strangely enough, that immediately after death they are quite drawn to it.</details>
(10:07)那么，按照所涉及的人，所有这些情况可能发生，或可能不发生。可是，在离开肉体之后，你将立刻发现自己在另一个“身体”里。这是与在“出体”时你用以旅游的同样形体，让我再一次提醒我的读者，每一个人在每晚睡眠中都会离开身体一会儿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:07.) All of these circumstances then may or may not occur according to the individual involved. However, after leaving the physical body, you will immediately find yourself in another. This is the same kind of form in which you travel in out-of-body projections, and again let me remind my readers that each of them leaves the body for some time each night during sleep.</details>
这形体看起来会像是具体的。但一般说来仍在肉体内的人看不到它。它可以做任何你现在在梦中所做的事，所以它会飞，会穿过固态的物件，它是由你的意志直接推动的，你想到哪儿就到哪儿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This form will seem physical. It will not be seen by those still in the physical body however, generally speaking. It can do anything that you do now in your dreams. Therefore it flies, goes through solid objects, and is moved directly by your will, taking you, say, from one location to another as you may think of these locations.</details>
好比，如果你心想，不知道住在纽约州普市的莎莉婶在做什么？那么你会发现你自己在那儿。可是，通常你不能操纵物质的东西，你不能拿起一架台灯或掷一只盘子。你一死这身体立刻就是你的，但它不是你将有的唯一的形相。就此而言，这不是个新的形相，它现在就与你的肉体交缠，但你不会知觉到它。在你死后的一段时间内，它将是你所知觉的唯一身体。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>If you wonder what Aunt Sally is doing in, say, Poughkeepsie, New York, then you will find yourself there. However, you cannot as a rule manipulate physical objects . You cannot pick up a lamp or throw a dish. This body is yours instantly, but it is not the only form that you will have. For that matter, this image is not a new one. It is interwound with your physical body now, but you do not perceive it. Following death, it will be the only body you are aware of for some time.</details>
(在10:15暂停。)很久之后，在许多层面上，你终将学会按你有意识的选择而采取许多形相。你可明白以某一种方式来说，你现在就在这样做，将你的心理经验——你的思想与情感——十分确实却不自知的转译为物质的东西。在你死后，当你想象自己是个孩子的时候，你可能突然发现你具有那孩子的形相。所以，有那么一段时间你可以操纵这死后的形相，使它以你上一生任何时期的样子出现。你也许在八十岁去世，在死后想到你在二十岁时的青春和活力，于是就会发现你的形相依照这内在形相而改变。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pause at 10:15.) Much later and on many levels you will finally learn to take many forms, as you choose, consciously. In one manner of speaking you do this now, you see, translating your psychological experience ---- your thoughts and feelings ---- quite literally but unconsciously into physical objects . You may find that when you imagine yourself as a child ---- after death ---- that you suddenly have the form of the child that you were. For a certain period of time, therefore, you can manipulate this form so that it takes any appearance that it had when it was connected with your physical form in the immediately previous physical life. You may die at eighty and after death think of the youth and vitality that you had at twenty, and find then that your form changes to correspond with this inner image.</details>
大多数人在死后选择一个较成熟的形象，那通常会与肉体能力的顶峰时期相符，不论肉体的顶峰是在何时达到的。相反的，另一些人选取，当他们达成了最伟大精神或情感高峰时的那个形相，而不在乎美貌或年龄。你懂吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Most individuals after death choose a more mature image that usually corresponds to the peak physical abilities, regardless of the age when the physical peak was reached. Others choose instead to take the form they had at the particular point when the greatestmental or emotional heights were achieved, regardless of the beauty or age that characterized the form. Do you follow me?</details>
(“我懂。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Yes.”)</details>
因此，你会对所选择的形相感到满意，当你想与其他你已认识的人沟通时，你通常会用它。虽然，反过来说，在与生者作此种沟通时，你也许会用你想接触的那个人所认识的你的模样。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You will feel comfortable with the form that you choose, therefore, and you will usually use it when you want to communicate with others you have known; though for such communications with the living, you may instead adopt the form you had when you were known to the individual you want to contact.</details>
现在你可以休息一下，我将再与你接触。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take a break, and I will contact you again.</details>
(身为赛斯，珍指着坐在我身边的约翰·巴克雷。今天下午约翰曾参加一个和他的业务有关的聚会，在那儿有香槟酒供应，他现在有睡意……)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(As Seth, Jane pointed to John Barclay, sitting beside me on the couch. In connection with his business, John had attended a gathering this afternoon at which champagne had been served; he was now sleepy….)</details>
他是在梦境。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>He is in the dream state.</details>
(“看来如此。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“He looks it.”</details>
(约翰微笑：“只是试想渐渐听懂你的话，赛斯。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(John, smiling: “Just trying to follow you, Seth. Slowly.”</details>
(10:25—10:37。赛斯终于打断了珍、约翰和我在休息时的长谈。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:25 to 10:37. Seth finally broke into a long conversation Jane, John, and I were having during our break.)</details>
现在：我可以继续口述吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: May I continue dictation?</details>
这些死后环境不一定存在于其他的星球上。它们不占空间，因此“所有这些在哪儿发生？”这问题基本上是无意义的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>These after-death environments do not exist necessarily on other planets. They do not take up space, so the question, “Where does all this happen?” is meaningless in basic terms.</details>
这是你们自己对实相本质误解的结果。因此没有一个地方，没有一个特定的地点。这些环境存在于你所知道的物质世界之中而不为你们知觉。其实只是你们的感知机制不允许你调准到它们频率的范围而已。你只对一极为特定而有限的范围反应。如我以前说过的，其他的实相与你的实相共存。在死时你只是舍弃了自己的物质行头，对不同的范围调频，并且对另一套设定反应而已。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is the result of your own misinterpretations of the nature of reality. There is no one place therefore, no specific location. These environments exist unperceived by you amid the physical world that you know. Your perceptive mechanisms simply do not allow you to tune in to their ranges. You react to a highly specific but limited field. As I mentioned earlier, other realities coexist with your own at death, for example. You simply divest yourself of physical paraphernalia, tune into different fields, and react to other sets of assumptions.</details>
(10:43)由这另一个观点，你可以在某范围内感知物质实相。不过，的确有分隔它们的能量场。你全盘的空间观念是如此扭曲，使得任何真正的解释都极为困难。请等我们一会儿。(停顿。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:43.) From this other viewpoint, you can to some extent perceive physical reality. However, there are energy fields that do separate them. Your entire concept of space is so distorted that any true explanation is highly difficult. Give us a moment. (Pause.)</details>
举例来说，既然你的感知机制坚持物体是固态的，因此它们坚持像“空间”这样的一件东西是存在的。其实你的感官告诉你关于物质的本质是完全错误的，而它们告诉你关于“空间”的观念也是一样的错——对基本真实来说是错的，但当然跟三次元观念是符合的。(幽默地：)在活着时的“出体”经验中，遭遇到许多与“空间”有关的问题，在死后也会遇到。所以，在这些插曲里，“时间”与“空间”的真正性质变得更明显了。例如，在死后，经过“空间”不必费“时间”。“空间”也不以距离的说法存在。时、空都是幻觉。的确有阻碍存在，但都是精神或心灵上的阻碍。例如，有些经验的强度在你的实相里是以几里几里的距离来诠释的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>As your perceptive mechanisms insist that objects are solid, for example, so they insist that such a thing as space exists. Now what your senses tell you about the nature of matter is entirely erroneous, and what they tell you about space is equally wrong ---- wrong in terms of basic reality, but quite in keeping of course with three-dimensional concepts. (Humorously): In out-of-body experiences from the living state, many of the problems are encountered, in terms of space, that will be met after death. And in such episodes, therefore, the true nature of time and space becomes more apparent. After death it does not take time to go through space, for example. Space does not exist in terms of distance. This is illusion . There are barriers, but they aremental or psychic barriers. For example, there are intensities of experience that are interpreted in your reality as distance in miles.</details>
在死后你可能发现自己在一个训练中心。理论上说，这中心在物理空间来说可能就在你现在客厅的中央，但在你与你仍活着的家人——也许坐在那儿想你或看报——中间的距离与你所知的空间毫不相干。你与他们分离得比假如你在月球上还要远。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>After death you may find yourself in a training center. Now theoretically, this center could be in the middle of your present living room, in physical space, but the distance between you and the members of your family still living ---- sitting perhaps, thinking of you or reading a paper ---- would have nothing to do with space as you know it. You would be more separated from them than if you were, say, on the moon.</details>
理论上，你也许可以改变自己注意力的焦点，离开那训练中心而看到这房间和它的住客；但是隔在你们中间的，却仍然是与里数无关的距离。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You could perhaps change your own focus of attention away from the center, and theoretically see the room and its inhabitants; and yet still this distance that has nothing to do with miles would be between you.</details>
(10:55)口述完毕。我怕我会使我们这儿的朋友睡着。(珍身为赛斯，指着约翰。他笑了。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:55.) End of dictation. I am afraid I would put my friend to sleep over here. (Jane, as Seth, pointed to John. He laughed.</details>
(约翰：“抱歉我给你那种印象，赛斯。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(John: “Sorry I’ve given you that impression, Seth.”)</details>
那是个真的印象。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It was a true impression.</details>
(约翰：“我今晚该挨骂了。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(John: “I’m gonna catch it tonight.”)</details>
现在：你们有什么问题吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Do you have any questions?</details>
(约翰：“只是一般性的，没有任何特殊的……”约翰于是与赛斯聊了一会儿，课于11:04结束。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(John: “Just generally. Nothing specific….” John and Seth then engaged in a brief conversation, and the session ended at 11:04 P.M.</details>
(我为这节所做的原笔录包括赛斯昨晚，1970年6月23日，在珍的ESP班上的谈话。赛斯在那节中也谈到组织——但是除了别的实相的组织，也还谈到在我们自己实相内的组织。既然那一课回答了珍和我常问的问题，我们把它几乎整个地包括在附录里。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(My original notes for this session included Seth’s long delivery in Jane’s ESP class last night, June 23, 1970. Seth dealt with organization in that session also ---- but organization within our own reality as well as in others. Since that session answers questions Jane and I are often asked, we’ve included it in the Appendix almost in its entirety.)</details>
