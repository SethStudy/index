〈自序〉揭露宇宙奥秘的创造性冒险<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>INTRODUCTION</details>
这本书是个叫“赛斯”(Seth)的人物所写的，他自称是一个“能量人格元素”(energy personality essence)，已不再贯注于肉身的形式里。他每周两次透过我来说话已有七年之久。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This book was written by a personality called Seth, who speaks of himself as an “energy personality essence” no longer focused in physical form. He has been speaking through me for over seven years now, in twice weekly trance sessions.</details>
然而，我的通灵(psychic)能力的开启实在是始于1963年9月的一个晚上，当我正在写诗时，突然间我的意识离开了身体，而一些惊人且新奇的概念如弹雨般轰击我的心智(mind)。在回到我的身体之后，我发现我的手已自动写出了一篇东西，解释了其中许多的观念，这篇东西甚至还有个标题——“物质宇宙即意念建构”(The Physical Universe as Idea Construction)。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My psychic initiation really began one evening in September, 1963, however, as I sat writing poetry. Suddenly my consciousness left my body, and my mind was barraged by ideas that were astonishing and new to me at the time. On return to my body, I discovered that my hands had produced an automatic script, explaining many of the concepts that I’d been given. The notes were even titled ---- The Physical Universe as idea construction.</details>
因为那次经验，我开始钻研通灵活动(phychic activity)，并且计划就这个题目写本书。为此，在1963年尾，我的先生罗(Rob)和我用一个灵应盘(Ouija board，译注：类似我们的碟仙)来试验。在最初几次之后，指针拼出了自称来自“赛斯”的讯息。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Because of that experience, I began doing research into psychic activity, and planned a book on the project. In line with this, my husband, Rob, and I experimented with a Ouija board late in 1963. After the first few sessions, the pointer spelled out messages that claimed to come from a personality called Seth.</details>
罗或我都没有任何通灵方面的背景，而当我开始在心里“预知”灵应盘的回答时，我以为那一定是来自我的潜意识。然而，过不了多久，我觉得非把答案大声说出来不可，而在一个月之内，我就在出神状态(trance state)中替赛斯说话了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Neither Rob or I had any psychic background, and when I began to anticipate the board’s replies, I took it for granted that they were coming from my subconscious. Not long after, however, I felt impelled to say the words aloud, and within a month I was speaking for Seth while in a trance state.</details>
这些讯息似乎是由“意念建构”结束处开始的，后来赛斯说我的意识扩展(expansion of consciousness)经验代表了他首次与我接触的尝试。从那以后，赛斯陆续传送来的文稿，到现在已累积六千多页打字纸了，我们叫它“赛斯资料”，它谈到像物质的性质、时间、实相(reality)、神的观念、可能的宇宙、健康与转世等问题。从一开始，这资料显明的优秀性即引起了我们的兴趣，也就是为此之故我们才继续下去。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The messages seemed to begin where idea construction left off, and later Seth said that my expansion of consciousness experience had represented his first attempt at contact. Since then, Seth has delivered a continuing manuscript that now totals over six thousand typewritten pages. We call it the Seth material, and it deals with such topics as the nature of physical matter, time, and reality, the god concept, probable universes, health, and reincarnation. From the beginning, the obvious quality of the material intrigued us, and it was for this reason that we continued.</details>
随着我在这方面的第一本书出版之后，便接到陌生人求助于赛斯的信。我们为那些最需要帮助的人举行“赛斯课”(Seth session)。其中许多人因住在美国其他各地而不克出席，但赛斯的劝告却帮助了他们，而他借信件所给的有关个人背景的资料也都正确无误。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Following the publication of my first book in this field, letters came from strangers asking for Seth’s help. We held sessions for those most in need. Many of the people involved couldn’t attend, since they lived in other parts of the country, yet Seth’s advice helped them, and the information he gave by mail concerning individual backgrounds was correct.</details>
对赛斯课，罗一直是逐字逐句用他自创的速记方法作笔记，过后在一周内他将之打字下来，把它们加进我们“赛斯资料”的收藏里。罗的精彩注记突显了赛斯课发生于其中活生生的架构，他的支持和鼓励是无价的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Rob has always taken verbatim notes of the Seth sessions, using his own shorthand system. Later in the week he types them and adds them to our collection of Seth material. Rob’s excellent notes point up the living framework in which the sessions take place. His support and encouragement have been invaluable.</details>
依我们自己想来，我们已与“宇宙”约会了六百多次——虽则罗自己绝不会那样形容它。这些约会就发生在我们灯火通明的大客厅里，但更深入地说，它们是发生在人类人格无垠无涯的领域之内。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>To our way of thinking, we have kept over six hundred appointments with the universe ---- though Rob would never describe it that way himself. These appointments are kept in our well-lighted, large living room, but in deeper terms they take place within the spaceless area of human personality.</details>
我并无意暗示我们已获得了任何对真理的基本观念，也无意给人一个印象：我们在屏息以待“未遭扭曲的世代秘密”倾泄而出。我只确知每个人都能通达直觉的知识，而得以略见他的内心世界之一斑。“宇宙”就这一点对我们每个人说话。对我们而言，“赛斯课”就是发生这种沟通的一个架构。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I do not mean to imply that we have any cornerstone on truth, or give the impression that we wait breathlessly for the undistorted secrets of the ages to gush forth. I do know that each individual has access to intuitional knowledge and can gain glimpses of inner reality. The universe speaks to each of us in this regard. In our case, the Seth sessions are the framework in which this kind of communication takes place.</details>
在1970年出版的“赛斯资料”——《灵界的讯息》里，我解释了这些事，并以赛斯课的摘录表明了在各种不同题目上赛斯的看法。我也描写了当我们试着了解我们的经验，并将之置入正常生活脉络内的时候，我们与心理学家以及超心理学家接触的经过。也描写了我们为证实赛斯真的具备千里眼(clairvoyant)能力所做的测验。对我们来说，他胜利地过了关。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In The Seth Material, published in 1970, I explained these events and gave Seth’s views on a variety of subjects with excerpts from the sessions. I also described our encounters with psychologists and parapsychologists, as we tried to understand our experiences and place them within the context of normal life. The tests we conducted to verify Seth’s clairvoyant abilities were also described. As far as we are concerned, he came through with flying colors.</details>
从日渐增多的赛斯资料中选择一些有关任一题目的摘录是极为困难的。因此之故，《灵界的讯息》那本书必然留下了许多未答复的问题和未探索的题目。然而，在它完成了两周之后，赛斯口述了目前这本书的大纲，在这文稿里他将可自由地以他的方式将想法写成书。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It was extremely difficult to choose a few excerpts on any given topic from Seth’s growing body of work. As a result, The Seth Material necessarily left many questions unanswered and many topics unexplored. Two weeks after it was finished, however, Seth dictated the outline for this present manuscript, in which he would be free to state his ideas in his own way, in book form.</details>
以下是在1970年1月19日第510节所给的大纲的一个副本。如你们将看到的，赛斯叫我鲁柏(Ruburt)，而叫罗为约瑟(Joseph)。这些名字代表我们整个的人格，以别于处于目前肉身里的我们。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Here is a copy of that outline, which was given to us in Session 510, January 19, 1970. As you’ll see here, Seth calls me Ruburt, and Rob, Joseph. These names represent our entire personalities as distinguished from our present physically oriented selves.</details>
我现在正忙着准备给你们另一些资料，因此你们必须再忍耐一会儿。好比说，我愿告诉你们我自己这本书的一些内容，它将会涉及许多问题。此书将描写关于它写成的方式，以及我自己的意念能由鲁柏说出来，甚或能以语言转译，这其间的必要过程。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am working on some other material just now that you will be given, and so you must bear with me for a few moments. For example, I would like to give you some idea of the contents of my own book. Many issues will be involved. The book will include a description of the way in which it is being written, and the procedures necessary so that my own ideas can be spoken by Ruburt, or for that matter translated at all, in vocal terms.</details>
我不具肉身，但我却将写一本书。第一章将解释我如何及为何写这本书。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I do not have a physical body, and yet I will be writing a book. The first chapter will explain how and why.</details>
(到现在珍的步调明显地慢了下来，她的眼睛常常闭着，她停顿了许多次，有几次停了很久。〔罗的附记〕)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(By now [Rob wrote in his notes] Jane’s pace had slowed considerably, and her eyes were often closed. She took many pauses, some of them long.)</details>
下一章将描写你可称之为我目前的环境是什么；我目前的“特性”，以及我的同事们。这是指我接触的其他那些“人”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will describe what you may call my present environment; my present “characteristics,” and my associates. By this I mean those others with whom I come in contact.</details>
再下一章将描写我的工作，以及它带我进入的那些实相的次元(dimensions)，因为正如我旅游到你们的实相，我也到其他的实相，以完成我应完成的目的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will describe my work, and those dimensions of reality into which it takes me, for as I travel into your reality I also travel into others, to fulfill that purpose which is mine to fill.</details>
再下一章将谈谈对你们来说的“我的过去”，以及我曾“当过”哪些人和认识哪些人。同时我要明白指出并无过去、现在或未来，并且解释，虽则我可能用“过去的生活”这种说法，这其中并无矛盾。这可能要花上两章。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will deal with my past in your terms, and some of those personalities that I have been and have known. At the same time I will make it clear that there is no past, present, or future, and explain that there is no contradiction even though I may speak in terms of past existences. This may possibly run two chapters.</details>
再下一章将谈到我们相遇的故事——你(对我说)、鲁柏和我，自然是以我的观点来说，以及早在你们知道任何通灵现象或我的存在之前，我接触鲁柏内在知觉的方式。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will give the story of our meeting ---- you (to me), Ruburt and I, from my viewpoint of course, and the ways in which I contacted Ruburt’s inner awareness long before either of you knew anything about psychic phenomena, or my existence.</details>
再下一章将谈谈人在死亡那一刻的经验，以及在这基本探险上的许多变化。我会以我自己的几次死亡作例子。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will deal with the experience of any personality at the point of death, and with the many variations on this basic adventure. I will use some of my own deaths as examples.</details>
再下一章将谈到死后的存在及其多种变化。这两章都将谈到与死亡有关的转世，并将强调最后一次投生结束时的死亡。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will deal with existence after death, with its many variations. Both of these chapters will bear on reincarnation as it applies to death, and some emphasis will also be given to death at the end of the last incarnation.</details>
下一章将谈到各人格之间爱与亲属关系的感情实相——说到在连续的转世间这些感情的演变情形，因为有些遗落在路边而有些维持了下去。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will deal with the emotional realities of love and kinship between personalities ---- with what happens to these during succeeding incarnations, for some fall by the wayside and some are retained.</details>
下一章将谈到对我和其他像我的“人”来说，你们的物质实相看起来如何。这一章将包含些颇为迷人的要点，因为你们不仅造成了你们所知的物质实相，而且也以你们目前的思想、欲望和情感，在其他的实相里形成其他十分确实有据(valid)的环境。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will deal with your physical reality as it appears to me and others like me. This chapter will contain some rather fascinating points, for not only do you form the physical reality that you know, but you are also forming other quite valid environments in other realities by your present thoughts, desires and emotions.</details>
下一章将谈到“梦”永远可作为进入这些其他实相的门户，以及作为一个开放地区，经由这开放地区，“内我”瞥见它的经验的许多面，并与其实相的其他层面沟通。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will deal with the eternal validity of dreams as gateways into these other realities, and as open areas through which the “inner self” glimpses the many facets of its experience and communicates with other levels of its reality.</details>
下一章将更深入地谈谈这题目，重述做为教师和向导我进入别人梦境的各种方法。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will deal further with this subject, as I relate the various ways that I have entered the dreams of others, both as an instructor and as a guide.</details>
下一章将谈到任何意识——不论它是否具形体——按照它的程度所用的基本沟通之法。话题将转而谈论，如你们所了解的人类所用的基本沟通之法，而指出这些内在的沟通是独立存在于肉体感官之外的，而肉体感官只不过是内在知觉的延伸而已。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will deal with the basic methods of communication that are used by any consciousness, according to its degree, whether or not it is physical. This will lead up to the basic communication used by human personalities as you understand them, and point out these inner communications as existing independently of the physical senses, which are merely physical extensions of inner perception.</details>
我会告诉读者他如何及为何看到他所看到的，或听到他所听到的。我希望透过这整本书让读者明白他自己是独立于他的肉体形象之外的，而我希望由我自己来给他一些得以证实我的理论的方法。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I will tell the reader how he sees what he sees, or hears what he hears, and why. I hope to show through the entire book that the reader himself is independent of his physical image, and I hope, myself, to give him some methods that will prove my thesis to him.</details>
下一章将谈到在我所有的存在中，我与那些我在资料中谈到过的“金字塔完形”(pyramid gestalts)有过些什么经验，以及关于我与你们称为“赛斯二”(Seth Tow)及远较我进化的“多次元意识”间的关系。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The next chapter will relate what experience I have had in all my existences with those “pyramid gestalts” of which I speak in the material, and about my own relationship with the personality you call Seth Two, and with multidimensional consciousnesses far more evolved than I.</details>
我给读者的讯息将是：基本上来说，你们不比我更是个具肉身的人。在告诉你们关于我的实相时，我也告诉了你们你们的实相。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My message to the reader will be: “Basically, you are no more of a physical personality than I am, and in telling you of my reality I tell you of your own.”</details>
有一章将探讨世界上的宗教，及在它们内的曲解和真理；“三位”基督；及关于一个失落的宗教的一些资料，它属于一个你们毫无所知的民族。在你们的地球存在“之前”，这些人住在占据和你们现在的地球同一空间的一个行星上。他们由于自己的错误毁灭了它，而当你们的行星准备好了时，他们便再转生于地球上。他们的记忆成为你们现在所知的宗教诞生的基础。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There will be a chapter on the religions of the world, on the distortions and truths within them; the three Christs; and some data concerning a lost religion, belonging to a people of which you have no information. These people lived on a planet in the same space that your earth now occupies, “before” your planet existed. They destroyed it through their own error, and were reincarnated when your planet was prepared. Their memories became the basis for the birth of religion as you now think of it.</details>
有一章会谈到可能的神祇和可能的系统。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There will be a chapter on probable gods and probable systems.</details>
有一章专门回答问题。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There will be a question and answer chapter.</details>
在最后一章里，我会叫读者闭上眼睛，而对我存在的实相及他自己的内在实相有所知觉。我会教你们一些方法。在此章里，我会邀请读者用他的“内在感官”以他自己的方式来看我。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There will be a final chapter in which I will ask the reader to close his eyes and become aware of the reality in which I exist, and of his own inner reality. I will give the methods. In this chapter I will invite the reader to use his “inner senses,” to see me in his own way.</details>
虽然为了保护资料的完整一贯性，我的通讯始终将透过鲁柏作独家报导，我还是要邀请读者知觉到有我这么一个“人”的存在，因而他能明了由其他实相来的通讯是可能的，并且他自己也能接受非属肉体的知觉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>While my communications will come exclusively through Ruburt at all times, to protect the integrity of the material, I will invite the reader to become aware of me as a personality, so that he may then realize that communication from other realities is possible, and that he himself is therefore open to perception that is not physical.</details>
那么这就是本书的大纲，但它只大略勾勒出我的意向而已。我没有给一个更完满的大纲，因为我不要鲁柏对我有所预期。我将透彻地讨论这种通讯所涉及的困难，指明所谓的超常通讯(paranormal communication)是由各种不同的实相层面而来，并且那些通讯说明了它们存在于其中的实相。因此我会描写我的及其他我所知的实相。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now this is my outline for the book, but it contains merely a sketch of my intentions. I am not giving a fuller outline, for I do not want Ruburt to anticipate me. The difficulties involved in such communications will be given thoroughly. It will be made clear that so-called paranormal communications come from various levels of reality, and that those communications describe the reality in which they exist. So I will describe mine, and others of which I have knowledge.</details>
这并不是说我所不知的其他次元是不存在的。在我们的课里我将会口述此书。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This is not to say that other dimensions do not exist of which I am ignorant. I will dictate the book during our sessions.</details>
这是我们的书的标题(面带微笑)：《赛斯如是说：灵魂永生》(Seth Speaks:The Eternal Validity of the Soul)。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This is the title for our book (smile): Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul.</details>
我用“灵魂”这个名词，因为它对大多数读者而言立即有其意义。我建议你为自己准备些好的笔。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am using the term soul, for it will have instant meaning to most readers. I suggest you equip yourself with some good pens.</details>
正因为我熟知写一本书所费的力气，所以当赛斯说要写本他自己的书时，我颇为戒慎，虽然我明知他做得到，但心中仍不免犯嘀咕：“不错，‘赛斯资料’是真的很重要，但赛斯知道怎么样写书吗？他知道所需的组织，或如何针对公众说话吗？”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Precisely because I am acquainted with the effort involved in writing a book, I was cautious when Seth spoke of writing his own. Though I knew perfectly well that he could do it, a nagging part of me questioned. “Granted, the Seth material is really significant, but what does Seth know about writing books? About the organization required? Or about directing himself to the public?”</details>
罗一直叫我别为此担心。朋友和学生们似觉惊异，在所有人之中偏偏我倒有疑问。但我想，在所有人中，除了我谁还“该”有疑问？赛斯已说出了写书的意图，但他能完成它吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Rob kept telling me not to worry about it. Friends and students seemed astonished that of all people, I should have any doubts, but I thought ---- of all people, who else should have doubts? Here was a stated intent. Could Seth follow through?</details>
赛斯在下一课——1970年1月21日的第511节——开始口述，这本书在1971年 8月11日第591节大功告成。不过，其间的课并非全都涉及写书的工作，有些是专为私人的事，有些是给需要帮助的某些人，有些是回答与书无关的哲学问题。我也有过几次“小休假”。纵使有这种中断，赛斯总是立刻精确地接上他口述中止的地方。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Seth began dictating the book in our next Session 511, January 21, 1970, and finished it in Session 591, August 11, 1971. The intervening sessions did not all involve book dictation, however. Some were devoted to personal matter, some given for specific people who needed help, and some were in answer to philosophical questions not connected with the book. I also took several “little vacations.” Despite such layoffs, Seth always picked right up, precisely where he left off dictation.</details>
在他写“他的书”的期间，我每天花四小时写我自己的书，指导我每周一次的ESP班，并发现我自己被《灵界的讯息》出版后的读者来信所淹没。我同时还开办一周一次的创作班。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>During the time that he was working on his book, I was writing four hours a day on a book of my own, conducting my weekly ESP class, and finding myself swamped by the correspondence that followed publication of The Seth Material. I also began holding a weekly class in creative writing.</details>
出于好奇我看了赛斯书的头几章，后来就不再碰了。偶尔罗告诉我一些他认为我的学生可能会特别感兴趣的片段。除此之外我对这书不予注意，放心满意让赛斯去弄。一般而言，我不把他的工作放在心上，甚至几个月都不看他的草稿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Out of curiosity, I looked over a few of the early chapters of Seth’s book, then stayed away from it. Occasionally Rob told me about a few passages that he thought my students might be particularly interested in. Otherwise I paid no attention to the book, being content to let Seth do it. Generally speaking, I put his work out of my mind, and didn’t even see the manuscript for months at a time.</details>
阅读这完成了的书是个愉快的经验。整体而言它对我是全新的，虽然每个字都是由我的嘴说出来的，而我曾奉献许多个夜晚在出神状态来制作它。这点对我来说格外的奇怪，因为我自己是个作家，惯于组织我自己的资料，追踪它，并且像个母鸡般地呵护它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Reading the finished book was a delightful experience. As a whole it was completely new to me, though each word had been spoken through my lips, and I had devoted many evenings in trance to its production. This was particularly strange to me since I am a writer myself, used to organizing my own material, keeping track of it, and hovering over it like a mother hen.</details>
由于我自己的写作经验，我也熟知把无意识的资料转译为有意识实相的过程。这在我写诗时格外明显。不论赛斯的书还涉及了别的什么，显然某种无意识的活动是在“高速档”运转。那么，很自然地，我发现自己在比较我有意识的创作经验与赛斯书所涉及的出神状态的过程，我想要发现我为什么感到赛斯的书是“他的”，而我的书是“我的”。如果两者皆由同一个无意识而来，那么为什么在我的感觉里有主观上的不同？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Because of my own writing experience, I’m also well aware of the process involved in translating unconscious material into conscious reality. It’s particularly obvious when I’m working on poetry. Whatever else is involved in Seth’s book, certainly some kind of unconscious activity is operating at high gear. It was only natural, then, that I found myself comparing my own conscious creative experience with the trance procedure involved in Seth’s book. I wanted to discover why I felt that Seth’s book was his, as divorced from mine. If both were coming from the same unconscious, then why the subjective differences in my feelings?</details>
从一开始这些“不同”就很明显。当在写一首诗，我沉浸在灵感里时，那时我很“来电”、很兴奋，充满了一种急迫感与发现感。但是，正在这些发生之前，一个构想似乎无中生有地来了。它是“现成的”，就这么突然出现了，而由它涌出了连绵不绝的新创意。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>These differences were obvious from the first. When I’m caught up in inspiration, writing a poem, then I’m “turned on,” excited, filled with a sense of urgency, and discovery. Just before this happens, however, an idea comes out of nowhere, it seems. It is “given.” It simply appears, and from it new creative connections spring.</details>
那时我是警醒的，却又开放而富感受性，悬在“宁静的专注”与“被动”之间的一种奇异的心灵弹性里。在那一刹那，那特定的诗或意念对我而言是全世界独一无二的事。这种极度个人性的投入，与促使这意念“出生”所涉及的工作和游戏，全都使这首诗成为“我的”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I’m alert, yet open and receptive ---- suspended in a strange psychic elasticity between poised attention and passivity. The particular poem or idea is the only thing in the world for me at that point. The highly personal involvement, the work and play involved in helping the idea “out,” all make the poem mine.</details>
这种经验从小即为我所熟知，它是我存在的要素。没有它，或当我没在那种情境里工作时，我就变得无精打采而且忧伤。在我写这序言时，我现在便有点那种同样的发挥个人创造性的感觉，它是“我的”。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This kind of experience has been familiar to me since early childhood. It is the cornerstone of my existence. Without it, or when I am not working generally within that framework, I become listless and sad. To some degree, I have that same sense of personal creativity now, as I write this introduction. It is “mine.”</details>
我与赛斯的书就没有这种关联，对它所涉及的创作过程也毫无知觉。我像在定期课里那样进入出神状态，而赛斯透过我，经过我的口，口述此书。这创造工作与我相距这么远，因此在这方面来说我不能称这作品为我自己的。反之，一部完整的——精彩的——赛斯作品交给了我，为此我自然是极端地感激。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I was not connected in this way with Seth’s book, and had no awareness of the creative processes involved. I went into trance as I do for our regular sessions. Seth dictated the book through me, speaking through my lips. The creative work was so distant from me, that in this respect I could not call the product my own. I am, instead, given a complete product in Seth’s book ---- an excellent one ---- for which I am, of course, exceedingly grateful.</details>
可是，我发现只有我自己的写作才会给我，我所需的那种特别创造性的满足感——有意识地投入于无意识资料，“追捕的兴奋”。并不因为赛斯在做他的事，我就可以免除做我的。如果我不继续自己的工作我会觉得被剥夺了什么。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I’ve found that only my own writing gives me the particular kind of creative satisfaction that I need, however ---- the conscious involvement with unconscious material, the “excitement of the chase.” Because Seth does his thing, I am not absolved from doing mine. I would feel deprived if I did not continue with my own work.</details>
当然，任何人都可以说，在赛斯书里那神秘的过程与我的正常意识离得那么远，以致最后的成品只“看起来”是来自另一个人。我只能说明我自己的感觉，并且强调，赛斯的书，以及赛斯资料的六千页底稿，并没影响到我自己创造性表达的需要或责任。如果两者都来自那同样的无意识，却似并未减缓我工作的效率。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Anyone can say, of course, that in Seth’s book the hidden processes are so separate from my normal consciousness that the final product only seems to come from another personality. I can only state my own feelings and emphasize that Seth’s book, and the whole six-thousand-page manuscript of Seth material, don’t take care of my own creative expression or responsibility. If both came from the same unconscious, it seems that there would be no slack to take up.</details>
纵使如此，我知道赛斯书的制成还是少不了我。他需要我用字遣词的能力；我想，甚至我的性向气质。显然我的写作锻炼有助于转译他的资料，有助于给予它形式，不管这是多么无意识地做到的。我猜想，某些人格上的特征也是很重要的——例如我能敏捷的转换我意识的焦点。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Despite this, I’m aware of the fact that I was necessary to the production of Seth’s book. He needs my ability with words; even, I think, my turn of mind. Certainly my writing training aids in the translation of his material and helps give it form, no matter how unconsciously this is done. Certain personality characteristics are important too, I imagine ---- the agility with which I can switch the focus of my consciousness, for example.</details>
在第四章里赛斯也如此暗示，当他说：“现在，当我写这本书的时候，它的资料到某个程度是经由这位在出神状态的女性之内在感官来指挥的，这是非常有组织的内在精确性(inner precision)与训练的结果。当她全神贯注于物质环境时便不能自我这儿收到资料——它便无法被翻译或诠释。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Seth intimates as much in Chapter Four, when he says, “Now the information in this book is being directed to some extent through the inner senses of the woman who is in trance as I write it. Such endeavor is the result of highly organized inner precision, and of training. [She] could not receive the information from me ---- it could not be translated nor interpreted ---- while she was focused intensely in the physical environment.”</details>
不过，如果只把赛斯书当作是“无意识”产品的一个例子，则它很明白地指出，组织性、辨识力和推理力等品质显然不只为“有意识的心智”所独有，并且它也展示了“内我”的能力和活动的范围。我不相信靠我自己我能得到与赛斯书并驾齐驱的作品。我最多能做到的是，也许在某些诗作或论述里偶尔达到某种高水准，但它们却缺乏赛斯在此自动提供的整体的统一性、连贯性和组织。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Looked at merely as an example of unconscious production, however, Seth’s book clearly shows that organization, discrimination, and reasoning are certainly not qualities of the conscious mind alone, and demonstrates the range and activity of which the inner self is capable. I do not believe that I could get the equivalent of Seth’s book on my own. The best I could do would be to hit certain high points, perhaps in isolated poems or essays, and they would lack the overall unity, continuity, and organization that Seth has here provided automatically.</details>
除此之外，在课中我的某些经验，似乎对我的没能有意识地涉入创作过程有所弥补。例如，我常参与了赛斯的大能量和幽默，享受一种情感上的富足感，并且在一个非常奇特的层面与赛斯接触。我清楚地感觉到他的心情和活力，虽然它们不是对我而发，而是对他当时说话的对象。当它们流过我时我感觉得到。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Besides this, I have certain unique experiences during sessions that seem to compensate for my lack of conscious creative involvement. Often I participate in Seth’s great energy and humor, for example, enjoying a sense of emotional richness and encountering Seth’s personality on a very strange level. I feel his mood and vitality clearly, though they are not directed at me, but to whomever Seth is addressing at the moment. I feel them as they pass through me.</details>
如罗的注所显示的，在替赛斯说话时我也常有别种的经验。举例来说，有时我看见内在的意象(visions)。这些可能把赛斯正在说的话以画面表明出来，因此我在以两种方式接收资料；或者它们也可能与稿子完全无关。在课中我也有过几次“出体”(out-of-body)的经验，那时我看见实际上发生在几千里外的事。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>As Rob’s notes show, I often have other kinds of experiences, also, while speaking for Seth. Sometimes, for instance, I see inner visions. These may illustrate what Seth is saying, so that I am receiving information in two ways, or they may be completely separate from the script. I’ve had several “out-of-body” experiences also during sessions, when I saw events actually happening some thousands of miles away.</details>
赛斯用这本书来展示以下这些事实——人类人格是多次元的，我们同时存在于许多实相里，灵魂或内我不是与我们分开的东西，而正是我们存在于其中的那个媒介。他强调“真理”并不是由追随一位老师又一位老师，一个教会到另一个教会，一种训练到另一种训练而找到的，而是由内看自己来找到。那么对意识的深入知识，“宇宙的奥秘”，都不应该是不让人们知道的秘传真理(esoteric truths)。这种资料对人而言就如空气一样自然，对那些向内源头诚实地寻求的人也是同样可以企及的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This book is Seth’s way of demonstrating that human personality is multidimensional, that we exist in many realities at once, that the soul or inner self is not something apart from us, but the very medium in which we exist. He emphasizes that “truth” is not found by going from teacher to teacher, church to church, or discipline to discipline, but by looking within the self. The intimate knowledge of consciousness, the “secrets of the universe,” are not esoteric truths to be hidden from the people, then. Such information is as natural to man as air, and as available to those who honestly seek it by looking to the source within.</details>
照我的看法，赛斯写了一本在它那类书中的经典之作。在小心地以一个“人物”称他之后，我觉得必须补充说赛斯是个机敏的哲学家和心理学家，对人类人格的种种所知甚深，对人类意识的胜利与困境也了如指掌。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In my opinion, Seth has written a book that is a classic of its kind. After referring to him cautiously as “a personality,” I feel bound to add that Seth is an astute philosopher and psychologist, deeply knowledgeable in the ways of human personality, and well aware of the triumph and plight of human consciousness.</details>
当然，令我个人深感好奇的是，这本书透过我而写出，但我的“意识心”(conscious mind——译注，亦即有意识的心智)并没有时时在关怀地核对、组织与批评，如它在我自己的作品中所做的那样。那时，虽然我的创造和直观能力被予以相当大的自由，意识心仍确然是居控制地位的。可是这本书却又不是“由它自己”写出来的，像某些诗仿佛是自己产生的那样。一个作家有时会说某一本书是“自己写成的”，我了解那是什么意思。然而，在这个例子里，这本书来自一个特定的源头，不只是从“天外”而来，并且它浸染着作者而非我的个人风格。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I’m personally intrigued, of course, that this book was written through me, without my conscious mind there at every point, anxiously checking, organizing, and criticizing, as it does in my own work. Then, while my creative and intuitional abilities are given a good deal of freedom, the conscious mind is definitely in control. Yet this book was not written “by itself,” in the same way that some poems seem to be. Often a writer will say that a certain book “wrote itself,” and I know what that means. In this case, however, the book came from a specific source, not just from “out there,” and it is colored by the author’s personality, which is not mine.</details>
这整个“创造性的冒险”也许是先有“赛斯”这个人物之被创始，而后由他来写书。赛斯也许是个和他的书一样的被造物。如果这样，这是个多次元艺术的绝佳例子，在“无意识”的如此丰富的一个层面造成，以致那“艺术家”对她自己的作品也无所知觉，而与任何外人一样地深感好奇。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The whole creative venture may be the initiation of a personality, Seth, who then writes books. Seth may be as much of a creation as his book is. If so, this is an excellent instance of multidimensional art, done at such a rich level of unconsciousness that the “artist” is unaware of her own work and as much intrigued by it as anyone else.</details>
这是个有趣的假设。事实上，赛斯在他的书中也提及了多次元的艺术。但赛斯还不只是写书而已，他是个发展完全的人格，具有多方面的兴趣：写作、教书、帮助别人。他的幽默感十分具个人色彩而不像我的。他很精明，他的态度是入世而非空灵的。在与人面对面的接触中，他知道如何简明地解释复杂的理论。也许更重要的是，他能把这些概念与日常生活连接起来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This is an interesting hypothesis. In fact, Seth speaks about multidimensional art in his book. But Seth does more than write books. He is a fully developed personality with a variety of interests: writing, teaching, helping others. His sense of humor is quite individualistic and unlike mine. He is shrewd; in his manner more earthy than ethereal. He knows how to explain complex theories simply, in person-to-person contact. Perhaps more important, he is able to relate these ideas to ordinary living.</details>
赛斯也时常出现在我学生的梦里，给予他们有效的指导——教他们运用他们才能的方法或是达成某种目的的方法。几乎我所有的学生也都常有“上课的梦”，在其中赛斯对他们全体说话，就像在正常的课里一样。有好多次当这种“梦中课”正在发生的时候，我醒了过来，而我心中仍听见赛斯的话在萦绕。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Seth also appears frequently in the dreams of my students, giving them instructions that work ---- either involving methods of using their abilities or of achieving certain goals. Almost all of my students have frequent “class dreams,” also, in which Seth addresses them as a group and initiates dream experiments. Sometimes they see him as he appears in the portrait Rob painted of him. On occasion he speaks through my image, as in normal sessions. I have awakened many times, when such dream sessions were taking place, hearing Seth’s words still lingering in my mind.</details>
当然，学生梦见赛斯并不稀奇，也不是说他们只该梦见我。但赛斯确乎已在他们眼中建立了独立的地位，甚至在梦境也变成了教导的工具。换言之，除了制作连续不断的赛斯资料和此书外，赛斯也已进入了许多人的心和意识里。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It’s not unusual that students should dream of Seth, of course, or that they should dream of me. But certainly Seth has achieved independent status in their eyes and has become a vehicle of instruction even in the dream state. In other words, besides producing the continuing Seth material and this book, Seth has entered the minds and consciousness of many people.</details>
不论他的地位如何，一个人在七年内能做到这些，已是很大的成就，何况赛斯是一个没有肉身的人物，那就真的是令人惊愕了。把所有这些活动都归于一个无意识的虚构之物似乎太过分了。(在等量的时间里，我出版了两本书，写完了另一本，并且开始了第四本。我提这个以示赛斯并未吸取任何我自己的创造力。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This is a good deal of accomplishment in seven years for any personality, regardless of its status. For a nonphysical personality, it is astonishing indeed. To ascribe all of this activity to a figment of the unconscious seems rather much. (In the same amount of time I’ve published two books, finished another, and begun a fourth. I mention this to show that Seth hasn’t been absorbing any of my own creativity.)</details>
罗和我并不视赛斯为一个灵(spirit)；我们不喜欢这个名词所暗含的寓意。事实上我们反对的是对幽灵的传统观念，那是延伸自对人类人格的十分局限的概念，只是多少未变地被投射到来世。你可以说赛斯是一个被戏剧化了的“无意识”或一个独立人格。我个人看不出这两者有什么矛盾。赛斯也许是个戏剧化人物，演出一个非常真实的角色——以我们能了解的唯一方式解释他更广大的实相。这是我目前的看法。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Rob and I don’t refer to Seth as a spirit; we dislike the connotations of the term. Actually what we object to is the conventional idea of a spirit, which is an extension of quite limited ideas of human personality, only projected more or less intact into an afterlife. You can say that Seth is a dramatization of the unconscious or an independent personality. Personally, I don’t see why the statements have to be contradictory. Seth may be a dramatization playing a very real role ---- explaining his greater reality in the only terms we can understand. This is my opinion at this time.</details>
首先，对我来说“无意识”(unconsciousness)这名词并不妥，它仅只暗示一个本来开放的心灵系统(open psychic system)，具有统一各种意识交互连接的深根；一个我们全在其中互相连接的网状组织。我们的个人性由它升起，同时也助其形成。这源头包含过去、现在与未来的资料；只有自我(ego)在经验我们所知的时间。我也相信这开放系统包含了我们之外的他种意识。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>First of all, to me the term “unconscious” is a poor one, barely hinting at an actual open psychic system, with deep intertwining roots uniting all kinds of consciousness; a network in which we are all connected. Our individuality rises out of it, but also helps form it. This source contains past, present, and future information; only the ego experiencing time as we know it. I also believe that this open system contains other kinds of consciousness beside our own.</details>
由于我自身的经验，尤其是“出体”状态的经验，使我深信意识是不必依赖物质的。目前有肉身这副模样确乎是“我的”主要存在模式，但我不以此而推断所有的意识必须如此取向。在我看来，只有最盲目的自我主义才敢拿它自己的看法来界定实相，或把它自己的限制和经验投射到其余的存在界上。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Because of my own experiences, particularly with out-of-body states, I’m convinced that consciousness is not dependent upon physical matter. Certainly physical expression is my main mode of existence right now, but I don’t take this to infer that all consciousness must be so oriented. Only the most blind egotism, it seems to me, would dare define reality in its own terms or project its own limitations and experience upon the rest of existence.</details>
我接受如赛斯在此书中所描述的多次元人格的概念，因为我及我学生的经验似乎证实了它。我也认为在那意识的开放系统和无限泉源里，有一个独立的赛斯以与我们相当不同的角度运作。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I accept Seth’s idea of multidimensional personality as described in this book because my experiences, and those of my students seem to confirm it. I also think that in that open system of consciousness and unlimited source, there is an independent Seth who operates in quite different terms than we do.</details>
以何种角度？老实说，我不知道。有一次当我试着为自己、也为ESP班的学生澄清我的概念时，写下了一个简短而直观性的声明，我认为最接近我的看法。罗曾告诉我有关“说法者”(Speakers)的事，赛斯在此书中对他们如此称呼，他们是历代以来不断对人们说法的人，提醒人内在的知识，以使它永不会真的被遗忘。这个意念唤起我的灵感，使我写下这一篇小品。它指出我认为赛斯及其他像他的“人”也许存在于其中的那个架构。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In what terms? Quite honestly, I don’t know. The closest I’ve come to explaining my own views was in a short intuitive statement I wrote for my ESP class, as I tried to clear my ideas for myself and my students as well. Rob had told me about the “Speakers”, as Seth calls them in this book ---- personalities who continually speak to man through the ages, reminding him of inner knowledge so that it is never really forgotten. This evocative idea inspired me to write the small piece which I am including here. It points up the framework in which I think Seth and others like him may exist.</details>
“我们以我们所不了解的方式合成。我们是由元素、化学物质及原子所组成，但我们却开口说话并自取名字。围绕着我们的内在，我们组织了外在物质，凝结成肌肉与骨骼。我们的本体或人格由我们所不知的泉源涌起。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>“We come together in ways that we do not understand. We’re composed of elements, chemicals, and atoms, and yet we speak and call ourselves by name. We organize about our inner stuff the outer stuff that coagulates into flesh and bone. Our identities or personalities spring from sources we do not know.</details>
“也许现在的我们曾一直在那儿等待着，隐藏在创造的可能性中，四散而茫昧的——在十三世纪扫过欧州的雨与风中——在起伏的山峦间——在涌过另一个时地的天空的云朵里。身为尘沙，我们也许曾吹过希腊的门廓。也许我们曾无数次地明灭于有意识与无意识之间，被我们还不太了解的对创造与完美的欲望与渴望所触及。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>“Perhaps what we are has always waited, hidden in the possibilities of creation, dispersed and unknowing ---- in the rain and wind that swept across Europe in the thirteenth century ---- in the heaving mountain ranges ---- in the clouds that rushed through the skies of other times and places. As dust particles, we may have blown past Greek doorways. We may have been sparked on and off into consciousness and unconsciousness a million times, touched by desire, by yearnings toward creativity and perfection we barely understood.</details>
“因而现在可能有其他的‘人’(如赛斯)，也没有形象，但却有知——他们曾是我们现在的样子，但还要更多——他们记着我们已遗忘了的。也许经由意识的加速他们发现了其他的存在形式，或其他我们也为其一部分的实相次元(dimensions of reality)。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>“And so there may be others now (like Seth), also without images, but knowing ---- others who have been what we are and more ---- others who remember what we have forgotten. They may have discovered through some acceleration of consciousness other forms of being, or dimensions of reality of which we are also part.</details>
“因此我们给那些无名者名字，就如我们本也是无名的。我们倾听，但通常我们试图把他们的讯息挤入我们能懂的观念里，给它们穿上陈腐的样版形象。但他们却就在我们周遭，在风里在树梢；有形的和无形的，在许多方面也许比我们还活泼——那些说法者。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>“So we give them names who are nameless, as basically we are nameless. And we listen, but usually we try to squeeze their messages into concepts that we can understand, cloaking them in worn stereotyped images. Yet they are all about us, in the wind and trees, formed and unformed, more alive in many ways perhaps than we are ---- the speakers.</details>
“透过这些声音、这些直觉、这些闪现的灵光与讯息，宇宙向我们说话，向我们每个人说话。对你们说，也对我说。学着聆听你们自己的讯息，不要扭曲你们所听见的，或把它译成陈腔滥调。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>“Through these voices, these intuitions, these flashes of insights and messages, the universe speaks to us, to each of us personally. You are being addressed, and so am I. Learn to hear your own messages, not to distort what you hear or translate it into old alphabets.</details>
“在班上(一般而言，并且在生活中)我认为我们的确在对这种讯息起反应，有时以几近孩童似的智慧把它们演出来，形成原创、个人的戏剧——由我们内在唤起无可名状的意义之戏剧。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>“In class (and in life, generally,) I think we are responding to such messages, sometimes acting them out with almost childlike wisdom, forming them into dramas that are original and individualistic ---- dramas that arouse within us meanings that cannot be put into words.</details>
“这也许是‘神明们’(gods)沉浸其中的那种戏剧，创造自它生成，而向各方面蔓延。我们内心也许在对神明们响应——那内心的了解之火花，超越了我们自己三次元的知识。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>“This may be the kind of play in which the ‘gods’ indulge, from which creations grow, sprawling out in all directions. We may be responding to the gods in ourselves ---- those inner sparks of knowing that defy our own three-dimensional knowledge.</details>
“赛斯也许在引导我们脱出通常的限制，进入本来就属于我们的另一个领域——不论我们在肉体之内或之外它都是基本的。他也许是集合在一起的我们的声音，说道：‘当你们是有意识的身体时，要记得以前和未来，当你们没有身体，作为无羁的能量，没有名字却只有不需舌头的声音，具有不需肉体的创造性时，你们是怎么样的。我们即你们自己，里外翻了个面而已。’”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>“Seth may be leading us out of our usual limitations, into another realm that is ours by right ---- elemental whether we are in flesh or out of it. He may be the voice of our combined selves, saying, ‘While you are conscious bodies, remember what it was like and will be like to be bodiless, to be freewheeling energy without a name but with a voice that does not need tongue, with a creativity that does not need flesh. We are yourselves, turned inside out.’”</details>
然而不管我对赛斯或实相本质的看法如何，这稿本必须独立成书。它具有赛斯这“人”的印记，正如任一本书都自有其作者不可磨灭的烙印，丝毫不爽。在这本书内的观念值得一听，不论其来源，而又正因其来源。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Regardless of my ideas about Seth or the nature of reality, however, this manuscript must stand on its own as a book. It bears the mark of Seth’s personality, as any book carries indelibly within it the stamp of its author, no more and no less. The ideas within it deserve a hearing, despite their source, and conversely, because of it.</details>
当我们的课刚开始时，我想过用我自己的名义出版这本书，好让人因为它的价值而接受它，又不会让人对它的来源起疑。然而，这似乎是不公平的，因为赛斯资料产生的方式不但是它传递的讯息的一部分，而且也强化了讯息本身。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>When our sessions first began, I thought of publishing the material as my own, so that it could be accepted for its value, without introducing questions about its source. This did not seem just, however, because the way the Seth material is produced is part of the message and reinforces it.</details>
我们把赛斯的口述如我们所收到的那样印出来，按照次序，既无增润也无减损。他显然明白口说和写作用字的不同。他在ESP班上的课比较不正式，有相当的相互交流。这本书却更像我们自己的私人课，此书大体是在课里传递的。可以更明确的看出，强调的是内容，更着重文字而非口语性的陈述。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Seth’s dictation is given as we received it, in order, with no paragraphs added or deleted. He certainly knows the difference between spoken and written language. His class sessions are less formal, with a good amount of give and take. This book, though, is much more like our own private sessions in which the body of the material is delivered. The emphasis is more definitely on content, the stress on the written rather than the spoken word.</details>
赛斯的语句结构也没被改变，除了在偶尔的例子(例如少数几次我将一长句变成两个句子)。赛斯也指明了很多标点符号。在这种时候，我们只依照他的指示加上破折号、分号与括号，而把他指示的话语本身略去，以免让读者分心。赛斯也指示我们在某些字句下划线。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Seth’s sentence structure has not been changed either, except in occasional instances. (A few times I made two sentences out of one long one, for example.) Much of the punctuation was indicated by Seth. In such cases, we just inserted the hyphens, semicolons, and parentheses as he suggested, and deleted the directions themselves to avoid distracting the reader. Where Seth asked for quotes, we have used double quotes; otherwise, where the meaning seems to call for them, single quotation marks are used. Seth also instructed us to underline certain words.</details>
赛斯的句子往往很长，特别是就口语演说而言，但他却从不弄乱或与造句法或意义脱节。不论何时，只要在这方面似乎有困难，我们查核原先的课，就会发现是在誊写过程某一处出了错所致。(我特别注意到这点，因为我试过用录音机口述信件，但显然很少成功。在头几句之后，我很难记得我说过了什么，或我是如何地表达的。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Seth’s sentences are often long, particularly for verbal delivery, yet he never gets lost or loses touch with syntax or meaning. Whenever a difficulty seemed to exist in this respect, we checked the original session and saw that somewhere along the line an error in copying had been made. (I noticed this particularly, since I have tried dictating letters into a recorder, with noted lack of success. After the first few sentences, I had great difficulty in remembering what I’d said, or how I expressed it.)</details>
校对主要是修正罗的笔记，当他把它们弄得更像样一点。在有些情形，不属此书的资料也包括了进去，若它们似与正文有关，对本书的表达方法有间接的说明，或对赛斯本身有所洞见。如罗的注记所示，赛斯在书完成后立即口述“附录”。好笑的是，我并不晓得赛斯已经开始了“附录”，倒花了好几天在猜测到底该是谁来管这档子事——而如果是赛斯管，他何时会开始。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Proofreading involved work on Rob’s notes mainly, as he made them more presentable. In some cases, material not a part of the book was included if it seemed relevant, cast sidelights on the method of presentation, or gave insights into Seth himself. As Rob’s notes also show, Seth began dictating the Appendix as soon as the book was finished. Rather amusingly, I didn’t realize that Seth had already begun the Appendix, and I spent several days wondering just who was supposed to take care of it ---- and if Seth was, when he would begin.</details>
这儿再说一件有趣的事：为我自己的书我要写三遍草稿，有时到末了仍不尽满意。此书口述出来却就是它最后的定稿。赛斯也远比我更忠于他订的大纲。不过，他也偶尔离题，正如每个作者应有的权利。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Here is another note of interest along these lines. I write three drafts of my own work, and sometimes still wind up dissatisfied. This book was dictated in its final draft. Seth also followed his outline far more faithfully than I’ve ever followed mine. He also deviated from it in some cases, however, as is every author’s right.</details>
