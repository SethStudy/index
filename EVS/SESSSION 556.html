现在：我们继续口述。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: We will resume dictation.</details>
转世经验是“自己”这个架构的一部分，是活生生的心灵多次元实相之一面。因此，这些经验不只会在梦境，也会在其他的活动层面里反映出来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>reincarnational experiences are a part of the framework of the self, a facet of the multidimensional reality of the living psyche. These experiences will, therefore, be reflected not only in the dream state, but in other layers of activity.</details>
“目前的自己”这块衣料是这些转世的“过去”交织在一起的，而从这些前世，“目前的自己”无意识地由它自己的仓库提取人格的特性、活动与洞见。往往前世记忆浮现到表面却没有被认出来，因为它们以幻想的方式出现，或被投射成艺术的创造。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The fabric of the present self is interwoven with these reincarnational “pasts,” and from them the present self draws unconsciously from its own bank of personality characteristics, activities, and insights. Often Past-life memories come to the surface but are not recognized as such, since they appear in fantasy form, or are projected into art creations.</details>
举例来说，许多写历史故事的作家，是根据他们在那个时代的直接经验来写作的。这种例子代表目前的自己和无意识之间有着合作无间的关系，进而把这些记忆带到了表面，使现在的生活更形丰富。这个人多半变得几乎是有意识地真正觉察到这个情况，而且就在觉察之下，他也知道他真实可靠的资料来源。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Many writers of historical pieces, for example, are writing out of direct experience with those times. Such instances represent an excellent working rapport between the present self and the unconscious, which brings these memories to the surface in such a way that current life is enriched. More often than not, true awareness of the situation often becomes almost conscious, and just beneath awareness the individual knows the source of his authentic material.</details>
在梦中，这转世资料也同样常常被铸入戏剧的模型中。在所有这些之下，女灵与男灵携手合作，再次的，不是彼此对立的而是融合的特性。当然，结合在一起时，它们代表了心灵上也是肉体上的创造之源。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In dreams this reincarnational material is likewise cast into a dramatic mold very frequently. Beneath all this, the anima and the animus work together, again not opposites but blending characteristics. Together, of course, they represent the fount of creativity, psychically as well as physically.</details>
女灵代表了那个必要的最初“内向性质”(inwardness)，深思的、关心的、直观的、转向内的特性，创造力来自其中的向内贯注。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The anima represents the necessary initial “inwardness,” the brooding, caring, intuitive, inside-turning characteristics, the inward focusing from which creativity comes.</details>
“被动”(passive)是对女灵特性的一个很差的形容词，因为它暗示了“缺乏行动”，而事实却远非如此。的确，女灵许可它自己承受别人的行动，但其后的动机是调整自己以与威力极强的其他力量一致的愿望和必要。因此，女灵想被卷走(swept along)的愿望和相对想休息的愿望一样强烈。男灵的特性则供给了攻击性的动力把人格再往外推入肉身活动去，成功掌握因为女灵特性而保有的创造物。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The word “passive” is a poor one to describe the characteristics of the anima, in that it suggests a lack of motion, and this is hardly the case. It is true that the anima allows itself to be acted upon, but the motive behind this is the desire and the necessity to tune into other forces that are supremely powerful. The desire to be swept along, therefore, is as strong with the anima as the opposite desire for rest. The characteristics of the animus provide the aggressive thrust that returns the personality back outward into physical activities, triumphantly holding the products of creativity that the anima characteristics have secured.</details>
“全我”显然是这些特性的总和，还要更多。在最后的转世之后，肉体的、有性别的创造形式就不再必要了。换言之，你不再需要肉体上的生殖。简而言之，“全我”包含了男性与女性的特性，很精细地互相调节、混合，以使“真正的本体”于焉升起——因为当一组特性必须被强调超过另一组时，就如在你目前的人间生活中必须如此的，真正的本体无法升起。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The whole self is obviously the sum of these characteristics, and more. After the final incarnation, the physical, sexual type of creativity is simply no longer needed. You do not need to reproduce physically, in other words. In simple terms the whole self contains male and female characteristics, finely tuned together, blended so that true identity can then arise ---- for it cannot, when one group of characteristics must be emphasized over the other group, as it must be during your present physical existence.</details>
(9:30)为什么在你们的次元里采用了这种分离是有许多理由的。这些理由与人类选择如何去演化和运用能力的特定方式有关；对此点我将再加说明，但它不属于此章。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:30.) There are many reasons why the separation has been adopted within your dimension. The reasons have to do with the particular way in which mankind has chosen to evolve and use his abilities; and I will have more to say regarding this point, but it does not belong in this chapter.</details>
男人的女灵或隐藏的女性自身，投射到〔他的〕人际关系上是十分自然的，容许他不止对那些关系更了解，并且能与他自己做为其他女性的人生相关联。女人投射其男灵在男的亲人与朋友身上也是一样的。女灵与男灵的真相比荣格所假设的要深奥得多。象征地说，两者会合起来代表了具有多种能力、欲望与特性的全我。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The projection of the man’s anima, or hidden female self, upon [his] relations is quite natural, and allows him not only to understand them better but to relate with the other female existences of his own. The same is true of the woman’s projection of the animus upon male relatives and friends. The reality of the anima and the animus is far deeper then than Jung supposed. Symbolically speaking, the two together represent the whole self with its diverse abilities, desires, and characteristics.</details>
它们一起充作一个与生俱有的、无意识的稳定因素，不但在个人上，并且在文化上运作于你们文明的面貌之后。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Together they act as a built-in, unconscious stabilizing factor, operating behind the faces of your civilization not only individually but culturally.</details>
如你所知到的“人格”无法被了解，除非把女灵与男灵的真正意义纳入考虑。一般说来，转世的模式是开放的，即在其内还有种种变化的余地。每个全我有它自己的个人特性。在指导大纲之内，它可以按它认为合适的方式选择每一世的生活。可能有一连串没有打断的男性或女性人生。这样的选择有些缺点。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Personality as you know it, cannot be understood unless the true meaning of the anima and the animus is taken into consideration. The reincarnational pattern is generally speaking an open one, in that within it there is room for diversity. Each whole self has its own individual characteristics. It can live its lives as it sees fit within the guidelines. There may be a series of male or female existences, unbroken. Such a choice has some drawbacks.</details>
不过，并没有法则来强制在不同转世里的性别发展，除了你必须接受两种性别的经验，并且发展种种不同的特性。这并不是说你必须经历同样数目的男性或女性人生。举例来说，有些人发现做为某一性比另一性容易发展得多，他需要在他感到困难的那个性别上有更多体验的机会。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There are, however, no rules dictating the sexual development in varying incarnations, except that experience with both sexes must be taken on, and the various characteristics developed. This does not mean that an equal number of male and female lives must be lived. Some, for example, find it far easier to develop as one sex or the other, and will need more opportunities for experience as the sex with which they experience difficulty.</details>
当选择了一连串单一性别(one-sex)的人生时，男灵与女灵在这种例子里就变得更重要了。男灵与女灵的原始模式来自尚未开始转世的全我。男灵与女灵随着个人第一次的肉身生活一同诞生，而作为一个内在的模式，来提醒这人格它基本的统一性。这就是为什么在这些象征后有强烈的心灵能量，以及他们能转移与投射这种如神般的特质的另外一个理由。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The animus and the anima become even more important in these instances when a series of one-sex lives are chosen. The original pattern for the animus and anima comes from the whole self before reincarnations. The animus and the anima are born into the individual with the first physical life, and serve as an inner pattern, reminding the personality of its basic unity. Here is another reason for the strong psychic charge behind these symbols and the godlike quality that they can transmit and project.</details>
(9:48)男人渴求女灵，因为对深处的无意识而言，它代表了那些全我的其他特性，一方面潜隐不显，一方面又挣扎着想要获释。这两者之间的张力，使得他以创造性来缓和攻击性，或创造性地利用攻击性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:48.) The male yearns toward the anima because it represents to the deep unconscious those other characteristics of the whole self that, on the one hand, lie latent, and that, on the other hand, struggle for release. The tension between the two leads him to temper aggressiveness with creativity, or to use aggressiveness creatively.</details>
其实，在这些象征与人类所卷入的奋斗之间有很深的关系。如你所知你的意识，你们目前特定的这种意识，是由一种特别的张力，一种由全我的真正无意识里升起的特定焦点，所带来“知觉”的一个声明。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now there are deep correlations between these symbols and the struggle in which mankind is involved. Your consciousness as you know it, your particular present kind of consciousness, is a statement of awareness brought about by a particular kind of tension, a specific kind of focus arising from the true unconscious of the whole self.</details>
(珍，身为赛斯，自九点八分课开始后讲到现在没有休息过，现在是9:54。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane, speaking as Seth, hadn’t taken a break since the session began at 9:08. It was now 9:54.)</details>
我知道你累了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I know you are tired.</details>
(“我没事。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“I’m okay.”)</details>
真正的无意识并非无意识。相反的，它是如此极深的、无法形容的有意识，以致它洋溢出来。你所知的生活仅只是它在其中有意识的许多区域之一。在它所意识到的每一面，真的必须维持极大的力量与平衡，以使这特定的意识——经验与所有其他的分开。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The true unconscious is not unconscious. Instead, it is so profoundly and unutteringly conscious that it bubbles over. The life that you know is simply one of the many areas in which it is conscious. In each facet of its consciousness, literally tremendous power and balance must be maintained to hold aloft this particular consciousness-experience from all others.</details>
(9:58)你们的实相存在于一个特殊的活动区域，在其中攻击性的品质、向外冲刺的特性是绝对必要的，以防止你落回到你最近才由其中冒出头来的无限可能性里。但由这无意识的“可能性之温床”，你得到你的力量、你的创造力，以及你自己那种既脆弱又有力的个人意识。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:58.) Your reality exists in a particular area of activity in which aggressive qualities, thrusting-outward characteristics, are supremely necessary to prevent a falling back into the infinite possibilities from which you have only lately emerged. Yet from this unconscious bed of possibilities you derive your strength, your creativity, and the fragile yet powerful kind of individual consciousness that is your own.</details>
采用了两性的区分，来分隔与平衡这些最为必要却看起来相反的倾向。只有初级的意识需要这种控制。因此，女灵与男灵深嵌着与它们显然是相反的却必然是相成的倾向，它们在维护你们人类意识的特性上是非常重要的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The two-sex division was adopted, separating and balancing these most necessary but seemingly opposing tendencies. Only beginning consciousness needs these kind of controls. The anima and the animus, therefore, are embedded deeply with their necessary complementary but apparently opposed tendencies, and they are highly important in maintaining the very nature of your human consciousness.</details>
休息一会儿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Rest a moment.</details>
(10:03。仍在出神状态的珍安静地坐了一会儿。我则让手休息一下。在10:04继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:03. Jane, still in trance, sat quietly for a short time. I rested my writing hand. Resume at 10:04.)</details>
那么，在两性之间有一种天然的紧张状态，建基于远比肉体的原因要深得多的原因上。这紧张是来自你意识的天性，意识由女灵升起，但靠着男灵的“攻击性”而得以延续。我曾多少解释了其一对另一的着迷，是由于“全我”内在知识的结果。全我努力奋斗以合一并成全为其一部分看似相反的两种倾向，而获得它真正的本体和身份。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There is also a natural tension, then, between sexes that is based on far deeper causes than physical ones. The tension results from the nature of your consciousness that arises from the anima, but depends for its continuation upon the “aggressiveness” of the animus. I have to some extent explained the fascination that one has for the other, as resulting from the inner knowledge of the whole self, that strives to attain true identity as it struggles to combine and fulfill the seemingly opposite tendencies that are a part of it.</details>
在转世轮回结束时，全我远比以前发展得多得多了。它在先前所不知的实相次元中体认、经验它自己，而在如此做时，自然增益了它的存在。那么，这并不只是全我分裂为二、然后就又回到它自己的这样一件事。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>At the end of the reincarnational cycle, the whole self is far more developed than it was before. It has realized and experienced itself in a dimension of reality unknown to it earlier, and in doing so, has of course increased its being. It is not a matter, then, of a whole self splitting in half, and then simply returning to itself.</details>
(在10:12长长的停顿。)有许多关乎受孕的事应该在此处讨论一下。不过，这里又有活动的余裕和许多的变奏。通常在两世之间，你事先选择了你的孩子，而他们也选择你为父母。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Long pause at 10:12.) Now there are many matter concerning the nature of conception that should be discussed here. Again, however, there is leeway and many variations. Usually between lives you choose ahead of time your children, and they choose you as parents.</details>
(10:15)如果你将生为一个男人，那么你的母亲就成了启动你内在女灵象征的一个刺激，使你自己以前女性生涯的模式变为你这一生的一部分。如果你在过去已认识她，你的母亲在生你时会涌现一连串的梦，关乎你俩在一起的其他人生。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:15.) If you are to be born as a male, then the mother serves as a stimulus to activate the symbol of the anima in you, so that the pattern of your own female lives becomes a portion of your next existence. Your mother, if you have known her in the past, will find at your birth an upsurge of dreams involving other existences in which the two of you were together.</details>
这些梦甚至可能没有被她有意识地记录下来，但在很多例子它们是被记下来，然后又被遗忘了。她自己过去的男性生涯会帮助她与做为她儿子的你建立关系。在有些例子里，新的母亲可能觉得非常地具攻击性和紧张。有时这种感觉是由于男性子息启动了在她内的男灵，连带着因此而来的一股富攻击性的感觉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>These may not even be recorded consciously, but in many cases they are, and are then forgotten. Her own past male lives will help her relate to you as her son. In some cases new mothers may feel highly aggressive and nervous. These feelings are sometimes due to the fact that the male son causes an activation of the animus in her, with a resulting charge of aggressive feelings.</details>
你可以休息一下。趁我们做得这么好时，我要把所有那些资料都传过去。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break. I wanted to get all of that through while we were doing so well.</details>
(“我认为它很有意思。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“I think it’s very interesting.”</details>
(10:22。“哇——我真是出去了……我没法睁开眼睛。”珍说，正努力想睁开眼睛。在几次无用的尝试后，她又跌回她的摇椅里。我想她很接近睡眠状态。我叫了她几次，然后当她终于开始看来看去时，我建议她站起来做做运动。她把眼镜戴回去，站起来，开始四处走动。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:22. “Wow ---- am I out… I can’t get my eyes open,” Jane said, trying to do just that. After several futile attempts she slumped back in her rocker. I thought she was close to a sleep state. I called her several times, then suggested she get up and exercise when she finally began to look around. She put her glasses back on, got up, and began to walk about.</details>
(除了在我注明的地方以外，珍的步调一直相当的快。她对资料只有一个模糊的一般性概念。我告诉她我认为资料很棒，所有的都棒，特别是最后几页更好。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane’s pace had been quite rapid except where noted. She had but a vague general idea of the material. I told her I thought it was excellent, all of it, with the last few pages even better.</details>
(结果这次休息就成了今晚赛斯资料资料的结束。赛斯然后给了我四页的资料。这儿珍的步调也很好。这一节生产出比平常多得多的资料。它在11:11结束——完成了踏实的一天。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(It turned out that break marked the end of material for Seth’s book tonight. Seth then gave four pages of material for me. Here too Jane’s pace was good. The session produced much more data than usual. It ended at 11:11 P.M. ---- with a good day’s work done.)</details>
