<div style="display:inline">(从3月26到28日，珍在《艾尔默拉星报》的人事栏内登了一则启事，声明她意欲开办一个“创作班”，这是她想做很久的事。因此之故，今天她一直接到电话，而在九点我们坐等赛斯课开始时又接了一个。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Through March 26 to 28, Jane had a notice running under Personals in the Elmira Star Gazette, stating her intention to form a class in creative writing. This is something she’s wanted to do for a long time. Today she has been receiving calls as a result, and took one this evening just as we sat for the session at 9.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(赛斯有所置评，虽然我们并没请他赐教。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Seth had some comments, although we hadn’t asked for them.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">就帮助他人而论，鲁柏在他的ESP课能做得好得多，或再另增一堂ESP课都有用得多。我并不是叫他不要开创作班。他可以随他所喜欢的做。无论如何他都会用到相同的概念，只是方法不同。打电话来问创作班的人只是用它来作个借口而已，他们感到一种向多方面发展的需要。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>As far as helping other people is concerned, [Ruburt] can help far better in his psychic class, or in another additional one. I am not telling him not to have his creative writing class. He can do as he likes. He will be using the same ideas, but different methods, in any case. The people who have called about creative writing are only using that as an excuse. They feel a need of development in many areas.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(够奇怪的，关于写作班的小启招来不少问ESP班的电话。人群为后者而云集令珍很关切，因为在这公寓里已经挤不下了。她告诉我，当她考虑这问题时，她感到“又惊又喜”。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Oddly enough, the notice about the writing class has spurred calls about the ESP class. Jane was concerned about the influx of people for the latter, since she has run out of room in the apartment. She told me the problems made her “nervous but happy” as she considered them.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：请等我们一下。(停顿。)你关于降神会的建议及鲁柏对其他实验的建议——这两者都是好的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Give us a moment. (Pause.) Your suggestions as to the séances and Ruburt’s as to other experiments ---- these ideas are both good ones.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他的定期班不能再扩充了。有实际上的限制。可是，还有其他较不具体的限制，与所涉及的人们的交互反应有关。还有其他你们没想到的可能性。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>His regular classes cannot get larger. There are physical limitations. There are other less tangible limitations, however, having to do with the interactions of the people involved. There are also other possibilities here that you have not thought of.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在9:27停顿很久。)好，请等我们一会儿，我们即将继续口述。待会儿你可以对那资料发问。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Long pause at 9:27.) Now: Give us a moment and we will resume dictation. You may ask questions on that material later.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在此讨论意识的各个不同层面看来，可能与日常的醒时意识离得非常远似的。这其间的分隔是十分武断的。这些种种不同的阶段，全都代表在你自己灵魂内与生俱来的不同属性与方向。即使在你知道的意识里，它们的线索和暗示也会出现影子和倒影。那么，即使正常的醒时意识，对所有其他存在的痕迹既非毫无所知，也不是完全缺乏其他种类的知觉。只因你通常以有限的方式用你的醒时意识，以致你不是经常地接触到这些线索。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The various levels of consciousness discussed here may appear to be very divorced from ordinary waking ones. The divisions are quite arbitrary. These various stages all represent different attributes and directions inherent within your own soul; clues and hints of them, shadows and reflections appear even in the consciousness that you know. Even normal waking consciousness, then, is not innocent of all other traces of existence, or devoid of other kinds of awareness. It is only because you usually use your waking consciousness in limited ways that you do not encounter these clues with any regularity.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">它们永远在场。你跟随它们的话，就能给你对那些其他方向及我们曾说过的其他层面有一点概念。例如，常常看似不相关联的象征或影像会出现在你心中。通常你会忽略它们。如果你反过来接受并把注意力转向它们，你们就能跟着它们到几个其他的层面，比如说，至少很容易到达“A—1”与“A—2”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They are always present. Following them can give you some idea of those other directions, and those other levels of which we have spoken. Often, for example, seemingly unrelated symbols or images may rise into your mind. Usually you ignore them. If instead you acknowledge them and turn your attention to them, you can follow them to several other layers, at least, for example, A-l and A-2, with ease.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:35)在你如此做时，那象征或影像可能会变，好比说，因而你看不到在最初的印象与下一个之间有多少相似处。可是，它们之间也许有非常重要的直觉上、联想上与创造上的联系。通常事后回想一下，会让你看到为何一个影像会溶入另一个中。一个单一的影像可能突然开放成一幅全然抽象的风景，但如你不承认刚刚位于现在知觉之下那些最初的线索，你对这些就都不会知道了。只要你愿意去看，就可看到那些最初的线索几乎是透明的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:35.) The symbols or images may change as you do so, so that you perceive little similarity between, say, the initial image and the next one. The connection may be highly intuitional, however, associative, and creative. Often a few moments’ reflection afterward will allow you to see why the one image merged into the other. A single image may suddenly open up into an entiremental landscape, but you will know none of this if you do not acknowledge the first clues that are just beneath present awareness, and almost transparent if you are only willing to look.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">交替的焦点只是一种状态，在其中，你将你的意识转向其他非习惯性的方向，以便感知十分真实的、与你自己实相同时存在的实相。你必须改变你的知觉去感知任何实际上不是为了物质形式而设的实相。这多少像是由你的眼角或心角“余光”看出去而非向前直看。(停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Alternate focusis merely a state in which you turn your consciousness in other than its habitual direction, in order to perceive quite legitimate realities that exist simultaneously with your own. You must alter your perception to perceive any reality that is not geared practically toward material form. This is something like looking out of the corner of your eye or mind, rather than straight ahead. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">使用交替的焦点，经过练习以后，你可能感知在任一指定空间中已填满，或以你的话说将填满它的不同物质组成物。在某些梦境你可能探访一个特定的地点，而后感知这地点，好比说在三个世纪以前与五年以后的样子，却从未明白那个梦的意思。对你而言，似乎空间在某一刻只能被一个特定项目填满，而那一个必须挪开来才能让位给另一个。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Using alternate focus, with practice it is possible to perceive the different physical formations that have filled any given area of space, or that will fill it in your terms. In some dream states you may visit a particular location and then perceive the location as it was, say, three centuries ago and five years hence, and never understand what the dream meant. It seems to you that space can be filled only by a given item at a time, that one must be removed to make room for another.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">其实你只是以这种方式感知而已。当你用“交替的焦点”的时候，你就可以摒弃那些通常会防守、指挥和控制感知的基本假设，你可以自你所知的这一刻走开，又回到它而发现它还在那儿。意识只是假装屈从于时间的概念，在其他层面它喜欢与这种观念游戏，而由发生于时间范畴之外的事件上感知到伟大的统一性——例如，它可以混合来自不同世纪的事件，把历史和私人的环境摘出时间架构之外，然后借由检查它们而找出和谐与接触点。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Instead you only perceive in this fashion. In Alternate focusyou can dispense with the root assumptions that usually guard, direct, and limit your perception. You are able to step aside from the moment as you know it, and return to it and find it there. Consciousness only pretends to bow to the idea of time. At other levels it enjoys playing with such concepts and perceiving great unity from events that occur outside of a time context ---- mixing, for example, events from various centuries, finding harmony and points of contact by examining both historical and private environments, plucking them out of the time framework.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">其实，你在睡眠时甚至也这样做。如果你没在醒时这样做，那是因为你把你的意识控制得太紧了。现在你可以休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Again, you even do this in your sleep. If you do not do it in the waking state, it is because you have held your consciousness in too tight a rein. Now you may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:48。步调很快。在10:05恢复。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:48. The pace had been fast. Resume at 10:05.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：如我在此书里稍早曾提到过的，虽则你的“正常醒时意识”对你似乎是连续的，而你通常并没觉察到“空白点”，无论如何它却有很多的波动。到一个很大的程度，它只对自己及其感知有所记忆。于是，在正常的意识里，似乎好像没有真正其他类的自己，也没有其他的区域或层面。当它碰到“空白点”而“回来”时，它挡掉了曾发生过“不作用的时候”(nonfunction)的觉察。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: As mentioned somewhat earlier in this book, while your normal waking consciousness seems continual to you, and you are aware usually of no blank spots, nevertheless it has great fluctuations. To a large extent it has memory only of itself and its own perceptions. In normal consciousness, then, it seems as if there are no real other kinds of consciousness, no other areas or levels. When it encounters “blank spots” and “returns,” it blots out awareness that the moment of nonfunction occurred.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">它忘掉了那个“踉跄”。在它作为它自己时，它无法觉察另外不同种类的意识，除非用什么方法使它从这“健忘症”中恢复。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It forgets the stumble. It cannot be aware of alternate kinds of consciousness while being itself, unless methods are taken that allow it to recover from this amnesia.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:13。在课前我们忘了把我们的猫——威立——放到另一个房间，现在它跳进珍的怀里，因此我必须把我的笔记簿放下。当我抱它回画室时，它打着呼噜，珍在出神状态中耐心地等。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:13. We had forgotten to put our cat, Willy, in another room before the session. Now he jumped into Jane’s lap, so I had to lay my notebook aside. He purred as I carried him back to the studio. Jane sat waiting patiently in trance.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">它在实相里跳进跳出。有时它走了，你却没觉察到。在这种场合你的注意力集中于别处，在你可称为“微梦”或“幻相”的境界里，或在相当超过正常焦点之外的思想联想和直觉的过程里。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It plays hopscotch in and out of reality. It is gone sometimes and you are not aware of it. On such occasions your attention is focused elsewhere, in what you might call mini-dreams or hallucinations, or associative and intuitive processes of thought that go quite beyond normal focus.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在这空隙里，你的确以非正常醒时的意识感知到其他类的实相。当你回来时，却断了那根线。正常醒时意识假装从来没有任何间断。这种情形相当有规律地发生，只是程度不一，而按照你的活动，由每小时十五次到五十次不等。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In these lapses you are perceiving other kinds of reality ---- with other than normal waking consciousness. When you return, you lose the thread. Normal waking consciousness pretends there was never any break. This happens with some regularity, and to varying degrees, from fifteen to fifty times an hour, according to your activities.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在种种不同的时候，许多人的确逮到了他们自己，因为那经验是如此生动，以致它跃过了那空隙，可以说，那时候感受是如此强烈，甚至令正常醒时意识也觉察到它。这些偶尔发生的经验对肉体的意识是相当必要的。它们被如此巧妙又细密地织入了你的觉察之网，以致为你的心灵与感觉氛围渲染了色彩。(停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>At various times many people do catch themselves, the experience being so vivid that it leaps the gap, so to speak, with perception so intense that even normal waking consciousness is made aware of it. These intervals are quite necessary to physical consciousness. They are woven through the fabric of your awareness so cleverly and so intimately that they color your psychic and feeling atmosphere. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">正常醒时意识织出织入于这广大无垠的支持网。你的内在体验是如此复杂，几乎无法以言语形容。正常的醒时意识，虽然它自身有记忆，显然并不是所有时候都保有了所有的记忆。有人说过去事件的记忆掉回潜意识里。它并没有过去，而是非常活的，我说“活的”是指生活着而且活动着，虽然你不集中焦点于其上。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Normal waking consciousness weaves in and out of this infinite supportive webwork. Your inner experience is so intricate that verbally it is almost impossible to describe. Normal waking consciousness, while having memory of itself, obviously does not retain all memory all of the time. It is said that memory of past events drops back into the subconscious. It is still intensely alive, and by alive I mean living and active, although you do not focus upon it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你人格的内在部分对你所有的梦也都有记忆，这些全同时存在，可以说悬挂着，像高悬在一个黑暗城市上的灯，照亮心灵的各个部分。这些记忆系统全都互相连接、交相辉映。其实以同样方式，你对往世生活的记忆也都相当完整，全都在整个的记忆系统里作用。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Inner portions of your personality also have memory of all of your dreams. These exist simultaneously, and suspended, so to speak, like lights over a dark city, illuminating various portions of the psyche. These memory systems are all interconnected. Now in the same way you have your memory of past lives, all quite complete and all operating in the entire memory system.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在10:23停顿。)在意识的“空白点”或某种起伏波动的时期，这些记忆系统常被感知。一般而言，带有自己记忆系统的有意识心智不会接受它们。当一个人格了悟到这种其他实相存在，而意识的其他经验是可能的，那时他便发动他自己内在的某些潜能。这些改变使心智内以及脑内的两种电磁连接，甚至改变了感知的机构。它们把能量的库藏合在一起而建立了活动的途径，让有意识的心智对这种资料增加它的敏感度。有意识的心智不再被它自己拘束。它经过了一个相当大的蜕变，负起更大的机能。它将渐次地感知到以前对它关闭的一些内容。不再需要害怕地感知那暂时的“空白点”，作为“不存在”的证据。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 10:23.) In periods of conscious “blank spots” or certain fluctuations, these memory systems are often perceived. As a rule the conscious mind with its own memory system will not accept them. When a personality realizes that such other realities exist and that other experiences with consciousness are possible, then he activates certain potentials within himself. These alter electromagnetic connections both within the mind, the brain, and even the perceptive mechanisms. They bring together reservoirs of energy and set up pathways of activity, allowing the conscious mind to increase its degree of sensitivity to such data. The conscious mind is set free of itself. To a large measure it undergoes a metamorphosis, taking on greater functions. It is able to perceive, little by little, some of the content before closed to it. It need no longer perceive the momentary “blank spots” fearfully, as evidence of nonexistence.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">刚才提到过的意识起伏常是十分微小的，却非常的重要。有意识的心智很明白它自己的起伏状态。一旦它被引导去面对这个时，它并没发现“混乱”，或者是更糟的“不存在”，却是找到它自己能力与力量的泉源。这人格于是开始用它自己的潜能。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The fluctuations mentioned earlier are often quite minute, yet highly significant. The conscious mind knows well of its own fluctuating state. When once it is led to face this, it finds not chaos, or worse, nonexistence, but the source of its own abilities and strength. The personality then begins to use its own potential.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在你可以休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now you may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:35。虽然她的出神状态很深，珍对她话说得较慢有所觉察，她说这是因为赛斯要她一定要用对字。她也有过许多的影像，但现在已说不出来了。她只能说像是“记忆形成的照明系统”等等。我告诉她我认为这资料很丰富且发人深省。在10:47继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:35. Even though her trance had been deep, Jane had been aware of her slower delivery. She said this was because Seth wanted her to use just the right words. She had had many images, also, which she couldn’t verbalize now. She could only say things like “systems of lights for memories,” etc. I told her I thought the material was very rich and evocative. Resume at 10:47.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在幻想的时候与意识在创造的时刻，两者都代表进入这些其他区域的极佳道路。在意识平常富创造性的状态，日常的醒时意识突然为来自这些区域的能量所支持。光是醒时意识不能给你富创意的状态。的确，正常醒时意识对富创意状态可以说跟空白状态一样的惧怕，因为它能感到那个“我”被丢到一旁去了，感到能量的上冲，那是它无法了解的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Periods of reverie and creative moments of consciousness both represent excellent entryways into these other areas. In the usual creative state of consciousness, the regular waking consciousness is suddenly supported by energy from these other areas. Waking consciousness alone does not give you the creative state. Indeed, normal waking consciousness can be as afraid of creative states as it is of blank states, for it can feel that the I is being thrust aside, can feel the upthrust of energy that it may not understand.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">起伏的低点正就是这种经验产生之处，因为正常意识暂时在衰弱状态且正在休息期间。其实，整个肉体机构都经历这种正常的、通常相当被忽略的起伏。这些期间也在起伏，随着与特有的人格有关的节奏而波动。在有些人，这种“波动”比较长而缓慢，其内的山谷是渐渐倾斜的；在另些人则相反。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It is precisely in the low points of fluctuation that such experiences originate, for normal consciousness is momentarily at a weak state and in a period of rest. The whole physical organism undergoes such normal fluctuations, again, that are usually quite unnoticed. These periods also fluctuate, following rhythms that have to do with the characteristic personality. In some the waves of motion are comparatively long and slow, the valleys within being sloped; with others, the reverse is true.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">有些人这种谷底状况较为明显，超乎标准之外。如果那情状没被了解，那么这人可能发觉他不容易与外界事件发生关联。如果他在那状况下能够感知意识的其他区域，他也许会发觉自己在更大的困境——没了解到两个实相系统都是合理的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>With some, the lapses are more noticeable, outside of the norm. If the situation is not understood, then the personality may find it difficult to relate to physical events. If he is able to perceive the other areas of consciousness, he may find himself in still more difficulty ---- not realizing that both systems of reality are valid.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:55)这起伏也有如季节变迁一般的改变。来自意识任一层面的事件全都反映在所有其他的区域里，每一个按照那特定层面的特性而实现出来。就如一个梦，像是丢进梦的意识之池的一粒石子，它的涟漪遍及各个层面，因而任何出现在这池中的行为，也各有它自己的扮相。而交替的焦点容许你感知任一行为的众多表现，感知某一思想的真正多次元实相。它丰富了正常意识。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:55.) The fluctuations also follow seasonal changes. Events from any given layer of consciousness are reflected in all other areas, each being actualized according to the characteristics of the given layer. As one dream is like a stone thrown into the pool of dream consciousness, so any act appears in this pool also in its own guise. Alternate focusallows you to perceive the many manifestations of any given act, the true multidimensional reality of a given thought. It enriches the normal consciousness.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不论你觉察与否，你在这些其他层面都是很活跃的。你不止在实际生活里及梦境里学习，也在这些你对之无记忆的“内在的存在”里学习。特殊性质的创造能力或治疗能力常以这种方式来训练，只在这之后才浮出成为物质世界的确实性。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You are active in these other layers whether or not you are aware of it. You learn not only in physical life and in the dream state, but in these interior existences of which you have no memory. Creative abilities of a specific nature, or healing abilities, are often trained in this fashion, only then emerging into physical actuality.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在这些次元里，你未来的思想与行为就如它们已发生了一样的真实，也一样是你发展的一部分。你不仅是由你的过去，也是由你的未来及交替的存在所形成，这些伟大交互作用是你灵魂架构的一部分。因此，你能改变你由任何其他意识层面所了解的“现在”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your future thoughts and acts are as real in these dimensions as if they had already occurred, and as much a part of your development. You are formed not only by your past but by your future, and by alternate existences. These great interactions are only a part of the framework of your soul. You can, therefore, change present reality as you understand it from any of these other layers of consciousness.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">口述完毕，已很接近本章的结尾了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>End of dictation, and very nearly the end of the chapter.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在11:04停顿。赛斯给了珍一些关于她的写作班与其他事情的个人资料。在11:12结束。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 11:04. Seth then gave some personal material for Jane, dealing with her writing class and other matter. End at 11:12 P.M.)</details><br>
