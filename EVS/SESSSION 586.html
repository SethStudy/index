(这是自5月12日以后的第一节定期课，在这长时间的后面有许多因素：珍对休息的绝对需要、我们想要加以处理却搁置了很久的困难与问题、与其他人一起做的一些事、一次度假，以及又多租了我们公寓走廊对面的几个房间。不过，在这期间珍有时上了ESP班的课，并在那形式内赛斯也给了几课。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(This is the first regular session since May 12. There were many factors behind the long layoff: Jane’s sheer need for rest; problems and questions of our own that we had wanted to deal with, but had put off for a long time; some work with others; a vacation; and the acquisition of several more rooms across the hall from our original apartment. Jane held ESP classes for some of this time, though, and gave a few sessions within that format.</details>
(珍较喜欢赛斯就由他这章中断的地方开始——我确信他有十足的能力做到。她笑道：“但我不在乎他做什么，只要我们上课。”她因为口述的中断多少有些紧张，虽经我的一再保证。虽然她还有大部分没看过，她却极希望看到赛斯完成他的书。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane preferred that Seth simply start in where he had left off on the chapter ---- a feat I was sure he was quite capable of. “But I don’t care what he does,” she laughed, “as long as we have a session.” She was somewhat nervous because of the break in dictation, in spite of my reassurances. She was strongly interested in seeing that Seth finished his book, although she still has to read most of it.</details>
(此节在我们的老卧房里举行，这房间现在清干净后成了我画室的附带部分，我们非常喜欢所获得的多余空间。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(The session was held in our old bedroom, which, having been cleared out now, is an adjunct to my studio. The additional space we’ve acquired is most welcome.)</details>
好，晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Good evening.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
(微笑：)欢迎回来……现在等我一会儿，我们将以重拾我们论宗教的一章来开始。(停顿。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Smiling): And welcome back…. Now give me a moment, and we will begin by resuming our chapter on religion. (Pause.)</details>
善与恶、神与魔、拯救与咒诅的概念，只是更深的宗教价值的象征；如果你愿意，也可谓为宇宙价值(cosmic value)，那是无法被转译为物质人间的说法的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Ideas of good and evil, gods and devils, salvation and damnation, are merely symbols of deeper religious values; cosmic values if you will, that cannot be translated into physical terms.</details>
这些概念变成了我所说过的这些宗教剧极有活力的主题。演员可能一再地“回来”扮演不同的角色。因此，在任一既定的历史性宗教剧里，那些演员可能已经在你们过去的历史场景中出现过，今日的先知即过去戏里的叛徒。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>These ideas become the driving themes of these religious dramas of which I have spoken. The actors may “return,” time and time again, in different roles. In any given historic religious drama, therefore, the actors may have already appeared on the historic scene in your past, the prophet of today being the traitor of the past drama.</details>
可是，这些心灵的存有(psychic entities)是真的。说真的，他们的实相不仅包括了他们自己本体的核心，也还被俗世的观众所投射的思想与情感所加强，而这出戏就是为那些俗世观众而演出的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>These psychic entities are real, however. It is quite true to say that their reality consists not only of the core of their own identity, but also is reinforced by those projected thoughts and feelings of the earthly audience for whom the drama is enacted.</details>
(9:05)心灵或心理上的认同(identification)在此极为重要，而且的确是所有这种戏的核心。在一方面，你可说人与他自己蓄意创造的神明认同。不过，人不了解他自己的发明才智与创造力量的卓越品质。那么，若说神明与人彼此创造，就甚至更接近真理了；但只在你对你的定义很小心时才是如此——因为，到底神明与人的区别何在？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:05.) Psychic or psychological identification is of great import here and is indeed at the heart of all such dramas. In one sense, you can say that man identifies with the gods he has himself created. Man does not understand the magnificent quality of his own inventiveness and creative power, however. Then, say that gods and men create each other, and you come even closer to the truth; but only if you are very careful in your definitions ---- for how, exactly, do gods and men differ?</details>
神明的属性是人自己内在天生就有的那些，被放大而变成了强有力的活动。人相信神永生不死。人也永生不死，但他们已忘了这点，就只记得把这特性赋予他们的神明。那么，显然地，超乎这些俗世历史的宗教剧——那似乎一再重现的神明与人的故事——之外，还有灵性的实相(spiritual reality)存在。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The attributes of the gods are those inherent within man himself, magnified, brought into powerful activity. Men believe that the gods live forever. Men live forever, but having forgotten this, they remember only to endow their gods with this characteristic. Obviously, then, beyond these earthly historic religious dramas, the seemingly recurring tales of gods and men, there are spiritual realities.</details>
(9:10)剧中演员的背后，还有更有力量的“存有”，他们已颇超越了“角色扮演”这回事。那么，这些戏本身，那横扫过世世代代的各种宗教——其实只是影子，虽然是对人有帮助的影子。在善与恶的架构之后，是一个深远得多的精神价值。因此，当所有的宗教在试图抓住“真理”时，必会有相当大的程度害怕它会永远逃过它们。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:10.) Behind the actors in the dramas, there are more powerful entities who are quite beyond role-playing. The plays themselves, then, the religions that sweep across the ages ---- these are merely shadows, though helpful ones. Behind the frame of good and evil is a far deeper spiritual value. All religions, therefore, while trying to catch “truth” must to some large degree fear its ever eluding them.</details>
只有“内我”在休息时、在冥思中，可偶尔看到一眼这些无法具体表达的内在实相的一部分。这些价值、直觉或洞见是按照每个人的了解程度给他的，因此关于它们的故事常会有所不同。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The inner self alone, at rest, in meditation, can at times glimpse portions of these inner realities that cannot be physically expressed. These values, intuitions, or insights are given each to each according to his understanding, and so the stories told about them will often vary.</details>
例如，在一个宗教历史剧里的主角，意识层面上也许明白或不明白这种资讯是怎么给他的。但是也许在他看来他的确知道，因为一项教条的来源，其意义会以这主角所能了解的说法解释给他听。历史上的耶稣知道祂是谁，但祂也知道祂是组成一个“存有”的三个人格之一。到一个很大的程度，祂也分享其他二人的记忆。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>For example, the main character in a religious historical drama may or may not consciously be aware of the ways in which such information is given to him. And yet it may seem to him that he does know, for the nature of a dogma’s origin will be explained in terms that this main character can understand. The historical Jesus knew who he was, but he also knew that he was one of three personalities composing one entity. To a large extent he shared in the memory of the other two.</details>
我提过许多次的第三个人格，在你们来说还未出现，虽然他的存在曾被预言为“基督再临”(Second Coming——马太福音第二十四节)。这些预言是以那个时代的通行文化而言的，因此，虽然这预言已把舞台准备好了，但他造成的曲解很可叹，因为这基督不会像预言一直在说的，在你们世界末日时来到。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The third personality, mentioned many times by me, has not in your terms yet appeared, although his existence has been prophesied as the “Second Coming” (Matthew 24). Now these prophecies were given in terms of the current culture at that time, and therefore, while the stage has been set, the distortions are deplorable, for this Christ will not come at the end of your world as the prophecies have been maintaining.</details>
(9:20)。祂不会来奖赏正直的义人，而把作恶者扔到永远的地狱里去。不过，祂会开始一个新的宗教戏剧，维持住某些历史的连续性。可是，就如以前那一次一样，“祂是谁”不会被普遍地知道，不会有全世界都信服的光荣宣告。在祂来临时，基督教将是一团糟，祂将回来重整基督教，并建立一个新的思想体系，当世界迫切地需要一个的时候。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:20.) He will not come to reward the righteous and send evildoers to eternal doom. He will, however, begin a new religious drama. A certain historical continuity will be maintained. As happened once before, however, he will not be generally known for who he is. There will be no glorious proclamation to which the whole world will bow. He will return to straighten out Christianity, which will be in a shambles at the time of his arrival, and to set up a new system of thought when the world is sorely in need of one.</details>
(9:25)。到那时，所有的宗教都将在严重的危机里。祂将颠覆宗教的组织——而非统合它们。祂的讯息将是关于个人与“一切万有”的关系。祂将清楚地说出一些方法，使得每个个人与他自己的“存有”能达到一个亲密接触状态；“存有”在某个程度是人与“一切万有”的中间人。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:25.) By that time, all religions will be in severe crisis. He will undermine religious organizations ---- not unite them. His message will be that of the individual in relation to All That Is. He will clearly state methods by which each individual can attain a state of intimate contact with his own entity; the entity to some extent being man’s mediator with All That Is.</details>
到公元2075年，所有这些都已完成。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>By 2075, all of this will be already accomplished.</details>
你在此可作个注，预言家诺查丹玛斯(Nostradamus)把罗马天主教会的解散看作世界末日。他不能想象没有它还有文明，因而在看他后来的许多预言时，你们心里应有这个准备。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may make a note here that Nostradamus saw the dissolution of the Roman Catholic Church as the end of the world. He could not imagine civilization without it, hence many of his later predictions should be read with this in mind.</details>
基督的第三人格的确会以一位伟大的通灵者著称，因为就是祂将要教导人类来用他们的内在感官，唯独内在感官使得真正的灵性(spirituality)成为可能。当转世的记忆浮升到意识的表面时，杀人者与受害者将互换角色。经由发展这些能力，人们将会对“所有生命的神圣性”有切身的认识与珍视。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The third personality of Christ will indeed be known as a great psychic, for it is he who will teach humanity to use those inner senses that alone make true spirituality possible. Slayers and victims will change roles as reincarnational memories rise to the surface of consciousness. Through the development of these abilities, the sacredness of all life will be intimately recognized and appreciated.</details>
有几个在那个时代之前诞生的人，会以不同的方式重新唤起人们的期望。有一个这样的人已经生在印度靠近加尔各答的一个小省份里，但终其一生，他的传教活动似乎都保持为比较地方性的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now there will be several born before that time who in various ways will rearouse man’s expectations. One such man has already been born in India, in a small province near Calcutta, but his ministry will seem to remain comparatively local for his lifetime.</details>
另一位将生在非洲，一个黑人，他的主要工作将在印尼完成。以你们的话来说，期望早已设立，而将会被新的先知所加强，直到基督的第三个人格真的出现。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Another will be born in Africa, a black man whose main work will be done in Indonesia. The expectations were set long ago in your terms, and will be fed by new prophets until the third personality of Christ does indeed emerge.</details>
祂将把人们领到这么多世纪以来宗教所依赖的象征背后去探究其真意。神将强调个人的灵性经验、灵魂的开展性，而教人们认识他自己实相的多次元面貌。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>He will lead man behind the symbolism upon which religion has relied for so many centuries. He will emphasize individual spiritual experience, the expansiveness of soul, and teach man to recognize the multitudinous aspects of his own reality.</details>
现在你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take your break.</details>
(“谢谢。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Thank you.”</details>
(9:37。赛斯幽默地谈到休息，因为步调大半都很快，少有停顿。珍的出神状态很好。我必须比平常更辛苦地作笔录，因为我久未练习；我同时发现，我一时已忘了一些我自己速记方法所用的符号。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:37. Seth spoke humorously about break, since the pace had been mostly fast, with few pauses. Jane’s trance had been good. I had to work harder than usual taking notes because I was out of practice; I also discovered I’d temporarily forgotten some of the symbols I use in my own version of Speedwriting.</details>
(在休息时，珍读了一下《灵界的讯息》第十八章的一部分——原本来自1969年7月2日的第491节——然后宣称她认为那里谈到的三位基督及今晚赛斯所给的资讯有个矛盾。此地是有问题的那段，从“神的观念”那章的第316至317页：<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(During the break Jane read over parts of Chapter Eighteen of The Seth Material, then announced that she thought there was a contradiction, between that material ---- originally from the 491st session on July 2, 1969 ---- on the three Christs, and the information given by Seth this evening. Here are the paragraphs in question from pages 246?47 of the chapter on “The God Concept”:</details>
(“从前有三个人，他们的人生在历史上变得混淆起来而被混在一起了，他们‘组合起来的历史’被认作是基督的一生……他们每一个在心灵方面都有极高的禀赋，都知道各自的角色，并且甘愿接受它。这三个人是一个‘存有’的一部分，在同一个时代获得了‘人身’。不过他们却不是生在同一天。这‘存有’为何没以一个人的身份回来是有理由的。其一，一个存有的全部意识，对一个肉体的载具来说是太过强烈了。其二，这存有想要一个更多样化的环境，而且唯有如此，才可能有这样的环境。”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“There were three men whose lives became confused in history and merged, and whose composite history became known as the life of Christ…. Each was highly gifted psychically, knew of his role, and accepted it willingly. The three men were a part of one entity, gaining physical existence in one time. They were not born on the same date, however. There are reasons why the entity did not return as one person. For one thing, the full consciousness of an entity would be too strong for one physical vehicle. For another, the entity wanted a more diversified environment than could otherwise be provided.</details>
(“这存有一度生为施洗约翰，而后他又以另两种身份降生。其中之一涵括了大多数有关基督的故事所论及的那个人格……以后我再告诉你关于那另一位。在这一个存有的三部分之间经常有沟通，虽然他们生死异时。人类由它自己的心灵库藏中，从可资应用的、已个人化的意识联合库藏中征召这些人格。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“The entity was born once as John the Baptist, and then he was born in two other forms. One of these contained the personality that most stories of Christ refer to…. I will tell you about the other personality at a later time. There was constant communication between these three portions of one entity, though they were born and buried at different dates. The race called up these personalities from its own psychic bank, from the pool of individualized consciousness that was available to it.”</details>
(我也开始觉得奇怪。我们一直以为造成基督存有的三个人格已经活过又死了，但现在赛斯却在谈到关于第三人格在下一世纪回来的事。该怎么解释呢？我们并不懊恼，但是我们的确感到不安，当课在9:57继续时。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(I too had begun wondering. All along we’d been thinking the three personalities making up the Christ entity had already lived and died, but now here Seth was talking about the third personality returning in the next century. What was the explanation? We weren’t upset; yet we did feel uneasy as the session resumed at 9:57.)</details>
现在：我们继续吧。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Let us resume.</details>
在历史上的第三位人物，在你们说来已诞生了，而且是整个基督人格的一部分，自己承担起一个“狂热分子”的角色。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The third historical personage, already born in your terms, and a portion of the entire Christ personality, took upon himself the role of a zealot.</details>
这人有卓越的能量、力量与伟大的组织能力，但是他的无心之过，使得一些危险的曲解永存下去。对那个历史时期的记录是分散而互相矛盾的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This person had superior energy and power and great organizing abilities, but it was the errors that he made unwittingly that perpetuated some dangerous distortions. The records of that historical period are scattered and contradictory.</details>
那么就历史上而言，这人是保罗(Paul)或扫罗(Saul)。他的责任是来建立一个架构。但它应是一个意念上的架构，而非法规上的架构；是人的架构，而非团体的架构。在此处他跌倒了，而将来他将以刚才提及的第三位人格身份回来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The man, historically now, was Paul or Saul. It was given to him to set up a framework. But it was to be a framework of ideas, not of regulations; of men, not of groups. Here he fell down, and he will return as the third personality, just mentioned, in your future.</details>
不过，照那方面来说，并没有四个人格。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In that respect, however, there are not four personalities.</details>
(“我懂了。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“I understand.”)</details>
那么，扫罗费了很大的劲把他自己建立成一个分开的本体。好比说，他的特性好像和历史上的基督有相当的不同。他是在一个强烈的个人经验中“皈依”的(converted)——这件事是为了要使他着重个人的角度，而非组织性的角度。但他早年生活里——不是作为一个青年时，而是更早时——的一些功绩被归给了基督。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now Saul went to great lengths to set himself as a separate identity. His characteristics, for example, were seemingly quite different from those of the historical Christ. He was “converted” in an intense personal experience ---- a fact that was meant to impress upon him the personal and not organizational aspects. Yet some exploits of his in his earlier life have been attributed to Christ ---- not as a young man, but earlier.</details>
(10:05)所有的人格都有自由意志，并且也自行解决他们自己的挑战。扫罗也不例外。不过，如我们现在对事件的了解来看，这种在组织方面的“扭曲”，在历史的架构里也是必要的。因此，在另一个层面，扫罗的倾向是被了解的，它们也有其用处。不过，也就是为了这个理由他将再度出现，这一次是来毁掉那些扭曲。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:05.) All personalities have free will and work out their own challenges. The same applied to Saul. The organizational “distortions,” however, were also necessary within the framework of history as events are understood. Saul’s tendencies were known, therefore, at another level. They served a purpose. It is for this reason, however, that he will emerge once again, this time to destroy those distortions.</details>
其实他自己并没创造这些扭曲，再把它们推到历史的实相上。(珍停下来，一只手举到她眼上。)他根据他发现自己被迫承认的某些事实而创造了它们：在当时的那个世界里，若想把基督教的概念，与无数的其他学说和宗教划清界限，若想在互相敌对的派别中间维持住它，则必须要有俗世的权力。他的工作就是要形成一个有形的架构；而甚至在当时，他也很害怕这个架构会把概念扼杀，但别无他法。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now he did not create them on his own, and thrust them upon historical reality. (Jane paused, a hand to her eyes.) He created them in so far as he found himself forced to admit certain facts: In that world at that time, earthly power was needed to hold Christian ideas apart from numberless other theories and religions, to maintain them in the middle of warring f actions. It was his job to form a physical framework; and even then he was afraid that the framework would strangle the ideas, but he saw no other way.</details>
(“为什么有保罗与扫罗两个名字？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Why the two names, Paul and Saul?”)</details>
人们叫他这两个名字。(停顿。)可是，当第三个人格在历史上重现，他不会被称为老保罗，却将在祂之内带着所有那三个人格的特性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>He was called both. (Pause.) When the third personality reemerges historically, however, he will not be called the old Paul, but will carry within him the characteristics of all the three personalities.</details>
(珍又停下。“我能问一个很蠢的问题吗？”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane paused again. “Can I ask a very stupid question?”)</details>
可以。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may.</details>
(随后赛斯和我有一段短短的交谈，因为说得太快没记录下来。我很想知道这基督存有的三个人格是否以人身相会以及相会的时间。看起来在他们之间应有卓越的心灵交动，而我想对这个多知道一些。珍作为赛斯，礼貌地倾听我这些打破沙锅问到底的问题。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(There followed a short exchange between Seth and me, which isn’t recorded verbatim because it was too rapid. I was interested in learning whether, and when, the three personalities of the Christ entity had met as physical beings. It seemed that superior psychic interactions would have taken place among them, and I wanted to know more about this. Jane, as Seth, listened politely to my groping questions.)</details>
很容易看出你对圣经一无所知——<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is easy to see that you have no knowledge of the Bible ?</details>
(“真的。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“True.”)</details>
——因为对那些熟知圣经的人，这会是相当明显的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>? for this would be fairly apparent to those who have.</details>
保罗试图否认知道他自己是谁这回事，直到他的“皈依”经验之后，以寓言的说法，他代表了“自己”天人交战的一部分，这部分与他自己的“知识”作对，并且是极为专注于俗世生活的。他仿佛从一个极端走到另一个极端，先反对基督然后又赞同祂。但这内在的“激烈”总是在的，这内心的烈火以及他试着去隐藏了那么久的对事实的认知。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Paul tried to deny knowing who he was, until his experience with conversion. Allegorically, he represented a warring f action of the self that fights against his own knowledge and is oriented in a highly physical manner. It seemed he went from one extreme to another, being against Christ and then for him. But the inner vehemence was always present, the inner fire, and the recognition that he tried for so long to hide.</details>
他代表的那部分是为了要处理与操纵物质实相的，因而这些特质在他之内本就很强，而多少支配了他。当历史性的基督“死了”之后，保罗就得把灵性的概念具体实践出来，他得继续下去。可是，在如此做时，他种下了一个“组织”的种子，而这个组织将会使那些概念窒息。他在基督之后逗留，[恰]如施洗约翰在基督之前来到。你要知道，这三个人在一起延展了有一段时期。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>His was the portion that was to deal with physical reality and manipulation, and so these qualities were strong in him. To some extent they overruled him. When the historical Christ “died,” Paul was to implement the spiritual ideas in physical terms, to carry on. In so doing, however, he grew the seeds of an organization that would smother the ideas. He lingered after Christ, [just] as John the Baptist came before. Together the three spanned some time period, you see.</details>
约翰与历史上的基督各自演出了他们的角色，并且对自己所作所为感到满意。唯有保罗在最后未感满意，因此那将来的基督会围绕着他的人格而形成。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>John and the historical Christ each performed their roles and were satisfied that they had done so. Paul alone was left at the end unsatisfied, and so it is about his personality that the future Christ will form.</details>
这些人格为其一部分的那个“存有”，你们可称为“基督存有”的那个“存有”，是觉察到这些问题的。俗世的人格则对它们无所觉知，虽然在出神与超越的“狂喜”(exaltation)时刻，他们得知了许多事。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The entity of which these personalities are part, that entity which you may call the Christ entity, was aware of these issues. The earthly personalities were not aware of them, although in periods of trance and exaltation much was made known to them.</details>
保罗同时也代表了人的好战天性，那必须与人类在当时的发展一同纳入考虑。当下一位基督人格出现时，你们所知的人性里那种好战特质将全然改变其性质，并且将被扬弃，因此保罗的在场是很适当的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Paul also represented the militant nature of man, that had to be taken into consideration in line with man’s development at the time. That militant quality in man will completely change its nature, and be dispensed with as you know it, when the next Christ personality emerges. It is therefore appropriate that Paul be present.</details>
(10:27)在下个世纪里，人的内在本性随着这些发展，将把它自己由过去的许多束缚中释放出来。一个新纪元真的会开始——并非一个人间天堂，却是一个更为健全与公正的世界，在其中人更加明白他与地球的关系，以及他在时间这范畴之内的自由。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:27.) In the next century, the inner nature of man, with these developments, will free itself from many constraints that have bound it. A new era will indeed begin ---- not, now, a heaven on earth, but a far more sane and just world, in which man is far more aware of his relationship with his planet and of his freedom within time.</details>
现在你可以在时间之内休息一会儿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take a break in time.</details>
(10:30。大部分的时候珍的步调又都很好，但她很轻易地脱离了出神状态。她对赛斯已点明了基督存有的第三位人格松了一口气。虽然她说她没为这资料挂心，我却知道她比平常更在乎想得到它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:30. Jane’s pace had been good again for the most part, but she came out of trance easily. She was relieved that Seth had named the third personality of the Christ entity. Although she said she hadn’t been worrying about this data, I knew she had been more than usually concerned about getting it.</details>
(在休息时，我们讨论的是我认为读者也许会有兴趣的几点：其一是赛斯用在保罗身上的“狂热分子”指称。最初我以为他会说在保罗、扫罗与狂热派(Zealots)——公元第一世纪时在犹地亚(Judaea)的犹太宗教一个分支——之间有了关联。那时“圣地”被罗马人占领，而保罗是个犹太人又是罗马公民，近来我在一本谈《死海经卷》的书中读到这些支派，而我自己对这经卷与这支派的兴趣，令我颇感困惑；但在今晚听到赛斯所言之后，我假定他不会对这些题目说得太多。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Our discussion at break concerned several other points I thought readers might be interested in: One was the zealot designation Seth applied to Paul. At first I’d thought he was going to say there was a connection between Paul, or Saul, and the Zealots, one of the religious sects the Jewish people had been divided into in Judaea in the first century A.D. The Holy Land was occupied by the Romans then, and Paul was a Jew and a Roman citizen. I’d been reading about these sects recently in a book on the Dead Sea Scrolls, and had been somewhat puzzled by my interest in both the scrolls and the sects; but after hearing Seth tonight I assumed he wasn’t going to say much about these subjects.</details>
(另一个问题是，关于下一世纪里第三位基督出现的国家和祂的名字。同时，赛斯能否或肯否对已生在印度的宗教人物，及将生在非洲的那位黑人提供任何资料？)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Another question concerned a name and country for the appearance of the third Christ in the next century. Also, could or would Seth give any data on the religious figure already born in India, and the black man to be born in Africa?</details>
(当我们在休息期间继续谈天时，珍告诉我，她已知我所问问题的答案。这些答案“来到”她心里，她说她并没得到这资讯的确切字句，但感觉到它而必须加以转译：<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(As we continued to talk during break, Jane then told me she knew the answers to the questions I had asked. The answers had “come” to her. She didn’t get this information in exact words, she said, but felt it and had to translate it:</details>
(一、赛斯把“狂热分子”用在保罗身上的意思，是对他的气质的一个描写——而非涉及“狂热派”的。我后来加的一个注：然而，将会谈到更多关于保罗与狂热派的事。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(1.?Seth had intended the word zealot, as applied to Paul, to be descriptive of his temperament ---- not a reference to the Zealot sect. A note, added later: More was to come on Paul and the Zealots, though.</details>
(二、那个在下个世纪将眼见第三位基督出现的国家——其名字与日期——现在还不会给我们，但可能以后会给。她说，赛斯曾故意地抑制自己不要更加明确。这是为了防止大众对生在某特定国家、似乎符合他所给的描写与日期的人产生过度反应。那样就会非常不公道而且令人误入歧途。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(2.?The country ---- with a name and dates ---- which would see the appearance of the third Christ in the next century, would not be given to us now, but might be in later years. Seth, she said, had deliberately refrained from being more specific. This was to prevent any overre actions to every personage born in a particular country, who might seem to fit descriptions and dates given. This would be very unfair and misleading.</details>
(三、为了相同的理由，赛斯在这时对于印度的宗教人物，与未来将在印尼工作的非洲人也不再多说。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(3.?For the same reason Seth wouldn’t say more at this time concerning the Indian religious figure, and the to-be-born African who would work in Indonesia.)</details>
(在10:50继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Resume at 10:50.)</details>
现在，我们继续吧。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Let us continue.</details>
鲁柏刚才给你的答复是对的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Ruburt was correct in the answers he just gave you.</details>
我想澄清某些点。这随着“基督再临”而来的“新宗教”，将不是你们所谓的基督教，虽然基督的第三位人格将创始它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I would like to make certain points clear. The “new religion” following the Second Coming will not be Christian in your terms, although the third personality of Christ will initiate it.</details>
这人格将提及历史上的基督，将认知祂自己与那人格的关系；但在他之内，这三人组合将形成一个新的心灵“存有”，一个不同的“心理完形”。当这蜕变发生时，它在人类的层面启动一个蜕变(强调地)，因为人的内在能力将被接受与开发。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This personality will refer to the historical Christ, will recognize his relationship with that personality; but within him the three personality groupings will form a new psychic entity, a different psychological gestalt. As this metamorphosis takes place, it will initiate a metamorphosis on a human level also (emphatically), as man’s inner abilities are accepted and developed.</details>
其结果是一种不同的存在。你们现在的许多问题是来自灵性上的无知。当人们认识到自己的存在也包括了这种合众关系(membership)，没有人会鄙视来自另一族的人。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The results will be a different kind of existence. Many of your problems now result from spiritual ignorance. No man will look down upon an individual from another race when he himself recognizes that his own existence includes such membership also.</details>
(10:55)当每个个人都知觉到他自己在社会许多层面与角色中的经验，没有一个性别会被认为优于另一个性别，在社会里的任何角色也没有优劣之分。一个无限制的(openended)的意识将感觉到它与所有其他“有情”间的关联。(停顿。)意识的连续性将变得很明显。由于所有这些发展的必然结果，社会与政府的结构将会改变，因为它们是建立在你们目前的信念上的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:55.) No sex will be considered better than the other, or any role in society, when each individual is aware of his own or her own experience at many levels of society and in many roles. An open-ended consciousness will feel its connections with all other living beings. (Pause.) The continuity of consciousness will become apparent. As a result of all this the social and governmental structures will change, for they are based upon your current beliefs.</details>
人类人格将获得现在看来似不可能的好处。一个无限制的意识将暗示更多的自由。从出生开始，儿童将被教导“人的基本身份并不依赖身体”，以及“你所知的时间是个幻相”。孩子会觉察许多个过去世，也能认同在你们说来将会变成的老人或老妇。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Human personality will reap benefits that now would seem unbelievable. An open-ended consciousness will imply far greater freedom. From birth, children will be taught that basic identity is not dependent upon the body, and that time as you know it is an illusion . The child will be aware of many of its past existences, and will be able to identify with the old man or woman that in your terms it will become.</details>
(11:02)那时青年人就可得到许多所谓“随年岁而来”的教训，但老人却不会失去他们年轻时在灵性上的弹性。这点本身就很重要。但为了现实的理由，未来的转世将仍会被隐蔽一段时间。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(11:02.) Many of the lessons “that come with age” will then be available to the young, but the old will not lose the spiritual elasticity of their youth. This itself is important. But for some time, future incarnations will still be hidden for practical reasons.</details>
当这些改变发生的时候，在脑内新的区域会被发动，以便实际地处理它们。那么，肉体上，绘制脑子的地图将是可能的，在其间往世的记忆被唤起。所有这些改变是灵性上的，在其中宗教的意义将逃过组织的束缚，而变成个人生活中活生生的一部分，在那儿，心灵架构而非物质架构形成文明的基础。(在11:05停顿，眼睛闭着。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>As these changes come about, new areas will be activated in the brain to physically take care of them. Physically then, brain mappings will be possible in which Past-life memories are evoked. All of these alterations are spiritual changes in which the meaning of religion will escape organizational bounds, become a living part of individual existence, and where psychic frameworks rather than physical ones form the foundations for civilization. (Pause, eyes closed, at 11:05.)</details>
人的经验将会如此扩展，以致在你们看来，人类种族似乎变作了另一种。这并不表示不再会有问题。但的确表示人将有更为博大的资源供其运用，而且也预设了一个更丰富与多变化的社会架构。不论男女都会发现“四海之内皆兄弟”，他们之间不仅以今生的关系相待，而且也包括了前世的关系。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Man’s experience will be so extended that to you the species will seem to have changed into another. This does not mean there will not be problems. It does mean that man will have far greater resources at his command. It also presupposes a richer and far more diverse social framework. Men and women will find themselves relating to their brethren, not only as the people that they are, but as the people that they were.</details>
家庭关系也许会出现最大的改变，在家庭内将容许现在所不可能有的情感互动。意识心将更觉察到无意识的资料。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Family relationships will show perhaps the greatest changes. There will be room for emotional interactions within the family that are now impossible. The conscious mind will be more aware of unconscious material.</details>
我把这些资料包括在这谈宗教的一章里，因为你们必须了悟，许多问题的根源正在于精神上的无知，而你们唯一的限制的确是精神方面的限制。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I am including this information in this chapter on religion because it is important that you realize that spiritual ignorance is at the basis of so many of your problems, and that indeed your only limitations are spiritual ones.</details>
(11:14)我先前提到在第三个人格方面的蜕变，将有如此的力量与威力，会从人类本身之内唤出这种同样的特质，这些特质是一直都在的。它们终究会突破肉体感知力的重重面纱，以新的方式扩展那感知力。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(11:14.) The metamorphosis mentioned earlier on the part of the third personality, will have such strength and power that it will call out from mankind these same qualities from within itself. The qualities have always been present. They will finally break through the veils of physical perception, extending that perception in new ways.</details>
现在，人类缺少这样一种焦点，而第三位人格将代表那个焦点。附带地说，在那场戏里将没有“钉十字架”这回事。那个人格将真的是多次元性的，明白祂自己所有的转世，祂将不把自己限定一种性别、一种肤色、一个种族。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now, mankind lacks such a focus. The third personality will represent that focus. There will be, incidentally, no crucifixion in that drama. That personality will indeed be multidimensional, aware of all its incarnations. It will not be oriented in terms of one sex, one color, or one race.</details>
(11:20)因此，前所未有的，祂将突破对人格的俗世观念，解放人格。祂将有能力随意表现这些不同的效果。将会有很多人害怕接受他们自己实相的本质，或被示以真正本体的各个面向(dimensions)。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(11:20.) For the first time, therefore, it will break through the earthly concepts of personality, liberating personality. It will have the ability to show these diverse effects as it chooses. There will be many who will be afraid to accept the nature of their own reality, or to be shown the dimensions of true identity.</details>
为了鲁柏所提到的几个理由，关于祂将用的名字或诞生的地方，我将不提供更多详细的资讯。太多人也许会在时机未成熟时就被诱惑跳进那形象里去。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>For several reasons, as mentioned by Ruburt, I do not want to give any more detailed information as to the name that will be used, or the land of birth. Too many might be tempted to jump into that image prematurely.</details>
所有的事情并不是预先注定的。不过，为了这个“显现”所作的架构，已在你们的可能系统里建立了。这第三位人格的显现，将直接地影响现在所知原本的基督历史剧。在这“显现”和那历史剧之间必然有相互的影响。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Events are not predestined. The framework for this emergence has already been set, however, within your system of Probabilities. The emergence of this third personality will directly affect the original historical drama of Christ as it is now known. There is and must be interactions between them.</details>
你可以休息一下，或结束此节，随你的便。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break, or end the session as you prefer.</details>
(“我们就休息一下吧。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“We’ll take the break.”</details>
(11:25。我选了休息是指望可能有更多的资讯会透过来。珍说她记不起自上次休息后的任何资料，在出神状态中她没有时间消逝的感觉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(11:25. I asked for a break on the chance that more information might come through for the chapter. Jane said she couldn’t remember any of the data given since last break. She’d had no sense of time passing while in trance.</details>
(我俩都累了，也都饿了，所以我们考虑过结束此节，而在我们弄点东西吃时，一边看看电视上的旧悬疑片或恐怖片。然后我想起赛斯尚未给他的书头八章的标题。他在第十七章里曾叫我们别担心此事。他能否现在给那些标题，或珍必须先看一遍那些早期资料？虽然说起来似乎不可能，但从她早在第四章停止一节一节地看此书后，已经过去了一年多。在11:39继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Both of us were getting tired. We were also hungry, so we thought of ending the session and watching an old mystery or horror movie on TV while we had something to eat. Then I remembered that Seth hadn’t given headings for the first eight chapters of his book. He’d told us not to worry about this in Chapter Seventeen. Could he give the headings now, or would Jane have to go over that early material first? Impossible as it seemed, well over a year had passed since she had stopped reading the book, session by session, early in Chapter Four. Resume at 11:39.)</details>
在对你们的两个问题回答一、两句后，我就向你们道晚安了。再次的，鲁柏今天下午已由我处收到了这个：当我偏离了最先所给你们的大纲时(在1970年1月19日的第510节里)，我就会给章节的标题。不然的话，那些在大纲里所作的声明仍然适用。如果你想要的话，你就可以自己把标题加上去。我插入了许多本未提及的章节，所以从以后就用那些标题。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: I will bid you a fond good evening after a few remarks in answer to your question. Again, Ruburt picked this up from me this afternoon: When I deviated from the original outline as given (in the 510th session for January 19, 1970), I gave chapter headings. Otherwise those statements made in the outline apply. You can simply add them if you prefer. I inserted many chapters where none were mentioned, and so used the headings from then onward.</details>
现在，你还有别的问题吗？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now, do you have more questions?</details>
(“有的，但我想我们以后再问吧。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Yes, but I guess we’ll ask them later.”</details>
(幽默地，眼睛大睁而非常黑：)你不来上(ESP)课，因此你不可能很想念我。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Humorously, eyes wide and very dark): You did not come to [ESP] class, so you could not have missed me very much.</details>
(“我是常常想念你的。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“I missed you a great deal.”)</details>
我们也将有一节私人的课，并继续我们的书。我想念我们的私人课。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We will have a personal session also, and continue with our book. And I missed our private sessions.</details>
(“我也是的。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“So did I.”)</details>
为了你自己的自由，有些晚上你们还是可以录音并与我谈天，不必记录。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You can still record and chat with me, without notes, some evening for your own freedom.</details>
(“那就是我拿录音机去修理的原因。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“That’s why I’m having our recorder fixed.”)</details>
那么，我最衷心地祝福，晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My fondest regards then, and good evening.</details>
(“赛斯，非常谢谢你，和你谈话很愉快。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Thank you very much, Seth. It’s been a pleasure.”)</details>
那永远是件乐事。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It’s always a pleasure.</details>
(我对这幽默的加重语气发笑。“晚安。”在11:45结束。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(I laughed at the humorous emphasis. “Good night.” End at 11:45 P.M.)</details>
