<a id=1 href=1>FEBRUARY 17, 1971, 9:14 P.M. WEDNESDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年2月17日 星期三 晚上9：14</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will resume dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们继续口述。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The nature of matter itself is not understood. You perceive it at a certain “stage.” Using your terms now and speaking as simply as possible, there are other forms of matter beyond those you see. These forms are quite real and vivid, quite “physical,” to those who react to that particular sphere of activity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>物质的性质还没有被了解。你们在某一“阶段”感知到它。现在用你们的说法而尽量简单地说，在你们所见的物质之外还有其他形式的物质，这些形式是相当真实而生动的。对于那些对那个特定的活动层面有反应的人来说，它们是相当“具体”的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In terms of Probabilities, therefore, you choose certain acts, unconsciously transform these into physical events or objects, and then perceive them. But those unchosen events also go out from you and are projected into these other forms. Now the behavior of atoms and molecules is involved here, for again these are only present within your universe during certain stages. Their activity is perceived only during the range of particular vibratory rhythms. When your scientists examine them for example, they do not examine the nature, say, of an atom. They only explore the characteristics of an atom as it acts or shows itself within your system. Its greater reality completely escapes them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，就可能性来说，你选择某些行为，无意识地把它转变成具体的事件或物体，然后再去感知它。但那些没被选择的事件，也由你发出而投射成其他的形式。现在此地涉及了原子和分子的行为，因为再次的，这些原子、分子只在某特定的“阶段”才在你们的物质宇宙内出现。它们的活动只在某特定的震动频率范围下才能被你们所感知。举例来说，当你们的科学家检验它们时，他们并没检验，好比说，一个原子的本质，他们只在探索一个原子在你们的系统里活动或出现时的特征。它更大的实相完全逃过了他们的注意。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:24.) You understand that there are spectrums of light. So are there spectrums of matter. Your system of physical reality is not dense in comparison with some others. The dimensions that you give to physical matter barely begin to hint at the varieties of dimensions possible.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:25)你们知道光有光谱。因此物质也有“谱”。与某些其他的比较，你们的物质实相系统不是很密实的。你给物体的长、宽、高的次元，其实才只开始暗示到一点可能有的各种不同次元。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Some systems are far heavier or lighter than your own, though this may not involve weight in the terms with which you are familiar. Probable actions emerge, then, into matter-systems quite as valid as your own, and quite as consistent. You are used to thinking in single-line thoughts, so you think of events that you know as complete things or actions, not realizing that what you perceive is but a fr action of their entire multidimensional existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些系统比你们的重得多或轻得多，虽然这不一定涉及你所熟悉的所谓“重量”。那么，可能的行动就进入了和你自己的系统同样确实、同样一致的物质系统(matter-systems)里。你惯于单线式的思考，因此你把你所知的事件想作是完整的东西或行动，没想到你所感知的只是它们整个多次元存在的一小部分而已。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30.) In greater terms, it is impossible to separate one physical event from the probable events, for these are all dimensions of one action. It is basically impossible to separate the “you” that you know from the probable you’s of which you are unaware, for the same reasons. There are always inner pathways, however, leading between probable events; since all of them are manifestations of an act in its becoming, then the dimensions between these are illusion s.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30)广义地说，是不可能将一个实质事件与所有那些可能事件分开的，因为这些全是一个行动的各种面目。同理，基本上不可能把你所知的“你”和你不知的可能的你分开。不过，在各个可能事件之间，总是有内在的通道；既然它们全是一个行动在其成形中的表现，那么在这些事件之间的次元就是个幻相。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The physical brain alone cannot pick up these connections with any great success. The mind, which is the inner counterpart of the brain, can at times perceive the far greater dimensions of any given event through a burst of sudden intuition or comprehension that cannot be adequately described on a verbal level.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>光是实质的脑本身无法清楚察觉到这些关联，而其内在的对等物——心——有时则能感知到任一事件深远得多的次元，经由突发的顿悟，或无法适当用语言形容的领悟。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:35.) As I have said frequently, time as you think of it does not exist, yet in your terms, time’s true nature could be understood if the basic nature of the atom was ever made known to you. In one way, an atom could be compared to a microsecond.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:35停顿。)如我常说的，你所认为的时间是不存在的，可是在你们来说，如果原子的基本性质一旦为你所知，你就能了解时间的真正本质。在一方面来说，一个原子可以比作一百万分之一秒(microsecond)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It seems as if an atom “exists” steadily for a certain amount of time. Instead it phases in and out, so to speak. It fluctuates in a highly predictable pattern and rhythm. It can be perceived within your system only at certain points in this fluctuation, so it seems to scientists that the atom is steadily present. They are not aware of any gaps of absence as far as the atom is concerned.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>看起来，一个原子好像稳定地“存在”了一段时间。其实不然，可以说，它是逐渐出现又逐渐消失，如此反复不已。它以一种极可预期的模式和节奏在波动。在你们的系统里，只有在这起伏的某些刹那，你们才能看到它，因此对科学家来说，原子似乎是稳定地存在着。他们不觉知原子有时候“不在”这儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:41.) In those periods of nonphysical projection, the off periods of fluctuation, the atoms “appear” in another system of reality. In that system they are perceived in what are “on” points of fluctuation, and in that system also then the atoms (seem to) appear steadily. There are many such points of fluctuation, but your system of course is not aware of them, nor of the ultimate actions, universes, and systems that exist within them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:41)在它们没投射到物质世界的那些时刻，波动之“不在”的一刹那，原子“出现”在另一个实相系统里。在那个系统里，原子在波动之“在”的一刹那被感知到，于是，在那系统里原子也(似乎)看来很稳定。有许多这种波动的刹那，但自然你们的系统对它无所知，也不知存在于它们之内的最终行动、众多的物质宇宙和系统。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now the same sort of behavior occurs on a deep, basic, secret, and unexplored psychological level. The physically oriented consciousness, responding to one phase of the atom’s activity, comes alive and awake to its particular existence, but in between are other fluctuations in which consciousness is focused upon entirely different systems of reality; each of these coming awake and responding, and each one having no sense of absence, and memory only of those particular fluctuations to which they respond.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在，同类的行为也在一个深沉的、基本的、秘密的、未被探索的心理层面发生。以肉体为依归的意识只对原子活动的一个相位(phase)反应，而对那个特定的存在“醒来”并反应了起来，但在其间还有别的波动，在这些波动中，意识贯注在全然不同的各个实相系统上，它们每一个都“醒来”并反应，而却不觉察有什么东西“不在”，并且只记得他们对之反应的那一特定的波动。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:47 to 10:06.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:47—10:06)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Resume dictation. These fluctuations are actually simultaneous. It would seem to you as if there would be gaps between the fluctuations, and the description I have used is the best one for our purposes; but the probable systems all exist simultaneously, and basically, following this discussion, the atom is in all these other systems at one time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>继续口述。所有这些波动其实是同时发生的。在你们看来似乎在“波动”之间应该存在着空隙，而我刚才的描述已经算是最好的一个了；但可能的系统全都同时存在，基本上，照这样说，原子是“同时”在所有这些其他的系统里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now we have been speaking in terms of fantastically swift pulses or fluctuations, so smooth and “brief” that you do not notice them. But there are also “slower,” “more vast,” “longer” fluctuations from your end of the scale.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在我们所说的是绝快的脉动或波动，如此平顺而“短暂”，以致于你不会注意到它在波动，但由你们人间那端来看，也还有“较慢的”、“更广的”、“较长的”一些波动。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:14.) These affect entirely different systems of existence than any closely connected with your own The experience of such kinds of consciousness is highly alien to you. One such fluctuation might take several thousand of your years, for example. These several thousand years would be experienced, say, as a second of your time, with the events occurring within it perceived simply as a “present period.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:14)这些波动影响到全然不同的存在系统，而非任何一个与你们自己系统密切相连的系统。这些种类意识的经历对你而言极为陌生。举例来说，一次这种波动可以用上你们的几千年。这几千年会被经历为，好比说，你们时间的一秒，而其中发生的事件则只被感知为一个“当下片刻”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now the consciousness of such beings would also contain the consciousness of large numbers of probable selves and systems, experienced quite vividly and clearly as multiple presents. These multiple presents can be altered at any of an actual number of infinite points; infinity not existing in terms of one indefinite line, but in terms of numberless Probabilities and possible combinations growing out of each act of consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，这类“存有”的意识也包括了很多的可能自己与可能系统的意识，而这些可能的自己与可能的系统都十分生动、清楚的被体验为“多重的现在”。这些“多重现在”能在无限个点的任一点被改变；所谓“无限”并非以一条无限的线那样存在着，而是指由意识的每一动念生出来的无量的可能性及“可能的组合”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:25.) Such beings, with their multiple presents, may or may not be aware of your particular system. Their multiple present may or may not include it. You may be a part of their multiple present without even being aware of it. In much more limited terms your probable realities are multiple presents. (Long pause.) The image, for an analogy, of an e-y-e (spelled out) within an eye within an eye, endlessly repeated, may be useful here. End of that chapter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:25)这些有“多重现在”的“存有”，对你们的特定系统也许会感知，也许不会感知。他们的“多重现在”也许包括了“人间”，也许没有包括。也许你是他们“多重现在”的一部分而未曾知觉。以远为狭义的说法，你的可能实相即“多重现在”。(停顿很久。)一个眼睛中有个眼睛，这眼睛中又有个眼睛，如此无限重复的影像也许差可比拟。此章结束。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:29. Jane’s delivery had been smooth and easy, seemingly effortless. I told her the material was excellent. I found statements like, “In one way, an atom could be compared to a microsecond,” particularly evocative.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:29停顿。珍讲得很顺溜轻松，似乎毫不费力。我告诉她资料棒极了。我发觉像“一方面来说，一个原子可以比作一百万分之一秒”这种声明特别的发人深省。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(After a very short break Jane gave several pages of material for us. The session ended at about 11:25 P.M.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在一个很短的休息之后，珍给了我们自己几页的资料。这节约在11:25结束。)</a>
