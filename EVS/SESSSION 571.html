<div style="display:inline">(赛斯——珍今晚说话的速度，不久就逼得我以非常快的步调跟着写，以便跟上去。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Seth-Jane’s delivery soon had me writing along at a very brisk pace in order to keep up.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们继续口述。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: We will resume dictation.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好的。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“All right.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你也可由清醒状态的直接经验，来检查意识的这些不同阶段及心灵活动的波动。在下一章我们将让你对自己实相这些永远活跃的部分变得更有所觉。此章完毕。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>These various stages of consciousness and fluctuations of psychic activity can also be examined through direct experience from the waking state. In the following chapter we will let you become more aware of these ever-active portions of your own reality. End of chapter.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(赛斯上次告诉我们他已接近此章结尾，但我们当然没想到，他会在下一节中以一两句话来结束。我们也不知道他为何要选择这个方法，好像两节之间的空档对他不存在似的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Seth had told us last time that he was near the end of the chapter, but we hadn’t realized of course that he was to finish it with a sentence or two in the next session. Nor did we know why he chose this method. It was as though the break between sessions didn’t exist for him.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(今晚我本想问他这事，但很遗憾的一直没问。既然珍不看这书，她是没法在这种地方提醒我的，除非我刚巧跟她讨论过，而我也忘了那样做。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(I meant to quiz him about this tonight, but regretfully never did so. Since Jane doesn’t look at the book, she is unable to remind me of such points unless I happen to discuss them with her, and I forgot to do that, too.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">第十八章 意识的种种阶段、象征和多重焦点</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>CHAPTER 18 VARIOUS STAGES OF CONSCIOUSNESS, SYMBOLISM, AND MULTIPLE FOCUS</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">下一章将叫作〈意识的种种阶段、象征和多重焦点〉。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The next chapter will be called: “Various Stages of Consciousness, Symbolism, and Multiple Focus.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不论你知道还是不知道，你意识的所有各面都聚合在你自己的人格内。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Within your own personality all facets of your consciousness converge, whether or not you are aware of it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(停顿良久；在这一点步调还是很慢。)显然意识能被转向许多方向，包括向内与向外的。你对你正常意识的波动有所知觉，更密切的注意会使这些波动中的有一些十分清晰。你不断地扩大或收缩注意力的范围。有时你也许会贯注于一件东西，几乎到了对其他所有东西浑然不觉的地步，因而你真的对自己身坐其中的房间也不知道了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Long pause; the pace was still slow at this point.) Consciousness can be turned in many directions, obviously, both inward and outward. You are aware of fluctuations in your normal consciousness, and closer attention would make some of this quite clear. You expand or narrow the scope of your attention constantly. You may focus upon one object almost to the exclusion of everything else at times, so that you literally are not conscious of the room in which you sit.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可能对一件记起来的事如此“有意识”，并且对它反应如此强烈，以致你相对地对眼前的事浑然不觉。你把所有这些意识的起伏视为当然，它们不会使你不安。如果你看书看得一时忘了你置身的环境，你不会害怕当你想把注意力转回到现实时，它会不见了。在一个白日梦里，你通常也不会担忧能不能回到现前这一刻来。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may be “conscious” and reacting to a remembered event so strongly that you are relatively unaware of present events. You take all of these fluctuations for granted. They do not disturb you. If you are lost in a book and unaware momentarily of your immediate environment, you are not afraid that it will be gone when you want to turn your attention back to it. Nor in a daydream do you usually worry about returning safely to the present moment.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">到某个程度，所有这些都是你的意识流动性以及它能很容易被利用的小例子。以一种奇怪的方式，象征可以被看成是你在意识各不同层面的“知觉方式”的实例。它们变换的扮相可以作为路标。例如，火是一个具体化了的象征，因此一个真的火显然告诉你，你是在以你调整到肉体的意识去感知实相。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>To some extent, all of these are small examples of the mobility of your consciousness, and the ease with which it can be used. In a strange manner, symbols can be regarded as samples of the way you perceive at various levels of consciousness. Their changing guises can be used as signposts. Fire, for example, is a symbol made physical, so a real fire tells you obviously that you are perceiving reality with your physically attuned consciousness.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:33)一个想象的火的画面，自动地告诉你，这儿已涉及了另一种意识状态。一个在脑海里看见的火，温暖却不会烧毁东西，则显然表示另一些事。所有的象征意在表达感受，那些永不能以文字来适当表达的感受。象征代表感受的无穷变化，而在不同的意识阶段，这些象征会以不同的方式出现，但它们却会永远伴随你。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:33.) A mental picture of a fire automatically tells you that another kind of consciousness is involved. A fire mentally seen that has warmth but does not burn destructively obviously means something else. All symbols are an attempt to express feelings, feelings that can never be expressed adequately through language. Symbols represent the infinite variations of feelings, and in various stages of consciousness these will appear in different terms, but they will always accompany you.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，也有几种例外，在其中涉及了纯知识或纯感受而无象征的必要。意识的这些阶段是很少有的，而且很少被转译为正常有意识的说法。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There are several exceptions, however, in which pure knowing or pure feeling is involved without the necessity for symbols. These stages of consciousness are infrequent and seldom translated into normal conscious terms.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">让我们拿一种特定的感受为例，追踪它，看它在意识的各不同阶段可能以什么样子被表达出来。(停顿。)以一种喜悦的感觉开始。在正常意识，此人会以一种非常不同于他在低潮时的方式去感知切身的环境。喜悦之情改变了物体本身，在于感知者以光明得多的看法去看它们，以便以更清晰的方法创造出较鲜明的物体，于是环境之美以回馈的方式似乎更加强了他的喜悦。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Let us take a particular feeling and follow it through as it might be expressed at various levels of consciousness. (Pause.) Begin with a feeling of joy. In normal consciousness, the immediate environment will be perceived in a far different manner than it would be, say, if an individual were in a state of depression. The feeling of joy changes the objects themselves, in that the perceiver sees them in a far brighter light. He creates the objects far more vividly and with greater clarity. In feedback fashion, the environment then seems to reinforce his joy.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:41)可是，他所见的仍是具体的、物质世界的物体。现在，假装他开始作白日梦而落入一个幻想里。物体、人物或事件的画面或象征来到他内心，也许是来自过去、或现在、或将来的想象，此时这喜悦在精神上以更大的自由表现，但那是以象征来表现的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:41.) What he sees, however, is still physical, the objects of the material world. Pretend now that he begins to daydream and falls into a reverie. Into his inner mind come pictures or symbols of material objects, people or events, from perhaps the past as well as present and future imaginings, the joy now being expressed with greater freedom mentally, but with symbols.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">可以说，这喜悦延伸到将来，光明也照耀到过去，可能涵盖了比在那一刻能以具体方式表现的更大范围。再来想象这个人由幻想落入一个出神状态或一个深睡中。(停顿良久。)他可能看到对他非常具象征性的喜悦或兴致勃勃的影像。逻辑上说，它们之间可能没多少关联，但在直觉上这关联是很清楚的。他现在比在幻想状态进入了深得多的精神体验，而可能有一连串的梦，在梦中他能表达他的喜悦而与他人分享。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The joy stretches out, so to speak, into the future, sheds also its light into the past, and may cover greater areas of expansion than could be shown in physical terms at that moment. Now imagine that our individual from his reverie falls either into a trance state or into a deep sleep. (Long pause.) He may see images that are highly symbolic to him of joy or exuberance. Logically there may be little connection between them, but intuitively the connections are clear. He now enters into hismental experiences far more deeply than in the reverie state, and may have a series of dream episodes in which he is able to express his joy and share it with others.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，他还是在与物质取向的象征打交道。现在，既然我们在用这个讨论作为一个例子，我们就更进一步的继续追踪它吧。这个人可能形成非常快乐的梦中城市或人们，把快乐情绪的本身转译成对他而言很“恰当”的不管什么象征。洋洋喜气可能被转译成在嬉戏的动物、飞翔的人或极美的动物或景色。再次的，仍然缺乏逻辑性的关联，但整个插曲将被这情绪串连起来。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>He is still dealing with physically oriented symbols, however. Now since we are using this discussion as a case in point we will continue to follow it even further. He may form images of dream cities or people that are of a very joyful nature, translate the emotion itself into whatever symbols are pertinent to him. An exuberance may be translated into images of playing animals, flying people, or animals or landscapes of great beauty. Again, the logical connections will be lacking, but the entire episode will be connected by this emotion.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:51)这同时，肉体会得到极大的好处，因为那有益的感觉自动更新并加强身体的复健能力。喜悦的感觉可能会导出基督、佛陀或先知的形象。这些象征是意识在各不同阶段具特征性的变换场景。这经验应被当作是创造；意识在各不同阶段天赋的创造行为。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:51.) The physical body all the while is greatly benefitted, because the beneficial feelings automatically renew and replenish its recuperative abilities. The feelings of joy now may lead to images of Christ, Buddha, or the prophets. These symbols are the changing scenes characteristic of consciousness at various stages. The experiences are to be considered as creations; creative acts all native to consciousness at various stages.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在超越这一点之后的那些状态里，象征本身开始渐渐消失，变得模糊而遥远。在此处你开始缩回到那种意识的区域，在其中，象征变得越来越不必要了，而它的确是个少有人烟的区域。象征闪烁明灭，最后终于消失不见。意识离物质越来越远。在意识的这个阶段，灵魂发现它自己孤单地与自己的感受在一起，剥除了象征与画面，而开始感知只有它自知的庞大实相。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Beyond this are states in which the symbols themselves begin to fade away, become indistinct, distant. Here you begin to draw into regions of consciousness in which symbols become less and less necessary, and it is a largely unpopulated area indeed. Representations blink off and on, and finally disappear. Consciousness is less and less physically oriented. In this stage of consciousness the soul finds itself alone with its own feelings, stripped of symbolism and representations, and begins to perceive the gigantic reality of its own knowing.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">它感受到直接的体验。如果我们用喜悦作例子，所有它精神性的象征与形象最后都会消失。它们曾由“喜悦”浮现、也将离它而去，因为它们并非原始经验而是副产品。灵魂于是开始以几乎无法解释的方式探索这喜悦的实相，而在如此做时，它将学会以前它绝对不能理解的感知、表现与实现的方法。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It feels direct experience. If we use joy as our example, allmental symbols and images of it would finally disappear. They had emerged from it, and would fall away from it, not being the original experience, but by-products. The soul would then begin to explore the reality of this joy in terms that can hardly be explained, and in so doing would learn methods of perception, expression, and actualization that would have been utterly incomprehensible to it before.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:01。珍的步调一直很好。我告诉她我认为这节棒极了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:01. Jane’s pace had been consistently good. I told her I thought the session was excellent.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在休息时我们每人各提出一个问题。我要确定到现在为止，所给的关于“说法者”的资料是否对他们用什么方法接触在清醒时与作梦时的人，作了足够的探讨。我要知道更多关于训练“说法者”的事，由谁来主持，以及他们的直觉与梦的经验。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(At break each of us mentioned a question. I wanted to be sure that the material given on the Speakers, so far, adequately dealt with the methods by which they were able to contact others in both the waking and dream states. I wanted to know more about the Speakers’ training, by whom it was conducted, and their intuitions and dream experiences.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(珍的问题则来自第十四章第560节的资料：她想知道赛斯主张组成基督本体的三个人中，第三个人格的名字〔在珍自己的书《灵界的讯息》第十八章，赛斯给了这基督本体的成员：当然，包括基督本人，还有施洗约翰〕，我现在告诉珍，我想赛斯预备在此书后面更透彻地讨论这整个事情。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane’s question arose out of material in the 560th session in Chapter Fourteen: She wanted to know the name of the third personality making up the three-part Christ entity that Seth has postulated. [In Chapter Eighteen of Jane’s own book, The Seth Material, Seth gave as members of this entity Christ, of course, and John the Baptist.] I told Jane now that I thought Seth intended to go into this whole matter much more thoroughly later in this book.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在10:19以较快的步调继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Resume at a faster pace at 10:19.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：在你们的种种象征中，物体是最明显的一种，而就是为这缘故，你根本没了悟它们竟是象征。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Physical objects are the most obvious of your symbols, and precisely for that reason you do not realize that they are symbols at all.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在不同的层面，意识运用不同类的象征。象征是表达内在实相的一个方法。灵魂向一个方向工作时，它用它的意识，透过尽可能多的象征，透过活的、变化不定的象征意义来表达内在实相。于是，每个象征本身多少自己都有意识、独特性和知觉。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>At different levels, consciousness works with different kinds of symbols. Symbols are a method of expressing inner reality. Working in one direction the soul, using its consciousness, expresses inner reality through as many symbols as possible, through living, changing symbolism. Each symbol itself then is to its own extent conscious, individual, and aware.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在如此做时，灵魂继续创造出新的、可被探索的内在实相。而当灵魂向可说是相反的方向工作时，它自己剥除了所有的象征、所有的代表，而以不同的方式，用它的意识学着探索自己直接的经验。在它与经验之间没有夹着象征，它在一种价值完成(value fulfillment)中完美它自己，那是你目前所无法了解的，除了象征性地了解外。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In so doing, the soul continually creates new varieties of inner reality to be explored. Working in the opposite direction, so to speak, the soul divests itself of all symbols, all representations, and using its consciousness in a different way learns to probe its own direct experience. Without symbols to come between it and experience, it perfects itself in a kind of value fulfillment that you presently cannot understand except symbolically.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不论你醒或睡，这些努力在继续着。可是，一旦你知觉到这些活动，你就可能在意识的不同阶段里抓到自己，甚至有时候——尤其是通过梦境——追随你自己的进展。在这一个时刻，你的身体是你最亲密也是最明显的象征。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now these efforts go on whether you wake or sleep. Once you are aware of these activities, however, it is possible to catch yourself in various stages of consciousness, and even at times to follow your own progress, particularly through dream states. Your body is your most intimate symbol at this point, and again your most obvious.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:23)在大多数的意识阶段里，你会用到你具有一个身体的概念。当你在任一种“出体”经验里离开了你的肉体时，你实际上只是离开它，进入另一个稍微不那么具体的身体而已。接着这个身体“后来”也被舍弃而有个更不具体的身体，但“形体”的概念是个这么重要的象征，以致于你们所有的宗教文学与来世的故事都一直流传着这个象征。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:23.) You will use the idea of a body in most stages of consciousness. When you leave your physical body in any kind of out-of-body experience, you actually leave it in another that is only slightly less physical. This in turn is “later” discarded for one still less physical, but the idea of the form is so important a symbol that you carry it through all of your religious literature, and stories of hereafter.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在某一点，它会与其他的象征一同消失。其实以你们的说法，在造作象征之前曾有一个时期；这时期与你们对实相的概念离得那么远，以致只有在睡眠最受保护的区域里，任何对于它的记忆才曾回来过。在你们看来，没有象征就只有“非存在”(nonbeing)，但既然你们是如此的“着相”(symbol-oriented)，这是一个最自然不过的推论。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>At one point it will vanish with the other symbols. Now there was a time, speaking in your terms, before the making of symbols; a time so divorced from your idea of reality that only in the most protected areas of sleep does any memory of it ever return. It seems to you that without symbols there would be nonbeing, but this is a natural enough deduction since you are so symbol-oriented.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(珍的传递自休息后就一直很快，而且继续如此。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane’s delivery had been fast ever since break, and continued so.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那些发生于死后的意识阶段，仍然全在与象征打交道，虽然在它的运用上有大得多的自由，对它们的意义也有更多的了解。但在意识的较高阶段就不再需要象征了，而“创造”的发生完全不用“象征”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Those stages of consciousness that occur after death still all deal with symbols, though there is much greater freedom in their use, and greater understanding of their meaning. But in higher stages of consciousness, the symbols are no longer necessary, and creativity takes place completely without their use.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">显然你现在还无法觉知意识的那个阶段，但你可以把在醒时生活与梦境中“象征”对你出现的方式记下来，而学着把它们与它们所代表的感觉连起来。你会学到在意识的不同阶段，某些象征会个别的出现，而这些可在你自己的探索中作为“认知点”。例如，当鲁柏在梦中将要离开他的身体时，他常发现自己在一个给他一些探索机会的奇怪房子或公寓里。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Obviously you cannot become aware of that stage of consciousness now, but you can keep track of the way symbols appear to you in both waking life and the dream state, and learn to connect them with the feelings they represent. You will learn that certain symbols will appear personally to you at various stages of consciousness, and these can serve as points of recognition in your own explorations. When Ruburt is about to leave his body from the dream state for example, he will often find himself in a strange house or apartment that offers opportunities for exploration.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">永远是不同的房子或公寓，可是这象征永远是个路标，指出你已达到意识的特定一点，并已准备好进入意识的另一个阶段。你们每个人都有对你非常独特而具同样功用的某些象征。可是，除非你努力去自我探索，否则你在意识层上不会了解这些象征性的路标。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The houses or apartments will always be different, and yet the symbol is always a signpost that he has reached a particular point of consciousness, and is ready to enter another state of consciousness. Each of you will have certain symbols that serve the same kind of purpose, highly individual to you. Unless you make an effort at self-exploration, however, these symbolic guideposts will make no conscious sense.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:36)有些这种象征会跟着你一辈子。有些在大转变时期也会改变它们的特性，当这些你无意识地与之熟悉的象征历经变形时，会导致某种迷失方向的感觉。类似的事也适用于你的日常生活。例如，也许狗对你而言是个自然的喜悦或自由的象征，但在看到一只狗遭横死的意外后，狗对你可能代表一些完全不同的东西了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:36.) Some such symbols stay with you for life. Some in periods of great change may also alter their character, bringing forth a certain feeling of disorientation as these unconsciously familiar symbols undergo transformation. The same sort of thing applies to your physical living. A dog may be a symbol to you of natural joy, for example, or of freedom. After seeing an accident in which a dog is killed, then dogs may mean something entirely different to you.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">当然这是个显而易见的例子，但类似的“象征的改变”也可能在梦中发生。就此而言，狗的意外可能是个梦里经验，然后，那事改变了你在醒时状态对狗的“象征意义”之有意识的感觉。一个人可能以恶魔、不友善的动物、甚或完全稀松平常的无害物体来象征恐惧；但如果你知道自己的象征意思何在，那么你不仅可用这知识来解梦，同时也可以把它当作路标，指出你已进入了它们常在其中发生的那种意识状态。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This of course is obvious, but the same sort of symbol changing may occur within dreams. The dog’s accident may be a dream experience, for that matter, that then changes your conscious symbolic feeling toward dogs in the waking state. One person may symbolize fear as a demon, as an unfriendly animal, or even as some perfectly simple ordinarily harmless object; but if you know what your own symbols mean, then you can use the knowledge not only to interpret your dreams but also as signposts to the state of consciousness in which they usually occur.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此，在不同的意识阶段，这些象征会变，而且这些改变并没有逻辑上的顺序。但直觉性的创造会改变象征，很相似于一个画家改变色彩的方式。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>These symbols will change, therefore, in various stages of consciousness. Again, the logical sequence is not present, but the intuitive creation will change the symbols much in the way that an artist might change his colors.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可以休息一会儿。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:44。在10:58以同样快速的步调继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:44. Resume at the same fast pace at 10:58.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此，所有的象征都代表着内在实相，而当你像耍球艺人那样把你的“象征”换来换去时，你是在玩耍、变换内在实相。任何你表现于外的行动，都是在内在环境、在所有你涉及的内在环境里造成的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>All symbols stand for inner realities, therefore, and when you juggle symbols, you are juggling inner realities. Any exterior move that you make is made within the interior environment, within all the interior environments with which you are involved.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">象征是充溢着情感和意义的心灵粒子，那也包括了那些有很强的吸引与扩张特性的物体，它们代表未由直接知晓(此地我所谓直接知晓，是指未经“象征化”的即刻认识与理解)所感知的内在实现与实相。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Symbols are highly charged psychic particles and that includes physical objects that have strong characteristics of attraction and expansion, that stand for inner realizations and realities that have not been perceived through direct knowing. (By direct knowing here, I mean instant cognition and comprehension, without symbolization.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那么，在意识的各个不同阶段，即使象征也会有不同的表现。有些寻求稳定和永久性，像你们的物体，遵循物质实相的原则或基本假设；而有些则变得快得多，像在梦境里，这些是对感受更即刻的、更敏感的指示。再次的，就如物体出现在物理环境中，意识的各个阶段似乎也有它们自己的环境，以供这些象征出现。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Even the symbols, then, at various stages of consciousness will appear differently, some seeking to have stability and permanence as your physical objects , following the principles or root assumptions of corporeal reality, and some changing much more quickly, as in the dream state, these being more immediate and sensitive indicators of feeling. Various states of consciousness seem to have their own environments in which these symbols appear, again, as objects appear in a physical environment.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">表面上看来非属稳定的“心理物体”，在某个层面的梦中环境出现。那么，在物质世界和梦境的两种情形里，象征都遵循法则。如我先前说过的；再说一次，梦的宇宙与物质宇宙是同样的“客观”，在其中的物体与象征，是梦中生活同样忠实的代表，就如物体之于醒时生活一样。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Seemingly nonstablemental objects appear in the dream environment at certain levels. The symbols follow rules then in both cases. As mentioned earlier, again, the dream universe is as “objective” as the corporeal one. The objects and symbols within it are as faithful representations of dream life as physical objects are of waking life.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此，“象征”的性质，不但可用来指示你所处的环境，也包括你在其中的意识状态。当你在一个梦剧的普通范围内正常的作梦时，梦中物体在你看来是恒常不变的，你视之为当然。你仍然是定向于肉体的。你把醒时的象征投射到梦的形象上。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The nature of the symbol, therefore, can serve as an indication not only as to your environment but your state of consciousness within it. In normal dreaming within the context of an ordinary dream drama, the objects seem permanent enough to you. You take them for granted. You are still physically oriented. You project upon dream images the symbolism of your waking hours.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(11:10)可是，在梦意识的其他状态里，房子可能突然消失，一幢现代的房子可能突然出现。在这个环境，“恒久不变”并非一个基本假设，逻辑性的顺序也不适用。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(11:10.) In other states of dream consciousness, however, houses may suddenly disappear. A modern building may suddenly replace a shack. A child may turn into a tulip. Now the symbols are obviously behaving in a different manner. In this environment, permanency is not a root assumption. Logical sequence does not apply.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">以这种方式运作的象征可以是你的线索，告诉你现在你在意识的另一个阶段，在一个全然不同的内在环境之内。感觉与经验不限于以“物体陷于顺序的时刻里”的呆板架构来表达。感觉自动地转换而以一种新的、流动的、即刻的方式表现。以某种方式而言，意识的调子加快了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Symbols that behave in this way can be clues to you that you are now at another stage of consciousness, and within an entirely different interior environment. Expression of feelings and of experiences are not limited to the rigid framework of objects stuck into consecutive moments. feelings are automatically transformed and expressed in a new, mobile, immediate manner. In a way the tune of consciousness is quicker.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">“实现”并不需要等几个小时或几天，经验也不受时间范畴的束缚。在意识的这个领域里，一刹那之间，一整本的书可以写好，或一个人一生的计划也可以透彻地被仔细审察。这特定的意识阶段是由许多次元组成的，而你们现在的时间即为其中之一。因而你的过去、现在与未来存在于它之内，但只是那内在环境的一部分而已。你必须学认路，因为意识的状态与它们的环境以自己的方式向外延伸，就像你的世界在空间里延伸。不过，经由在睡前给你自己适当的建议，并不难在这个阶段觉察你自己。(停顿。)口述完毕。我们有个好的开始……</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Actualization does not need to wait for hours or days. Experience is free from a time context. In this realm of consciousness an entire book may be written, or one’s life plans thoroughly scrutinized. Your present time is one of many dimensions that help form this particular stage of consciousness. Therefore your past, present and future exist within it, but only as portions of that interior environment. You have to learn your way about, for the states of consciousness and their environment stretch out in their own way as your world stretches out, say, in space. It is not difficult, however, to be aware of yourself in this stage through giving yourself proper suggestions before sleep. (Pause.) End of dictation. We have a good start….</details><br>
