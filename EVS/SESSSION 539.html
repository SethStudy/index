(在前天的课的结尾，珍告诉我赛斯已将第十章的余下部分计划好了。今晚，现在，她却说她一点都不知道赛斯将如何继续讲这一章。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(At the end of the last session, which was held the day before yesterday, Jane told me that Seth had the rest of Chapter Ten planned; tonight, now, she said she didn’t have the slightest idea of how Seth would continue his work on the chapter.</details>
(今天非常热而湿黏。暴风气候已酝酿了几小时，终于在九点左右开始下大雨，雷电交加。我们不知会不会上课，因为赛斯以前曾告诉我们闪电会干扰出神状态。但课却照常开始了；至少，赛斯显然没被打扰。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(The day had been very hot and sticky. Stormy weather had been building up for some hours. Finally it began to rain hard, with thunder and lightning, at about 9. We wondered whether a session would be held, since Seth had told us some time ago that electrical displays interfered with trance states. Yet the session began as usual; Seth, at least, was apparently not bothered.)</details>
现在：我们将继续口述。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: We will resume dictation.</details>
死后的环境现在就存在于你四周。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>After-death environments exist all about you, now. Period.</details>
你目前的情况及所有它的物理现象，就好像是由你们自己内部向外投射出来的一部连续放映的电影，强迫你只看到那些变换位置后的影像。它们看来那么真实，使你发现自己处于不断对它们反应的地位。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is as if your present situation and all its physical phenomena were projected from within yourself outward, giving you a continuous running motion picture, forcing you to perceive only those images that were being transposed. These seem so real that you find yourself in the position of reacting to them constantly.</details>
(在9:23停顿。到现在暴风雨是如此喧闹，以致赛斯提高了他的音量。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pause at 9:23. By now the storm was so noisy that Seth increased the volume of his voice.)</details>
可是这些形相被用来遮掩了其他同时存在十分有效的实相，并且你实际上是由这些其他实相获得运作这“物质投射”的力量与知识。你能“把机器停下来”，可以说，停止那明显的运动，而把注意力转向这些实相。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>They serve to mask other quite valid realities that exist at the same time, however, and actually from these other realities you gain the power and the knowledge to operate the material projections. You can “set the machine on idle,” so to speak, stop the apparent motion, and turn your attention to these realities.</details>
首先，你必须领悟它们是存在的。作为我以后将给的方法的初阶，你不妨不时问问自己：“在此时我实际上意识到什么？”当你眼睛睁开时这样做，当它们闭起来时也这样做。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>First of all, you must realize that they exist. As a preliminary to the methods I will give later, it is a good idea to ask yourself now and then: “What am I actually conscious of at this time?” Do this when your eyes open, and again when they are closed.</details>
当你的眼睛睁开时，不要视为当然只有即刻可见的物体存在。向好像空无一物的空处看，在无声当中倾听。在无物的空间里每一寸都有分子结构，但你教自己视而不见。还有其他的声音，但你已制约你的耳朵听而不闻。在梦境你用你的内在感官，而在醒时你忽略它们。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>When your eyes are open, do not take it for granted that only the immediately perceivable objects exist. Look where space seems empty, and listen in the middle of silence. There are molecular structures in every inch of empty space, but you have taught yourself not to perceive them. There are other voices, but you have conditioned your ears not to hear them. You use your inner senses when you are in the dream state, and ignore them when you are waking.</details>
(现在灯光暗了一两次。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Now the lights dimmed a couple of times.)</details>
内在感官是为感知非实质资料而准备的，它们不被你投射入三次元实相的影像所欺骗。其实，它们也能感知实质物体。你的肉体感官是这些内在感知方法的延伸，在死后你就得依赖它们了。你在“出体”经验中用到它们。它们继续不断的在醒时意识下面运作。……<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The inner senses are equipped to perceive data that is not physical. They are not deceived by the images that you project in three-dimensional reality. Now, they can perceive physical objects . Your physical senses are extensions of these inner methods of perception, and after death it is upon these that you will rely. They are used in out-of-body experiences. They operate constantly beneath normal waking consciousness…</details>
(风雨大作之后，在我们这区发生了意外或火灾或两者皆有。几辆警笛尖鸣的汽车与卡车疾驰过两户之外的华纳街。我以为所有这些喧嚷会打破珍的出神状态，但并没有；她停了几分钟，又继续了。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(There had been an accident, or fire, or both in our section of the city after the storm broke loose. With sirens screeching several cars and trucks sped past on Walnut Street, two doors away. I expected all the racket to break Jane’s trance, but it didn’t; she paused for a few moments and then continued.)</details>
因此你甚至能对死后的知觉本质变得熟悉起来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>… so that you can even become familiar with the nature of perception after death, now. Period.</details>
换言之，其环境、状况和感知的方法并不陌生。你不是突然被抛进“未知”之中；那“未知”现在即为你的一部分。在这肉体出生前它就是你的一部分，肉体死后也是一样。可是，一般而言，有史以来这些状况大体上都从你的意识中被抹除了。人类对自己的实相曾有各种不同的观念，但在上个世纪他似乎故意别过脸去不予理睬。这有很多理由，我们将试着谈谈其中的一些。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In other words, the environment, conditions, and methods of perception will not be alien. You are not suddenly thrust into an unknown; that unknown is a part of you now. It was a part of you before this physical birth, and will be after physical death. These conditions, however, have been blotted out of your consciousness in the main, throughout physical history. Mankind has had various conceptions of his own reality but he has purposely, it seems, turned away from it in the last century. There are many reasons for this, and we will try to cover some of them.</details>
休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Take your break.</details>
(9:37，照开始的时间来说，休息来得很早。珍说：“情形不安定，我几次受到打扰。”她特别知觉到警笛声。她说她的出神状态是“悸动着”或如波浪般；她会进去很深，然后摆荡到接近她平常的意识状态。但就我所知，资料仍是一样的好，她讲话的方式也没改变。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:37. Break came early, considering the time the session began. “Things are unsettled,” Jane said. “I was bothered at times.” She had been aware of the sirens especially. She said her trance had been “pulsating” or wavelike: she would go “in” good, and then swing up closer to her usual state of consciousness. Yet as far as I could tell the material was as good as ever, the manner of her delivery unchanged.</details>
(雨、雷、电不减弱地持续着，噪音在全城来回喧嚣。那暴风雨激烈到甚至这么坚固的大房子有时也会震动。9:52，当珍再继续时，她的声音比平时更大了，虽然步调较缓慢。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(The rain, thunder and lightning continued unabated, the noise racketing back and forth over the city. It was the kind of a storm in which even this big and solid house shook at times. Jane’s voice was still stronger than usual when she resumed, though at a slower pace, at 9:52.)</details>
于是在许多方面来说，你现在就是“死的”——与你将来所可能的一样的死。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In many ways then, you are “dead” now ---- and as dead as you will ever be.</details>
在你忙于日常的杂务与营生时，在你正常的醒时意识下面，你也经常聚焦于其他的实相，对你肉体的、有意识的自己并不觉察的刺激反应，以内在感官来感知情况，并体验那些在肉身的大脑里甚至没有记录的事件。最后部分应全部划线。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>While you go about your daily chores and endeavors, beneath normal waking consciousness you are constantly focused in other realities also, reacting to stimuli of which your physical conscious self is not aware, perceiving conditions through the inner senses, and experiencing events that are not even registered within the physical brain. That whole last portion should be underlined.</details>
在死后，你只不过是知觉到你现在忽略的这些活动次元。现在，肉体生活占了上风。到那时，它就不会了。可是，你也不会失掉它；例如，你会保留你的记忆。你只是跨出了某一个特定的参考架构。在某种情形下，你甚至可以不同方式自由运用那似乎给予你的岁月。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>After death you are simply aware of these dimensions of activity that you now ignore. Now, physical existence predominates. Then, it will not. Nor, however, will it be lost to you; your memories, for example, will be retained. You will simply step out of a particular framework of reference. Under certain conditions you will even be free to use the years seemingly given to you in different ways.</details>
(10:01)举例来说：我告诉过你，时间并不是由一连串一个接着另一个的“片刻”所组成，虽然你现在是以那种方式感知它。事件也不是发生在你身上的事，它们是你按照自己的期望与信念造成的具体化了的经验。现在你人格的内在部分就知道此点。死后你不再聚焦于受时间和事件影响的物质形相。你可用同样的时间与事件为原料，像画家用颜色一样。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:01.) For example: I told you time does not consist of a series of moments, one before the other, though you do perceive it now in that fashion. Events are not things that happen to you. They are materialized experiences formed by you according to your expectations and beliefs. Inner portions of your personality realize this now. After death you will not concentrate upon the physical forms taken by time and events. You may use the same elements, as a painter might use his colors.</details>
(10:07。我们现在正下着一场非常历害的大雨。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:07. We were now having a very heavy, hard rain.)</details>
也许你的命有77年那么长，死后在某种情况下，如果你选择如此，你可以不慌不忙地经验那77年中的事件——却不一定是前后相续的。你可以改变那些事件。你可在代表你77年岁月的特定活动次元中操作。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Perhaps your life span runs for seventy-seven years. After death you may, under certain conditions and if you choose, experience the events of those seventy-seven years at your leisure ---- but not necessarily in terms of continuity. You may alter the events. You can manipulate within that particular dimension of activity that represented your seventy-seven years.</details>
如果你发现严重的错误判断，你那时便可以改正它们。换言之，你可使之完美，但你不能以一个完全参与的意识再进入那参考架构中，随着，好比说，当时的历史潮流而加入那群体幻构出的存在——你自己与你“同代的人”应用意识的结果。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>If you find severe errors of judgment, you may then correct them. You may perfect, in other words, but you cannot again enter into that frame of reference as a completely participating consciousness following, say, the historic trends of the time, joining into the mass-hallucinated existence that resulted from the applied consciousness of your self and your “contemporaries.”</details>
有些人宁选这个而非转生，或更正确的说，把它当作在新的转世之前的一种研究。这些人常常内心是个完美主义者，他们必须回去再创造，他们必须纠正他们的错误。他们用最近一次的前生作为一张画布，用相同的“画布”试着画一张较好的画。这是许多人在从事的精神与心灵上的练习，需要全神贯注，而并不比任何的存在更为虚幻。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Some choose this rather than reincarnating, or rather as a study before a new reincarnation. These people are often perfectionists at heart. They must go back and create. They must right their errors. They use the immediately-past life as a canvas, and with the same “canvas,” they attempt a better picture. This is amental and psychic exercise, undertaken by many, demanding great concentration, and is no more hallucinatory than any existence.</details>
现在你可以休息。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take your break.</details>
(10:14。珍的出神状态比刚才还要深，但她对只讲了这么短的时间感到惊奇；她以为她已出去较久了。到现在雨开始减弱了一些，天气也稍凉了些。她说：“今晚仍是个奇怪的晚上。”在10:31继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:14. Jane’s trance had been deeper, but she was surprised at the short delivery; she thought she had been out for a longer time. The rain had tapered off somewhat by now, and it was cooler. “It’s still a strange night,” she said. Resume at 10:31.)</details>
你可能觉得你想“重温”生活中的某些旧梦，以便更了解它们。你的生活经验是为你自己所有的。这种旧梦重温无疑地并不陌生，在日常生活中，你也常常想象自己曾以一种不同的态度做某件事，或在你心里重新玩味一些事以获得更多的了解。你的生活是你个人的“经验——看法”，而在死亡时你把它由群体的地球时间脉络里拿了出来，那时你便能以许多方式来体验它。要记住，事件与物体不是绝对的而是可塑的。在事件发生之前与后，它们都可被改变，它们从来不是安定或永久性的，即使在三次元的实相中它们可能看来如此。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may feel that you want to “relive” certain episodes of your life so that you can understand them better. Your life’s experience, therefore, is your own. Such conditions certainly are not alien. In ordinary living, you often imagine yourself behaving in a different manner than you did, or in your mind reexperiencing events in order to gain greater understanding from them. Your life is your own personal experience- perspective, and when at death you take it out of the mass physical time context, then you can experience it in many ways. Events and objects are not absolute, remember, but plastic. Events can be changed both before and after their occurrence. They are never stable or permanent, even though within the context of three-dimensional reality they may appear so.</details>
任何你在三次元存在中所知觉的事，只是一个更大的实相在那次元中的投射。你所意识到的事件，只是那些活动的片段侵入或出现在你的正常醒时意识而已。在梦境及在白天醒时意识之底层，你对这些事件的其他部分是相当清楚的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Anything of which you are aware in three-dimensional existence is only a projection of a greater reality into that dimension. The events of which you are conscious are only those fragments of activities that intrude or appear to your normal waking consciousness. Other portions of these events are quite clear to you both in the dreaming state and beneath waking consciousness during the day.</details>
(10:42。珍的步调现在是相当的慢。)如果你想知道死亡像什么，那么你就要开始觉察，当自己的意识离开世间的活动时，它是个什么样子，你会发现它是极活跃的。常常这样做之后，你会发现你的正常醒时意识是非常有限的，而你一度认为是“死的”情况，似乎更像是“活的”情况了。口述完毕。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:42. Jane’s pace was quite slow.) If you want to know what death is like, then become aware of your own consciousness as it is divorced from physical activities. You will find that it is highly active. With practice you will discover that your normal waking consciousness is highly limited, and that what you thought of once as death conditions seem much more like life conditions. End of dictation.</details>
今晚由于大气的影响，情况有一些不稳定，但我们无论如何还是上了课。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now there is some instability this evening, resulting from the atmosphere, but we held the session in any case.</details>
(“我认为今晚的课很好。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“I thought it was good.”)</details>
不过，我们还是结束吧。在这种情况下对鲁柏有额外的压力，没有必要延长它。祝晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We will end it, however. There is some additional strain on Ruburt in such circumstances, and there is no need prolonging it. A fond good evening.</details>
(“也祝你晚安，赛斯。”10:46。珍说她觉得没事。虽然她的出神状态今晚多少有些变化，她真正感到的唯一“额外压力”，是在休息后有些难以回到出神状态。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“The same to you, Seth.” 10:46. Jane said she felt all right. Although her trances had varied somewhat tonight, the only “additional strain” she’d been aware of, really, was some trouble going back into trance after breaks.</details>
(后来我们谈论珍最近的想法——如果每日上课一连六天，看看赛斯在如此武断订出的一段时期中能将他的书完成多少。看到书的一部分以那种方式产生会是很有趣的。不过，这想法从没实现过，虽则在三月里当在进行第三章时，赛斯已表示过他愿意试试这样办。见第519节中、10:30的休息时的注，以及赛斯接下去所说的话。珍在3月30日的第521节后就不看这本书。现在是7月1日了。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Afterwards we talked over Jane’s recent idea ---- to holding, say, a session per day for six consecutive days, to see how much Seth would get done on the book in such an arbitrary period. It would be interesting to see part of it produced that way. The idea never materialized, however, even though Seth had expressed his willingness to try something like this back in March, when Chapter Three was underway. See the notes for the 10:31 break in the 519th session, and Seth’s subsequent remarks. Jane stopped looking at the book in the 521st session for March 30; it’s now July 1.)</details>
