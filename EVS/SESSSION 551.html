现在，晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now, good evening.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
我们继续口述。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We will resume dictation.</details>
在每一生中，你应该检查外在的环境以便习知你内在的情形。外在即内在的一个反映。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>In each life you are meant to check the exterior environment in order to learn your inner condition. The outer is a reflection of the inner.</details>
你应了解你内我的天性，而表之于外。当你做到了这个，当内我对自己的天性和能力变得比较明了时，外在环境应会好转。那么，理论上说，在每一生你会变得更坚强、更健康、更富有、更聪明，但为了许多理由，事实上却并非如此。如我以前说过的，许多人格采取了各种不同的经验，也许在一连串的转生中都专注于某个特定区域的发展，而忽略了其他的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You are meant to understand the nature of your inner self, and to manifest it outward. As this is done, the exterior circumstances should change for the better as the inner self becomes more aware of its own nature and capabilities. Theoretically, then, in each life you would become stronger, healthier, wealthier, and wiser, but it does not work that way, for many reasons. As mentioned earlier, many personalities adopt different kinds of experiences, focusing upon development in certain specific areas, and ignoring others perhaps for a series of lives.</details>
并没有意识会有相同的经验或给它同样的诠释，因此每个人各以自己的方式利用转世的机会。比如说，性别的改变是必要的。有些人在每一生都改变性别。其他人则有一串的女性生活，然后一串的男性生活，或反过来。但全部的转世架构一定要涉及两种性别的经验。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>No consciousness has the same experiences or interprets them the same, and so each individual utilizes reincarnational opportunities in his own way. Sex changes, for example, are necessary. Some individuals alternate their sex in each (succeeding) life. Others have a series of female lives and then a series of male lives, or vice versa, but the entire reincarnational framework must involve both sexual experiences.</details>
若遵循一个“单一性别”的路线，能力无法得到发展。一定要有为母与为父的经验。当你到达那一点，即当你悟到你在形成你日复一日的存在以及你所知的生活时，你才能开始改变自己精神上与心灵上的模式，因而改变你的日常环境。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Abilities cannot be developed following a one-sex line. There must be experiences in motherhood and fatherhood. When you get to the point that you realize you are forming your day-to-day existence and the life that you know, then you can begin to alter your ownmental and psychic patterns, and therefore change your daily environment.</details>
(9:25)不过，这个领悟，应与一个对内我能力的深刻直觉知识齐头并进。这两个因素在一起，能把你从任何由前生而来的困难中解脱出来。你人生的整个结构将随这些领悟而开始改变，发展出精神上与心灵上的加速成长。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:25.) This realization, however, should go hand in hand with a deep intuitional knowledge of the capabilities of the inner self. These two factors together can release you from any difficulties that have arisen in past lives. The entire structure of your existence will begin to change with these realizations, and an acceleration of spiritual and psychic growth will develop.</details>
就你现今的人际关系、心态与经验而言，都有一个内在的逻辑。比如说，如果在某一生中你恨女人，很可能在下一生你就是个女人。你明白吗？只有以这方式你才能体会做女人的经验，然后做为一个女人去面对那些你过去所有反对女人的态度。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There is an inner logic to your current relationships, attitudes, and experiences. If in one life, for example, you Hated women, you may very well be a woman in the next life. Only in this way, you see, would you be able to relate to the experience of womanhood, and then as a woman face those attitudes that you yourself had against women in the past.</details>
如果过去对病人没有同情心，那么你可能带着重病出生，也是你自己选择的，于是你发现自己遭遇到那些一度为你自己所有的态度。不过，这样的一个人生，通常也还会包括其他的课题。没有哪个人生是只为一个理由而选择的，它也会提供许多其他的心理经验。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>If you had no sympathy for the sick, you may then be born with a serious disease, again now self-chosen, and find yourself encountering those attitudes that once were your own. Such an existence would usually also include other issues, however. No existence is chosen for one reason only, but would also serve many other psychological experiences.</details>
举例来说，患慢性病的一生可能也是一种磨炼方法，使你能用到你在健康良好的一生中所忽略的更深能力。比如说，完美快乐的一生，在表面上也许显得极好，但它也可能基本上是浅薄的，对发展人格无甚助益。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>A chronically ill existence, for example, might also be a measure of discipline, enabling you to use deeper abilities that you ignored in a life of good health. The perfectly happy life for example, on the surface, may appear splendid, but it may also be basically shallow and do little to develop the personality.</details>
可是，真正快乐的一生是深深令人满足的，应该会包含了自发的智慧与心灵的喜悦。换言之，我不是说受苦必然会导致精神上的成就，所有的病痛也不是只为这样一个目的而被选择和接受的，因为事实并非如此。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The truly happy existence, however, is a deeply satisfying one that would include spontaneous wisdom and spiritual joy. I am not saying, in other words, that suffering necessarily leads to spiritual fulfillment, nor that all illness is accepted or chosen for such a purpose, for this is not the case.</details>
(9:35)疾病常常是无知和懒惰的精神习惯的结果。但是某种因其他的特性而必须对自己采取强烈手段的人，可能采用这样的训练。在生生世世中有一个整体的人际关系模式。然而这并不指你与同样有限的、熟悉的几个朋友去经历各个不同的人生，只是像换上了不同的面孔或服饰的演员一样。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:35.) Illness is often the result of ignorance and lazy mental habits. Such a discipline may be adopted however by certain personalities who must take strong measures with themselves because of other characteristics. There is an overall pattern to relationships within lives, and yet this does not mean that you travel through various existences with the same limited and familiar number of friends and acquaintances, merely altered like actors with a change of face or costume.</details>
一群人在各生中为了某种目的而相聚又分离，也许会也许不会在一个不同的时地再聚。但是，再次的，这并没有固定的规则。有些家庭真的是他们祖先的转世，但这绝非惯例。深刻的关系多少会继续，而其他的就消失了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Groups of individuals come together in various lives for certain purposes, separate, and may or may not come together again in a different time or place. Again, however, there is no rigid rule. Some families are literally reincarnations of their ancestors, but this is not the general case by any means. Deep relationships will continue in one way or another. Others will simply disappear.</details>
我要表明的一点是：发展与求知的机会在这一生、这一刻就存在，就像将来也会有一样。如果你现在忽略了日复一日的发展机会，没有人能在你死后或两生之间强迫你接受并利用更多的能力。在死后经验中有老师在那儿，但在你现在的存在里，老师也在那儿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The point I want to make is that the opportunity for development and knowledge is as present at this moment, in this life, as it will ever be. If you ignore day-by-day opportunities for development now, no one can force you to accept and utilize greater abilities after death, or between lives. The teachers are there in after-death experience, but there are also teachers here in your existence now.</details>
有些家庭在某个特定的一世里相聚，并非因为在一个过去的存在中有很大的吸引力或爱，却是为了相反的理由。那么，家庭可能由过去不喜欢彼此的个人所组成，以密切的关系相聚，再为了一个共同目的而一同努力，学着更了解彼此，而在一个不同的情形下把问题解决。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Some families come together in a particular life not because of great attraction or love in a past existence, but for the opposite reason. Families may be composed, then, of individuals who disliked each other in the past and come together in a close relationship where they are to work together toward a common goal, learn to understand each other better, and work out problems in a different kind of context.</details>
每一代有其共同的目的。就是这个——使内在知识完美，使它尽可能忠实地向外具体化到这世界。世代以来如你们所知的具体景象的改变，代表在各个不同的时期里活在世上的每个人内心中闪现过的内在形象。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Jointly, each generation has its own purpose. It is this ---- to perfect inner knowledge, and to materialize it as faithfully as possible outward into the world. The changing physical scene throughout the centuries, as you know them, represents the inner images that have flickered through the minds of the individuals who lived within the world through the various ages.</details>
现在你可以休息一会儿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take your break.</details>
(9:48。珍讲得一直很快，但即使如此，她说她的出神状态不如平常那样深。在我们公寓外的通道上，人来人往的声音干扰到她。通常她不会注意到像这样的事。在10:05继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:48. Jane’s delivery had been fast but even so, she said, her trance hadn’t been as deep as it usually is. She had been bothered by the sounds of people walking back and forth in the hallway outside our apartment. Ordinarily she wouldn’t have noticed anything like this. Resume at 10:05.)</details>
你没必要知道自己的前世，虽然如果你了解这次你选择了你诞生的环境也许有益。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: It is not necessary that you learn about your own past lives, though it may be helpful if you understand that you chose the circumstances of your birth this time.</details>
如果你现在仔细地检查自己的生活，你为你自己设下的挑战会变得很明显。这不很容易做，却是每个人都能做到的。如果你把自己由怨恨中释放出来，那么你便自动地把自己由将来任何的这类关系——或任何根植于怨恨的经验——中释放出来。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>If you examine your own life now carefully, the challenges that you have set for yourself will become apparent. This is not easy to do, but it is within the grasp of each individual. If you release yourself from Hatred, then you automatically release yourself from any such relationships in the future ---- or any experiences that are based upon Hatred.</details>
知道你的转世背景，却不知现在你的真正天性是没有用的。你不能说：“这是因为我前生所做的事。”而使目前的环境合理化，因为现在在你内心你就有改变负面影响的能力。你可能为了某种理由而把负面的影响带入你的生活，但这理由永远与了解有关系，而了解移开了那些影响。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Knowing your reincarnational background, but not knowing the true nature of your present self, is useless. You cannot justify or rationalize present circumstances by saying, “This is because of something I did in a past life,” for within yourself now is the ability to change negative influences. You may have brought negative influences into your life for a given reason, but the reason always has to do with understanding, and understanding removes those influences.</details>
你不能说：“穷人之所以穷，只因他们选择了贫困，因此我不必去帮助他们。”这种态度很容易在你下一次的经验中使你吸引到贫困。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You cannot say, “The poor are poor simply because they chose poverty, and therefore there is no need for me to help them.” This attitude can easily draw poverty to you in the next experience.</details>
(10:13。再一次的，当我们的猫威立跳入她怀里，珍的出神状态被打断了。我再一次地把它放进壁橱里，同时珍给我一个无可奈何的眼色。事实上威立不常打扰我们；但我现在心中暗自记住以后我们要回到我们的老法子，在课前把它放在另一间屋里。当1963年这些课开始时，威立曾惯于有强烈的反应。在10:15继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:13. Once again Jane’s trance was broken when our cat, Willy, jumped up into her lap. Once more I put him in the closet while Jane gave me an “oh, well” look. Actually Willy doesn’t interrupt us very often; but now I made amental note that after this we’d go back to our old routine, and put him in another room before session time. Willy used to react strongly to these sessions when they began in 1963. Resume at 10:15.)</details>
即使在转世轮回结束时，每个人的成就也不一样。有些人拥有某种特质，那是在人类经验中找不到可以类比的。对各种不同的人，人世生活本身也有不同的效果。有些人发现“人生”是极佳的表达与发展的媒介，对他们很合适。他们有技巧以具体的方式表达自己，把内在感觉忠实地客观化。别的人觉得很难，但就是这些人可能在其他层面的实相里做得好得多。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Each individual is not at the same level of achievement even at the end of the reincarnational cycle. Some possess certain qualities that do not find a counterpart within human experience. Physical existence itself has a different effect upon various individuals. Some find it an excellent medium of expression and development. They are suited to it. They have the knack for expressing themselves in physical ways and objectifying inner feelings faithfully. Others find this difficult, and yet these same individuals may do much better in other levels of reality.</details>
有些“坚韧的灵魂”在物质实相中活得健旺，而他们可能有困难适应其他非物质的活动区域。可是，在所有这些区域，深刻的心灵上或情感上的情况永不会被否定。在往世中很密切的朋友，如果他处在能这样做的情况，当你在梦境时会常常与你沟通，而你们的关系仍在继续，虽然你意识上不觉得。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There are “hardy souls” who thrive in physical reality, and who may have difficulties acclimating to other nonphysical areas of activity. In all of these areas, however, deep spiritual or emotional contexts are never negated. Very close friends from past lives, who are in a position to do so, often communicate with you when you are in the dream state, and the relationships are continued though you do not realize it consciously.</details>
在一个无意识的基础上，你会知觉你过去认识的一个人转世为人。当然，你在梦中所遇见的陌生人，也往往是你在前世中已认识、现在活着的人。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>On an unconscious basis, you are aware of the birth into physical life of someone you have known in the past. The strangers that you meet in your dreams are often, of course, people now alive ---- contemporaries ---- that you have also known in past lives.</details>
也有短暂的关系，接触了，然后作罢了。例如，任一生的配偶，也许代表或也许不代表某个与你有过很深的历久不渝关系的人，你也同样可能因前生极暧昧的感觉而与某人结婚，选择了一个不建立于爱上的婚姻关系，虽然爱可能会出现。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There are also passing relationships, contacts made and then dropped. A mate from any given life, for example, may or may not represent someone with whom you have a deep abiding tie, and again you may marry someone because of highly ambiguous feelings from a past life, and choose a married relationship that is not based upon love, though love may emerge.</details>
附带地说，双生子几乎永远涉及了一个具有极强烈——有时是执迷的——性质历久不渝的心灵关系。我现在说的是同卵双生子。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Twins, incidentally, almost always involve very deep, abiding psychic relationships of a strong, sometimes obsessive nature. I am speaking now of identical twins.</details>
我建议你休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I suggest your break.</details>
(10:29。显然今晚不怎么顺，珍再一次在回过神来时说，她知觉到在我们客厅门外的往复脚步声。我曾希望她这次的出神状态深些。在10:37继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:29. This evidently wasn’t our night. Again, Jane said upon coming out of trance, she had been aware of the footsteps of people passing back and forth in the hall outside our living room door. I had been hoping her trance was deeper this time. Resume at 10:37.)</details>
转世的目的也有很大的不同。我要强调转世是人所用的工具，他们每个人按自己的方式用它。有些人喜欢做女人，或对男人的生活更喜爱。虽然两者都必须经过，但仍有很大的选择与活动的范围。有些人在某一方面会有困难，而在其他方面相当轻松地发展。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>reincarnational goals also vary greatly. I want to stress that reincarnation is a tool used by personalities. They each use it in their own way. Some enjoy female existences, or have greater fondness for male lives. While both must be encountered, there is a great range of choice and activity. Some personalities will have difficulties along certain lines, and develop with relative ease in other ways.</details>
因为挑战与环境是由人选择的，所以绝不涉及命定(predetermination)。举例来说，有些问题可能被延缓好几生。有些人则想要解决他们最严重的那些问题，也许在一系列相当折磨人的人生和夸张的环境里，把它们解决掉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Predetermination is never involved, for the challenge and circumstances are chosen. Some problems may be put off, for example, for several existences. Some personalities want to solve their strongest problems and get them over with, perhaps in a series of rather trying existences and exaggerated circumstances.</details>
其他性情比较沉着的人则一次解决一个问题。也许中间还休息一段时间，这是非常有治疗作用的。例如，一个人可能选择一次问题极少、极美好的、令人满足的一生，当作是集中了所有挑战的一生的前奏，或是为了补偿前一世的困苦，自己给自己的一种报酬。然而，那些彻底享受物质媒介而不为之所迷的人的确是做得很好。转世的“法则”是个人随他的需要而加以改编的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Others of a more placid nature will take their problems one at a time. Rest periods may also be taken, and they are highly therapeutic. For example, an excellent, satisfying life with a minimum of problems may be chosen either as a prelude to a life of concentrated challenge or as a self-adopted reward for a previous difficult life. Those that thoroughly enjoy the physical medium, without being obsessed by it, however, do very well indeed. The “laws” of reincarnation are adapted by the individual personalities to suit themselves.</details>
我建议结束此节，除非你有问题。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I suggest that we end our session unless you have questions.</details>
(“没有。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“No.”)</details>
我最衷心的问候。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My heartiest regards.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good night, Seth.”</details>
(10:47。珍的出神状态后来终于改进了。她说：“我刚开始感觉我在进入一个更深的境界，至少我什么都不觉得——但现在全完了……”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:47 P.M. At last, Jane’s trance had improved. “I was just beginning to feel that I was getting into a deeper state,” she said. “At least I wasn’t aware of anything ---- but now it’s all over….”)</details>
