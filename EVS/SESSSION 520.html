<div style="display:inline">(就我们所知，赛斯今晚会继续口述第三章。在开始前的一、两分钟，珍告诉我她由赛斯那儿得到了一丝灵感——几个句子。她说：“然后我就准备等课开始了。但我仍无法告诉你，我到底是怎么做的。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(As far as we knew, Seth would resume dictation on Chapter Three of his book this evening. A minute or two before the session began Jane told me that she had a “glimmer” from Seth ---- a few sentences. “Then,” she said, “I settle down and wait for the session to start. But I still can’t tell you just how I do it.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">回到我们的书。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Back to our book.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(间或停顿。)你们的科学家终于学到了哲学家世代以来已知的事——既“心”能影响“物”。他们仍需发现心创造及形成物这个事实。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(With pauses): Your scientists are finally learning what philosophers have known for centuries ---- that mind can influence matter. They still have to discover the fact that mind creates and forms matter.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在，实质地说，你最切身的环境就是你的身体。它并不像是你被囚禁其中的某种人体解剖模型，像个壳子似地与你分开地存在。你身体的美或丑、健康或残障、敏捷或迟缓，并不是在你出生时就无所选择地强加了给你。相反的，你的体型、你具体的个人环境，是你自己的思想、情感与诠释的物质具体化。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now your closest environment, physically speaking, is your body. It is not like some manikin-shape in which you are imprisoned, that exists apart from you like a casing. Your body is not beautiful or ugly, healthy or deformed, swift or slow simply because this is the kind of body that was thrust upon you indiscriminately at birth. Instead your physical form, your corporeal personal environment, is the physical materiaization of your own thoughts, emotions, and interpretations.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">非常确实地，“内我”(inner self)神奇地把思想与情感转变为物质的对等物，因而形成了肉体。是你在栽培肉体，它的情形十足反映出任何时候你的主观情况。你用原子和分子建造你的肉体，将基本元素造成一个你称为“自己”的形体。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Quite literally, the “inner self” forms the body by magically transforming thoughts and feelings into physical counterparts. You grow the body. Its condition perfectly mirrors your subjective state at any given time. Using atoms and molecules, you build your body, forming basic elements into a form that you call your own.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你直觉地知道你形成自己的形象，而且你独立于它之外，但你却不知道，借着推进你的思想与情感成为物质——突破进入三度空间的生活——你创造了你更大的环境及你所知的物质世界。因此，内我独自又集体地放出它的心灵能量，形成触须而合生(coalesce)为形体。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You are intuitively aware that you form your image, and that you are independent of it. You do not realize that you create your larger environment and the physical world as you know it by propelling your thoughts and feelings into matter ---- a breakthrough into three-dimensional life. The inner self, therefore, individually and en masse, sends its psychic energy out, forming tentacles that coalesce into form.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:23。)每一情感与思想都有其自己的电磁性实相，完全的独一无二。它天生就可以按照你想包括的种种不同强度，与某些其他的情感与思想结合，以某种方式来说，三度空间物体的形成方式有点像你在电视荧幕上所见影像的形成方式，但两者间有一个很大的不同。而如果你没调准到那特定频率，你将完全看不见那物体。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:23.) Each emotion and thought has its own electromagnetic reality, completely unique. It is highly equipped to combine with certain others, according to the various ranges of intensity that you may include. In a manner of speaking, three-dimensional objects are formed in somewhat the same way that the images you see on your television screen are formed, but with a large difference. And if you are not tuned into that particular frequency, you will not perceive the physical objects at all.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(身为赛斯，珍在说话时身向前倾以便强调。今晚她的传递略有不同，我想她是对我们自己的环境反应。声音似乎由我们上方与下方传来。珍会说一句话，然后比平时要中断得久些，因此她惯常的节拍有点变了。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(As Seth, Jane leaned forward for emphasis while speaking. Her delivery was somewhat different this evening. I thought she was reacting to our own environment. Sounds seemed to carry through above and below us. Jane would deliver a sentence, then pause longer than usual, so that her accustomed rhythm was a little off.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们每个人都无意识地扮演着“变压器”的角色，自动地把非常复杂精密(sophisticated)的电磁单位转变成实物。你们正在“物质密集的系统”(matter-concentrated system)的中央，被较弱的地区所环绕，在那些区域里你可称为“假物质”(pseudomatter)的东西仍继续存在。每一思想与情感自发地以单一或复杂的电磁单位存在——附带地说，你们的科学家尚未感知此点。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Each of you act as transformers, unconsciously, automatically transforming highly sophisticated electromagnetic units into physical objects . You are in the middle of a “matter-concentrated system,” surrounded, so to speak, by weaker areas in which what you would call “pseudomatter” persists. Each thought and emotion spontaneously exists as a simple or complex electromagnetic unit ---- unperceived, incidentally, as yet by your scientists.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:27。)一个思想或情感的电磁强度决定要具体化的物质形象的力量与永久性。在我自己的资料中，我详细地解释此点。此地，我只要你们了解你们所知的世界是一个内在实相的反映。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:27.) The intensity determines both the strength and the permanency of the physical image into which the thought or emotion will be materialized. In my own material I am explaining this in depth. Here, I merely want you to understand that the world that you know is the reflection of an inner reality.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">基本上你们是由与椅子、石头、生菜、小鸟同样的原料所造成的。在一个庞大的合作性努力里，所有的意识合力造成你们所知觉的形相。现在，因为这点为我们所知，我们乃能随意改变我们的环境与我们的物质形相而不会造成混乱，因为我们知觉其背后的实情。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You are made basically of the same ingredients as a chair, a stone, a head of lettuce, a bird. In a gigantic cooperative endeavor, all consciousness joins together to make the forms that you perceive. Now, because this is known to us, we can change our environments and our own physical forms as we wish, and without confusion, for we perceive the reality that lies beneath.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我们也体认到形相之永久性是个幻觉，既然所有的意识必然是在一种变化的状况。在你们来说，我们可以同时在几个地方，因为我们了悟意识的真正机动性。且说不论何时，当你带着感情想到另一个人时，你就送出了一个你的对等物(counterpart)，其强度在物质之下，但却是一个明确的形相。这形相由你自己的意识向外投射，完全避过了你的自我的注意。当我带感情的想到某人，我也在做同样的事，只除了我的意识的一部分是在那形象之内，而且能与人沟通。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>We also realize that permanency of form is an illusion , since all consciousness must be in a state of change. We can be, in your terms, in several places at once because we realize the true mobility of consciousness. Now whenever you think emotionally of another person, you send out a counterpart of yourself, beneath the intensity of matter, but a definite form. This form, projecting outward from your own consciousness, completely escapes your egotistical attention. When I think emotionally of someone else, I do the same thing, except that a portion of my consciousness is within the image, and can communicate.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可以休息。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:37。珍很快地回神。屋中的噪音仍继续着。刚才在她传递时曾受到干扰，我的笔记也受干扰。尽管如此，她仍很惊奇居然已快过了半个小时。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:37. Jane was out of her trance quickly. The noises in the house continued. She had been bothered by them during her delivery, and they had interfered with my note taking. Nevertheless, she was surprised that almost half an hour had passed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(然而，在9:56她坐着等待回到出神状态时，珍说：“不是今晚我太累，就是这房子让我受不了，但现在较难开始……”在9:58继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(At 9:56, though, as she sat waiting to go back into trance, Jane said, “Either I’m tired tonight, or the house is getting to me, but now it’s harder to get going….” Resume at 9:58.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">环境主要是意识向外推挤而形成的各种形式的精神性创造。例如，我有一个我偏爱的十四世纪的书房，我对它非常满意。以你们实质的说法，它并不存在，而我十分明白它是我的精神产品。我却很享受它，并且我常常采取一个具体形相以便坐在桌旁，而由窗子看外面的乡间景色。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Environments are primarilymental creations of consciousness thrust out into many forms. I have a fourteenth-century study, my favorite, with which I am very pleased, for example. In your physical terms it does not exist, and I know quite well it is mymental production. Yet I enjoy it, and often take a physical form in order to sit at the desk and look out the window at the countryside.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在当你坐在你的起居室里，你也在做同样的事，但你却不明白你在做什么；目前你多少受到限制。当我与我的同事们相会，我们常把彼此的思想转译为种种不同的形状与形相，单纯只为了喜欢这样做。我们有一种你们所谓的游戏的作法，它需要一些专门技术，在那游戏里，我们看我们哪一个能把某一思想转译为最多的形相，而以之自娱。(停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now you do the same thing when you sit in your living room, but you do not realize what you are doing; and presently you are somewhat restricted. When my associates and I meet, we often translate each other’s thoughts into various shapes and forms out of pure enjoyment in the practice. We have what you might call a game, demanding some expertise, where for our own amusement we see which of us can translate any given thought into the most numerous forms. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">有如此精微的特质、如此不同层次的情感在影响所有思想的本质，以致于没有一个思想是完全相同的——(微笑：)顺带地说，在你们系统内的实物也没有一个是另一个完全相同的副本。组成它——任何物体——的原子和分子有其自己的本质，从而濡染并修饰了它们所形成的任何形象。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There are such subtle qualities affecting the nature of all thought, such emotional gradations, that no one is ever identical ---- (smile) and incidentally, no physical object in your system is an exact duplicate of any other. The atoms and molecules that compose it ---- any object ---- have their own identities that color and qualify any object that they form.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在你感知任何实物时，你接受、感知并集中在其持续性与相似性上，以非常重要的方式，你对某个现实场域(field of actuality)中的不同点予以封杀与忽略。因此，你有高度的分别心，你接受某些特质，而忽略另一些。例如，你的身体不仅是七年就完全改变一次，它们更随着每次呼吸而不断地改变。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You accept and perceive and focus upon continuities and similarities as you perceive physical objects of any kind, and in a very important manner you shut out and ignore dissimilarities out of a given field of actuality. Therefore you are very highly discriminating, accepting certain qualities and ignoring others. Your bodies not only change completely every seven years, for example. They change constantly with each breath.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:12。)在肉体内，原子与分子不断在死亡与更新。荷尔蒙则在一种不断运动与改变的状况。皮肤与细胞的电磁属性继续不断地跳跃与变更，甚至自己逆转。在一瞬前组成你身体的物质与这一刹那形成你身体的东西，在很重要的方面有所不同。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:12.) Within the flesh, atoms and molecules constantly die and are replaced. The hormones are in a constant state of motion and alteration. Electromagnetic properties of skin and cell continually leap and change, and even reverse themselves. The physical matter that composed your body a moment ago is different in important ways from the matter that forms your body in this instant.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你对你身体仿佛的永恒性很注意，如果你以同样执着的态度去感知在你体内经常不断的改变，那么你会惊异你以前怎么会认为身体是一个或多或少恒常不变的，有内聚力的存有。即使在主观方面，你也的确制造了一个比较稳定、比较永恒的有意识自己的概念，并聚焦其上。你强调那些从你“过去的”经验回想到的概念、思想与态度，当作是你自己的，而全盘忽略一度是“你特具的”而现已消失的那些——也忽略你不能抓住思想这个事实。以你们来说，前一刻的思想已消逝无踪。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>If you perceived the constant change within your body with as much persistence as you attend to its seemingly permanent nature, then you would be amazed that you ever considered the body as one more or less constant, more or less cohesive, entity. Even subjectively you focus upon and indeed manufacture the idea of a relatively stable, relatively permanent conscious self. You stress those ideas and thoughts and attitudes that you recall from “past” experience as your own, completely ignoring those that once were “characteristic” and now are vanished ---- ignoring the fact also that you cannot hold thought. The thought of a moment before, in your terms, vanishes away.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们试想维持一个恒常的、相对永久的实质而主观的自己，以便维持一个相当不变而永久的环境。因此你们永远处在忽略这种改变的地位。那些你们拒绝承认的事，就恰能使你对实相的真实本质、个人的主观性和仿佛环绕着你们的物质环境有个深得多的了解。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You try to maintain a constant, relatively permanent physical and subjective self in order to maintain a relatively constant, relatively permanent environment. So you are always in a position of ignoring such changes. Those that you refuse to acknowledge are precisely those that would give you a much better understanding of the true nature of reality, individual subjectivity, and the physical environment that seems to surround you.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:23。以上的段落讲得快得多。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:23. The above paragraphs were given at a much faster pace.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">当一个思想离开了你的意识心后，它怎么样了？它并不就这样消失。你可以学会跟踪它，但你通常很怕把你注意力的焦点由三次元的存在移开。因此，思想看起来像是消失了。同时你的“主观性”仿佛具有一种神秘而不可知的特质，甚至你的精神生命也有一种隐伏的坠落点，一个主观性的悬崖，思想与记忆由它上面翻坠而消失入空无。因此为了保护自己，保护你的主观性不至流逝，在你假设的危险地点，你矗立各种不同的心理障碍。要知道，反过来，只要你体认到，除了在你主要与之认同的方向外，你自己的实相还在另一个方向继续，你便可以跟踪那些思想和情感，因为这些已离开你意识心的思想与情感会引领你进入其他的环境。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>What happens to a thought when it leaves your conscious mind? It does not simply disappear. You can learn to follow it, but you are usually frightened of turning your attention away from its intense focus in three-dimensional existence. Therefore, it seems that the thought disappears. It seems also that your subjectivity has a mysterious unknown quality about it, and that even yourmental life has a sort of insidious dropping-off point, a subjective cliff over which thoughts and memories fall, to disappear into nothingness. Therefore to protect yourself, to protect your subjectivity from drifting, you erect various psychological barriers at what you suppose to be the danger points. Instead, you see, you can follow these thoughts and feelings simply by realizing that your own reality continues in another direction, beside the one with which you mainly identify. For these thoughts and feelings that have left your conscious mind will lead you into other environments.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:29。)思想似乎经过这些主观的开口而消失，事实上，这些开口好像心灵的曲速面，将你所知的自己与其他的经验宇宙连接——在那些实相中象征活了起来，而思想的潜能也没有被否认。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:29.) These subjective openings through which thoughts seem to disappear are in fact like psychic warps, connecting the self that you know with other universes of experience ---- realities where symbols come to life and thoughts are not denied their potential.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在你们的梦境，这些其他的实相与你自己的实相间有所沟通，两者间有经常不断的相互作用。如果有任何一个点，在那儿你自己的意识似乎闪避你或逃离你，或如有任何一个点，在那儿你的意识似乎完结了，那么这些就是你自己建立起心理与心灵障碍的地点，而这就恰是那些你们应当探究的区域。否则你觉得好像你的意识是关闭在你的头壳之内，不能动而且受限制，而每一个遗失的思想或忘掉的记忆至少象征一次小的死亡，而那并不是事实。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There is communication between these other realities and your own in your dream states, and a constant interaction between both systems. If there is any point where your own consciousness seems to elude you or escape you, or if there is any point where your consciousness seems to end, then these are the points where you have yourselves set up psychological and psychic barriers, and these are precisely those areas that you should explore. Otherwise you feel as if your consciousness is enclosed within your skull, immobile and constricted, and every lost thought or forgotten memory at least symbolically seems like a small death. And such is not the case.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我建议你们休息。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I suggest your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:36。这次珍的出神状态较深；她没被任何噪音所扰，在10:52继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:36. Jane’s trance had been deeper this time; she hadn’t been bothered by any kind of noise. Resume at 10:52.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：今晚的口述到此结束。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: That is the end of dictation for this evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(现在赛斯简短地讨论了一下珍在昨天下午所经历的一些“出体”事件。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Now Seth briefly discussed some out-of-body episodes that Jane had experienced yesterday afternoon.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那么，我就结束此节，并且给你俩最衷心的祝福；我还想提醒鲁柏我对他的床的建议。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I will, then, end our session with my heartiest regards to you both; and may I remind Ruburt again of the suggestion I made concerning his bed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安”。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good night, Seth.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(11:05。见第519节，赛斯在其中建议珍试着把我们的床转为南北向。我们仍未照做。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(11:05 P.M. See the 519th session, in which Seth suggests that Jane try turning our bed to a north-south position. We haven’t done this yet.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(珍仍阅读赛斯为他的书所给的资料。我可以感到她对这些资料的忧心已减退了许多，但同时她对它的兴趣仍然与从前一样地热烈。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane still reads Seth’s material on his book. I can tell that her concern about it is much diminished, but also that her interest in it is as lively as ever.)</details><br>
