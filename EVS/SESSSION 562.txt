<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 561,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第561节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>NOVEMBER 25, 1970, 9:55 P.M. WEDNESDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1970年11月25日 星期三 晚上9：55</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Just as the session was about to begin at 9:15, Jane said she thought we’d be interrupted somehow, or have visitors. Not fifteen seconds later there was a knock at the door. It was Carl Jones. He teaches a high school course called “Inner and Outer Space,” in a small city in Connecticut; the class uses Jane’s book, The Seth Material, as text. Carl was on his way to a destination near Niagara Falls, New York, for the Thanksgiving holidays.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:15正当要开始的时候，珍说她想我们恐怕会被打扰，或是会有访客。不到十五秒之后就有人敲门，原来是卡尔·琼斯。他在康乃狄克州一个小城的高中教一门课叫做“内在与外在宇宙”，用珍的书《灵界的讯息》作课本。卡尔是在感恩节假期去尼加拉瀑布附近的路上顺道来访。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>And good evening to our friend here, and I will take due note that you (Carl) are smiling this evening. Now: We are going to resume dictation on our book, so (humorously to Carl) you can see an author at work ---- an authentic ghost writer if you prefer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>也祝我们这儿的朋友晚安；我会好好记住今晚你(卡尔)是面带笑容的。现在：我们将继续写书，因此(对卡尔幽默地：)你可以看到一个作家在工作——如果你喜欢的话，可说是一个真正为人捉刀的“幽灵作家”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I will in due time identify the figure of the third Christ personality. Now, however, I am concerned with the multidimensional aspects of All That Is. Such a reality can only be experienced. There are no facts that can be given that can portray with any faithfulness the attributes of All That Is.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在适当的时候我会指认出第三位基督。不过现在我关注的是“一切万有”的多次元面貌。这样一种实相只能被体验感受到。任何事实都无法忠实地描绘出“一切万有”的属性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This reality and those attributes will appear within various systems of actuality in keeping with the camouflage data of any given system. The inner experience with the multidimensional God can come in two main areas. One is through the realization that this prime moving force is within everything that you can perceive with your senses. The other method is to realize that this primary motive force has a reality independent of its connection with the world of appearances.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这个实相与那些属性将出现在各种不同的确实性系统里，而与那任一系统的伪装资料协调一致。你对多次元的“神”的内在体验可以来自两个主要区域：一是经由领悟到这原始的推动力量是在你以感官所能感知的任何事物中；另一方法是了悟这原始的动机力量具有一个独立于它与表象世界的关联之外的实相。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>All personal contact with the multidimensional God, all legitimate moments of mystic consciousness, will always have a unifying effect. They will not, therefore, isolate the individual involved, but instead will enlarge his perceptions until he will experience the reality and uniqueness of as many other aspects of reality of which he is capable.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>所有与多次元“神”的个人接触，所有正统神秘意识的瞬间，都永远有一种统合的效果。因此，它们不会孤立所涉及的个人，反而会扩大他的感知力，直到他能体验到尽他所能最多实相的其他各面之真实性和独特性。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:05.) He will feel, therefore, less isolated and less set apart. He will not regard himself as being above others because of the experience. On the contrary he will be swept along in a gestalt of comprehension in which he realizes his own oneness with All That Is.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:05)因此，他会感到比较不孤立，比较不被隔离。他不会因那个经验而以为自己在别人之上。相反地，他会被一种理解的完形席卷，而他了悟自己与“一切万有”的合一。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As there are portions of reality that you do not consciously perceive, and other systems of probability of which you are not consciously aware, so also are there aspects of primary godhood that you cannot at this moment comprehend. There are, therefore, probable gods, each one reflecting in its way the multidimensional aspects of a prime identity so great and dazzling that no one reality form or particular kind of existence could contain it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>就像你不能有意识地感知实相的有些部分，还有其他的可能系统无法有意识地知觉，因而也有“原始神性”的一些面貌是你此刻仍不能理解的。因此，这些可能的神明(probable gods)，每一个以它的方式反映一个基本本体(prime entity)的多次元面貌，这基本本体是如此伟大、如此耀眼，以致没有任何一个实相—形式(reality-form)或某一种存在能包容它。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:10.) I have tried to give you some idea of the far-reaching creative effects of your own thoughts. With that in mind, then, it is impossible to imagine the multidimensional creativities that can be attributed to All That Is. The term ‘All That Is’ can be used as a designation to include all of those probable gods in all of their manifestations.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:10)我曾试着告诉你们一点关于你们自己思想影响深远的创造性效果。那么，知道这一点，就能了解要去想象可以归属于“一切万有”的那些多次元创造是不可能的。“一切万有”这个词，可被用来指称包括所有那些可能的神明的所有示现。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now it is easier perhaps for some of you to understand the simple stories and parables of beginnings of which I have spoken. But the time has come for mankind to take several steps further, to expand the nature of his own consciousness by trying to comprehend a more profound version of reality. You have outgrown the time of children’s tales. When your own thoughts have a form and reality, when they have validity even in other systems of reality of which you are unaware, then it is not difficult to understand why other systems of Probabilities are also affected by your own thoughts and feelings ---- nor why the actions of the probable gods are not affected by what happens in other dimensions of existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你们有些人也许比较容易了解我所说的创始的简单故事与寓言。但是现在时候已经到了，人类应再向前迈进几步，以尝试理解实相更深奥的面貌来扩展他自己意识的本质。你们已经长大，超过听童话的时候了。当你自己的思想有一个形式和实相，当它们在你不知觉的其他实相系统里也有其确实性的时候，那就不难了解，为何其他的可能系统也被你自己的思想和情感所影响——或为何可能的神明行动不被其他存在次元所发生的事所影响。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:15. Jane’s pace had been good. After an average-length break an unrecorded interval of material followed, with Seth mainly answering questions for Carl. A few points were mentioned, however, that I later wished I had written down. [This is usually the case when I don’t take notes.] One such point had to do with Seth’s statement that whenever a person thinks strongly about another person, a portion of the “thinker” goes out to the “thought-subject,” etc.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:15。珍的步调很好。在一次普通长度的休息之后，跟着有一段没记录下来的资料，主要是赛斯在回答卡尔的问题。不过，所提到的有几点事后我希望我曾写下来〔当我没笔录时常常是这样子〕。我后悔没记下来的一点是：赛斯声明说，凡当一个人强烈地想念另一个人时，“想念者”的一部分会走出去到“被想念的人”身边等等。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Another break followed. During it Carl left, to continue his holiday journey westward…. I had grown concerned lately that Jane was overdoing weekend psychic work, including sessions for visitors. We talked about this now ---- without expecting Seth to discuss it ---- and agreed that she’d have to slack off on such extracurricular adventures, no matter how interesting the “provocation.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(接着有一次休息。卡尔离开了，继续他西向的度假旅程……最近我对珍周末过度的心灵工作——包括为访客举行的课——渐感担心。现在我们谈到这件事——并没期望赛斯来讨论它——而彼此同意她必须松懈这种课外的探险，不管那“诱因”是多么有趣。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Resume at 11:10.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在11:10继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: I have something to say. Your suggestion about weekends is a good one, and Ruburt is prepared to follow it. When you are having regular sessions, an occasional visitor will not annoy you, but such visits should be known in advance.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：我有些话要说。你对周末的建议很好，鲁柏也准备照办。当你在上定期课的时候，偶然有位访客不致烦扰你，但这种拜访应事先约好。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Ruburt is subconsciously aware of them in most cases, but seldom brings this to consciousness, so it is simply a feeling of disquietude on his part. He feels he will be interrupted, but is not consciously aware of this, you see.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在大多数情形，鲁柏对这种事潜意识地知道，却很少把它带到意识里去，因此在他来说只是有一种不安宁的感觉。他觉得他会被打扰，但又不是有意识的觉察到这事，你懂吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now I suggest that our regular sessions for a while be held in one of your back rooms, (where my studio is), for two reasons. You will know the phone will not interrupt you, with both doors closed. Simply ignore it. Let it be known that anyone who wants to attend private sessions must then arrange so in advance. Otherwise you would not hear them at the door.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>其次我建议，我们定期的课暂且在你们后面的房间(我画室所在的地方)里上，我有两个理由。其一是，在两道门关上后，你可以确知不会被电话所扰。别理它就是了。其二是，让大家知道任何想参加私人课的人，必须事先安排，不然你听不见他们敲门，也就不会应门。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The back room idea, however, will serve to reinforce the private nature of the sessions in your own minds. All work dealing with other people generally will be done in whatever room class sessions are held.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，这个换到后房的想法，会有加强你们自己心中这些定期课保有私密作用。所有与其他人有关的工作，则在别的不论什么赛斯课里做。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The idea of the back room will also serve as a psychological set for withdrawal from ordinary physical concerns and relationships with others. I am not saying that you should not allow certain specific individuals at times to attend private sessions. I am now stressing, however, that the two regular sessions should be held, and I am saying this now knowing that Ruburt is able and willing to follow my suggestions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>后房的想法也可用作一个心理的布景，以从日常生活所关心的事及与他人的关系中撤退。我并不是说你不该有时允许某些特定的人参加私人课。不过，我也不强调每周应有两次定期课，现在我这样说是因为我知道鲁柏可能并且愿意听我的建议。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In the summertime the rooms in the back may or may not be beneficial. There were natural changes occurring in our work, and overall Ruburt has done well in handling them. The unevenness in the timing of our sessions was a result of the fact that often three regular sessions were being expected from him, rather than two.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在夏季里，后面的房间不一定有好处。在我们的工作里曾有自然的变化发生，整个说来鲁柏对它们处理得很好。我们上课时间的不平均是归因于一个事实：通常我们期待他上三课而非两课。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Often spontaneously we had class sessions, and as you noticed he would miss our next session. He thought that two sessions were quite enough. Our regular sessions will always be the primary source of the material, and the stress will always be laid upon them. Nevertheless, the class sessions serve an important purpose. They are a subsidiary or offshoot, but they are not meant to supersede our own work.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在ESP班我们往往会有即兴赛斯课，而如你注意到的，他会漏掉我们的下一课。他认为上两次课就已相当够了。我们的定期课将永远是资料的主要来源，它们永远是我们特别着重的。虽然如此，心灵班的课也达到一项重要的目的。它们是一个从属或分支，但它们不应取代我们自己的工作。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>At no time for now, and until I say so, should over three sessions a week be held. Now it may seem to you that it is merely a matter of my not being available if I think Ruburt should not have an extra session. (I don’t think this at all.) Remember, however, what I told you much earlier. Sometimes I am very directly concerned in a session, and sometimes you get a session that has been programmed. This is putting it very simply, but you know what I mean.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>目前每周不要有超过三节的课，直到我说要如此为止。如果我认为鲁柏不该有一节额外的课，可能你们看来只是因为我没有空。(我完全不如此认为。)不过，要记得我先前告诉你们的：有时候我是很直接地参与一节课，而有时候你们得到一节预制好的课。这是非常简化的说法，但你懂我的意思。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>So, using the psychological bridge at such times, Ruburt can have a session. I have made what I think clear and specific. Now: Work he does with impressions is an entirely different thing. He is not pulling in the same kind of energy. It is not a matter of a session taking something out of Ruburt. It is a matter of tuning into the kind of energy that he does in our sessions, and simply because of present circumstances and development, three times a week is sufficient.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，在那种时候，利用“心理的桥梁”鲁柏就可以上课。我已把我所想的说得很清楚了。至于，他靠自己的印象而做的工作是一件全然不同的事，他并没有拉进同类的能量。上课并没有由鲁柏那儿拿走了什么东西，而是他得对准在我们的课里他所用的那种能量，只不过就目前的环境和发展而言，一周三次就够了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Our two sessions should always be maintained, with the class sessions added as long as they do not drain Ruburt’s resources. The phone should not be answered, however. Strangers who write can be invited to the Tuesday classes. On certain occasions, using your own discretions, you may have guests at our sessions, but these will be very occasional, and will not be a problem if you follow the procedure I have outlined.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们的两节课应该总是维持不变，在不汲干鲁柏精力的情况下，总可以加上心灵班的课。不过，不应接电话。可以邀写信来的陌生人参加星期二的课。在某些情况，你们可以自己斟酌，在我们的课你们可以有客人，但这将是极少有的，如果你依照我所提出的大略程序去做，应不会有困难。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Do you have questions?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你有问题吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“No.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“没有。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will end the session, or take a break then as you prefer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，我们将结束此节，或者休息，随你的便。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“We might as well end it then.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“那我们就结束好了。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:30. This wasn’t the end of the session after all. Seth returned after a short break, and we had a discussion about class sessions and other things that lasted until 11:50 P.M.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:30，结果这并没完。在短短的休息后赛斯又回来，我们对心灵班的课和其他事讨论到11:50。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth did make a prediction: Jane will write an excellent book about the class sessions, and this will lead many to read the regular Seth material. Seth added that the material itself, in session format, will be published in its entirety one day. This is a personal goal of mine.) *See Chapter Eighteen of The Seth Material.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯倒的确作了个预言：珍将写一本关于心灵班的极佳的书，而将引得许多人去读“赛斯资料”，赛斯又说资料本身有一天将以逐节逐节的方式全部出版，这也是我的一个个人目标。)</a>
