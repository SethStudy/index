<div style="display:inline">1971年4月21日 星期三 晚上9：30</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>APRIL 21, 1971, 9:30 P.M. WEDNESDAY</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(昨晚，星期二，当珍在客厅上ESP课时我去睡了。那时差不多是11:30。在我躺着假寐时，我提示自己，在早晨我会记得我的梦而把它写下来。够奇怪的，我并没有提及“实体投射”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Last night, Tuesday, I went to bed while Jane was holding ESP class in the living room. It was about 11:30. As I lay dozing I gave myself suggestions that I would recall my dreams in the morning and write them down. Oddly enough, I didn’t mention “astral projection.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(我睡得相当不安稳，在ESP班仍在进行时我醒了好几次。最后，我模模糊糊地觉得听到班上成员的车子开离房子隔壁停车场的声音。然后我睡着了。珍后来说她是在12:40上床的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(I slept rather uneasily, waking up several times while class was still in progress. Finally, I was hazily aware of hearing the cars of class members as they pulled out of the parking lot next to the house. Then I slept. Jane said later that she came to bed at 12:45 A.M.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(我知道的下一件事，就是我在我们黑暗的浴室里飞翔。我是在一种无身体的状态而一点都不烦心。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(The next thing I knew, I was hovering in the air in our darkened bathroom. I was in a bodiless state without being at all upset.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(浴室在我们公寓的中央；客厅在它的一边，卧室与我的画室在另一边。为了不让我们的猫威立晚上上床，我们把它放在客厅而关上浴室靠那边的门。现在我发现自己悬在那门的前面，无法穿透它。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(The bathroom is in the center of our apartment; the living room is on one side of it, the bedroom and my studio on the other. In order to keep our cat, Willy, off our bed at night, we put him in the living room and close the door on that side of the bathroom. Now I found myself hanging in front of that door, unable to penetrate it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(我没感到惊惶或恐惧。我灵体的眼睛(astral eyes)看得见。在我右方一些微弱的光线由一扇开着的窄窗透进来。关着的门则在很深的暗影里，但我知道我在它前面。虽然在我身“后”的卧室里，我的身体仍躺在珍旁边睡着，我没为它操心。最先我没悟到我是在投射——好比说我没有想到命令自己穿过门进到客厅去。但慢慢地我才知道我是在自己身体外，在这非常舒服的无重量状态。对我实际离开我的身体而移进浴室来这回事，我则完全不记得。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(I felt no panic, no fear. My astral eyes were functioning. A weak light came through a narrow open window to my right. The closed door was in deep shadow, but I knew I was before it. Although my body lay sleeping beside Jane in the bedroom “behind” me, I wasn’t concerned about it. I didn’t realize that I was projecting at first ---- I didn’t have the presence of mind, say, to order myself to burst through the door into the living room. But that I was out of my body, and in this very pleasant weightless state, did slowly make itself known to me. I had no memory of actually leaving my body and moving into the bathroom.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在我颇不寻常的投射里，这是第一次没有恐惧的因素在场。然则我相信我认为门不能被穿透这个平常的有意识概念使我被挡住了。在遭到这关着的门所造成的“此路不通”后，我又睡着了一会儿。当我再变得有知觉，显然在几分钟后，我发现自己刚刚浮在躺在床上的我自己肉体的上方。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(This was the first time that no element of fear was present in any of my rather infrequent projections. I believe my ordinary conscious ideas that doors can’t be penetrated held me back, though. I fell asleep again briefly after encountering the impasse posed by the closed door. When I became aware again, evidently a few moments later, I found myself floating just above my physical body as it lay in bed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(我恰巧是平躺着睡，两臂搁在身侧。我的灵体在差不多同样的位置，也许在六寸之上。我的情况是出奇地稳定、舒服；我觉得很清醒，知道我在做什么而十分自由且无重量。我听见自己在打鼾，对此事没十分注意——尚未。我知道自己不是在做梦。我甚至记起好几次读过当一个人投射时，他知道那情状和做梦状况的不同。这一点现在我可以直接体证。我非常高兴。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(It happened that I lay sleeping flat on my back with my arms down at my sides. My astral body was in the same approximate position, perhaps six inches above. My state was remarkably steady and pleasant: I felt awake, aware of what I was up to, and quite free and weightless. I heard myself snoring, without paying much attention to that fact ---- yet. I knew I wasn’t dreaming. I even remembered reading at various times that when projecting one knows the difference between that state and a dreaming one. This I could now attest to at firsthand. I was very pleased.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(这次我有个不同类的幻相。我好像特别注意我的双腿，悬在我肉体的腿之上。我兴冲冲地摆动它们，抬上抬下，享受它们拥有的自由与轻快的美妙感觉。我知道我肉体的腿无法那么自由地运动，虽然它们很健康。我灵体的腿感觉相当像橡皮，它们是如此地松弛而有弹性——不知怎的，从我面向下的位置，我可看见它们颜色很淡而从膝盖以下是半透明的！</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(I had a different kind of vision this time. In some fashion I was aware of my legs especially, suspended above my physical ones. I took great pleasure in wiggling them about, shaking them up and down, enjoying the marvelous sense of freedom and lightness they possessed. I knew my physical legs couldn’t move that freely, although they are in good shape. My astral legs felt quite rubbery, so loose and flexible were they ---- and somehow, from my prone position, I could see that they were light-colored and translucent from the knees down!</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(既然我的投射状态似乎是如此稳定，我开始想它给了我一个很大的机会。再次地，我不觉害怕，只是自信满满。我想这是一个做点什么事的大好时光。这才是个很好的冒险时机，我告诉自己我愿意试任何事——到某个别的实相去看看、撞穿门进入客厅、到屋前的街上逛逛……</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Since my projection state seemed to be so reliable, I began to think it offered great opportunities. I felt no fear, again, only confidence. I thought that this would be a great time to do something. Now was the time for a fine adventure. I told myself I was willing to try anything ---- a visit to some other reality, a plunge through the door into the living room, a trip down the street in front of the house….</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在这段时间珍一直躺在我身旁。她后来说当她上床时，我正鼾声大作。我的注意力现在开始改变其焦点；我才第一次真的听见自己的鼾声。我对刚在“我”下面、我肉体的头发出的声音之大惊奇不已。当我醒时我不可能仿造出那声音。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(All this time Jane lay beside me. She said afterward that I was snoring loudly when she came to bed. My attention now began to change its focus; for the first time I really heard myself. I was amazed at the loudness of the sounds that came from my physical head, just beneath “me.” I couldn’t possibly duplicate them while awake.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(我好几次十分有意的、故意的企图“开始行动”，由我的身体走开，却不成功。我努力并没打破这投射；我只是仍在我本来的地方飞来飞去。然后我有了个主意：我要用我打鼾的声音作为一个起动力，送我一飞冲天而进入别的实相，把我的肉体远远留在床上。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Without success, I made several quite conscious and deliberate attempts to “get going,” and travel away from my body. My efforts didn’t break the projection spell; I merely remained hovering where I was. Then I had an idea: I would use the sound of my snoring as an impetus to send myself soaring off into other dimensions, leaving my body far behind me on the bed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(我故意开始“更”大声地打鼾——如果还可能更大声的话。我要建立起一个庞大的“声音—起动力”，用它作推进力，虽然我不知道这该如何发生作用。奇怪的是，我满喜欢躺在我肉体上方的感觉，以及我能用后者来发出声音这两件事。在此这暗示了一个双重意识，因我对两个身体都有知觉。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Deliberately I began to snore even louder, if possible. I wanted to build up a massive sound-impetus that I would use as a propellant, although I didn’t know how this was supposed to work. The strange thing is, I enjoyed both the feeling of lying just above my physical body, and my ability to use the latter to produce sound. This implies a dual consciousness here, since I was aware of both bodies.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(要不是我听见我的鼾声声量真的增加了，就是我对它更厉害地集中焦点。不管怎样，我的主意却不管用。我还是不知道到底我会不会成功地起飞，因为现在珍对我说：“亲爱的，你在打鼾。翻个身。”就像当她听我打鼾听得不耐烦了时常做的。我清楚地听见它。我立即停止打鼾，但没动。我不记得重回到我的身体。最后我轻轻推她，费了些劲才告诉她发生过的一些事。她认为我听来好像仍在出神状态。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Either I heard my snoring actually increase in volume, or I focused upon it even more acutely. My idea wasn’t working, anyhow. I don’t know whether I would have eventually succeeded in taking off, for Jane now said to me: “Honey, you’re snoring. Turn over,” as she usually does when she gets tired of listening to me. I heard her clearly. I stopped snoring at once, but didn’t move. I don’t remember rejoining my physical body. Finally I nudged her, and with an effort told her something of what had transpired. She thought I sounded as though I was still in a trance.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(我觉得好像可能会再投射，因此在珍安静地躺在我身旁时，我一再尝试。我并没成功，虽然围绕着整个插曲很舒服的灵光仍非常确切地留连不去。这投射虽然很小，却似如此轻易、自然，使我奇怪为什么它不是件经常发生的事。我一直都知道有比我能够完成多得多的可能性——刚在我当时的能力之外有美妙的可能性，如果我能打破那……障碍。我完全没感到任何恐慌，我完全没看到或感觉那“灵体的银带”(astral silver cord)，最后我睡着了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(I felt as though I might project again, so I kept trying while Jane lay quietly beside me. I had no success, although the very pleasant aura surrounding the whole episode lingered most definitely. The projection, small as it was, had seemed so easy and natural that I wondered why it wasn’t a commonplace. I knew all the while that much more was possible than I was able to accomplish ---- that just beyond my abilities of the moment lay wonderful possibilities if I could just break that… barrier. I never did feel any alarm, and at no time did I see, or feel, the “astral silver cord.” Finally I slept.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(这次经历引起了一两个问题。我将之加进第二十章的单子中：一、我自己的投射是如此的愉快，但更重要的是它包含了这么多潜能，以致令我奇怪：为何西方人没对这些能力知道得更多？二、为什么西方人没培育它们、利用它们？我希望赛斯今晚会加以评论。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(The experience gave rise to a couple of questions which I added to the list for Chapter Twenty: 1.?My own projection was so enjoyable, but more importantly contained so many potentials, that I wonder why Western man isn’t more aware of these abilities. 2.?Why doesn’t he cultivate them and put them to use? I hoped Seth would comment tonight.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">恭喜。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>And congratulations.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“谢谢。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Thank you.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">下面的话是对你说的：你选了那个时候试做那实验，可以说你是有备无患的，因为一旦你被吓着了，你很清楚鲁柏就快要来睡觉。不过，你已准备好再试一次，选了个缓慢而容易的方法，安适的环境，也使得它容易做些，因此在你真的做出任何太冒险的事之前，你能对那感觉变得熟悉一些。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This is to you: You tried the experiment when you did, having an ace in the hole, so to speak, in case you became frightened, knowing full well that Ruburt would be coming to bed. You were ready to try again, however, and picked a slow and easy method, pleasant surroundings, to make it easy for you also, so that you could become familiar with the sensation before you actually did anything too adventurous with it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“我在珍上床之前试过这样做吗？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Did I try this before Jane came to bed?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">没有。你在她没来前开始试，但直到她来睡时你才成功。人对时间的感觉，在身体外与在身体内可能相当不同。你知道有了一次成功的经验你会自由得多，因此你选择了最好的情况。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>No. You began your attempts before, but did not succeed until Ruburt came to bed. The time sense outside the body can be quite different than the body’s. You knew that with one successful experience you would be much more free, and so you chose the best of circumstances.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你的确有可能离开公寓。不过，打鼾也算是给鲁柏的一个信号，你知道他会叫醒你，这是打鼾的原始动机。你明白，如果你不喜欢这实验，它就会被中止。可是，同时你又觉得很高兴而决定用那噪音作一个推动力，但接着就发生了鲁柏对鼾声的通常反应。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You could have left the apartment indeed. The snoring was also, however, supposed to be a signal to Ruburt. You knew he would awaken you. This was the original motivation for it. If you did not like the experiment, you see, it would have been terminated. In the meantime, however, you were delighted, and decided upon the noise as a propellant, but Ruburt’s usual reaction to the snoring took place.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你现在应会发现，你自己记起来好几次这种经验。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You should find yourself remembering quite a few such experiences now.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(当我由我的笔记打好这一节的字时，是4月25日，星期日。自从4月21日起我就一直满怀希望等着另一次的投射，却落空了。在另一个不同的场合，我有一次相当小的“出体”，其后几乎有两周之久尾随着一连串不完全的投射，或包括这种现象的扭曲成分的梦。这很奇怪，尾随在地震后的余震差可比拟。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(It is Sunday, April 25, as I type up this session from my notes. Ever since April 21 I have been waiting expectantly, and in vain, for another projection. On a different occasion I had a rather small out-of-body that trailed behind it, for almost two weeks, a series of incomplete projections or dream experiences containing distorted elements of such phenomena. Strangely, an analogy might be the aftershocks following a quake….)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在来回答你的问题：西方人选择了他的精力向外贯注，而大大忽略了内心世界。社会与文化各方面，甚至连宗教方面自童年起都自动抑制了这种经验。在你们的社会，会“出体”完全没有任何社会利益，倒有许多反对它的禁忌。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now in answer to your questions: Western man has chosen to focus his energy outward and largely ignore inner realities. The social and cultural aspects, and even the religious ones, automatically inhibit such experiences from childhood on. There is no social benefit at all connected with projections in your society, and many taboos against it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:40)当然，这是所有涉足于那文明的人的共同选择。在大家都达到中庸与了解之前也有些平衡存在。有些人选择转世到外在取向的社会，以补偿它过去活过的极为内省式的人生，那时他对物质的操纵很不在行。你明白吗？人们学到内在实相与外在实相两者都必得了解而予以建设性的利用。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:40.) This is, of course, chosen by those involved in that civilization. There are also balances that exist before moderation and understanding are reached. Some personalities choose to be reincarnated in exteriorly oriented societies, in compensation for lives that were lived with great concentration inward, and very poor physical manipulation. Man learns, you see, that inner reality and outer reality both must be understood and used constructively.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">当然不论你记不记得，在睡眠状态都经常发生投射。当有某种理由要忆起它们时，当涉及到一些功绩或明显的成就时，好比在那些认为利用梦与投射是非常有利的社会里，你就会记起那些投射。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Projections occur of course in the sleep state constantly, whether or not they are remembered. They are recalled when there is some reason to do so, some merit or obvious achievement involved, as in societies where it is considered highly advantageous to use dreams and projections.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">举例言之，如果你目前在经历一种生活，在其中你选择特别强调人体的旅行载运上面，那么经由飞翔的梦，模糊的记忆，你可能被激励而努力于好比说飞机或火箭的发明。但如果你确实了解自己的意识的确能神游于体外这个事实，那么朝向人体载运工具发展的推动力就不会那么强烈了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>If you are presently experiencing a life in which you have chosen high emphasis upon physical locomotion, for example, then through vague dream memories of flying you can be inspired toward, say, the invention of airplanes or rockets; but if you actually understand the fact that your own consciousness can indeed travel outside of the body, then the impetus toward physical developments in locomotion is not nearly so intense.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那么，你还有些什么问题？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now. What questions do you have?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“第五十三：在1968年8月14日的第429节，你说有些人格可以同时是几个‘存有’的一部分。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Number fifty-three: In the 429th session for August 14, 1968, you said that some personalities can be a part of more than one entity.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我曾多次提到此事。“自己”并没有界限，它的发展也没有阻碍。一个人格可能“最初”是某个存有的一部分，而独立发展出十分不同的兴趣。它可以靠自己走一条孤独路，或反之它可以把自己攀附于或被吸引到另一个志同道合的“存有”那儿去。原来的联系不会被切断，但新的联系建立起来了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I have mentioned this many times. There are no boundaries to the self, and no barriers put upon its development. A personality may “originally” be a part of a given entity, and on its own develop interests quite different. It can on its own take a lonely way, or it can instead attach itself or gravitate toward other entities with interests like its own. The original connection will not be severed, but new ones made and formed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在9:47停顿。“第四十六：在《灵界的讯息》的第十九章你给了一个‘内在感官’的名单。还有没有更多你还没有告诉我们的‘内在感官’？)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 9:47. “Number forty-six. In Chapter Nineteen of The Seth Material you gave a list of the inner senses. Are there more of these that you haven’t told us about?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">的确还有。不过，它们是与那些潜在性、平常在你们这特定系统里不会遇到的经验有关(停顿)。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There are indeed. They have to do, however, with experiences that you will not normally encounter in your particular system, that lie latent. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">几乎任何细胞都有能力长成为任何既定器官，或形成身体的任何部分。它有能力去发展成感觉器官，而实际地说，如果这细胞变成一个手肘或膝盖，那这能力就不会被发展，但它是在那儿的。这不仅适用于你们自己的物类，在许多例子里也适用于物类与物类之间。在所有的生物里，有些基本单位有能力形成动物或植物的生命，有能力发展在任一种这种生物中固有的感知机制。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Almost any cell has the capacity for growing into any given organ, or forming any part of the body. It has the capacity for developing sense organs that, practically speaking, will not be developed if the cell becomes an elbow or a knee, but the capacity is there. This applies not only to your own species but in many cases between species, and there are basic units in all living matter capable of forming animal or vegetable life, capable of developing the perceptive mechanisms inherent in any of these.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此，理论上你是可能由一只青蛙、一只鸟或一只蚂蚁的眼中看世界的。在此我们谈的是肉体感官。在意识向一个特定的伪装系统对准频率时，“内我”通常所应用的感官之外，也有潜伏的“内在感官”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It is therefore theoretically possible for you to see the world through a frog’s eye, or a bird’s or an ant’s. We are speaking here of physical senses. The inner self has also latent inner senses beside the ones that it normally uses while the consciousness is tuned into a particular camouflage system.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，有些内在感官是无法以具体方式来表达的，只有用比喻来暗示它们的性质。在本书中没有必要讨论它们。它们属于一本特为讨论内在感知方法的书。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Some, however, are inexpressible in physical terms, and only analogies could be used to hint of their nature. In this book there is no need to discuss them. They belong in a book given more specifically to interior methods of perception.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“第五十五：这问题是来自你对第十一个问题的答复，当我问你关于珍为了要传述古老的‘说法者’手稿之一所需要的训练。你说那些古老语言有些涉及了图画与象征符号。当她在出神状态里，以你的帮助，她能否画出一些图画——字或象征？我只是好奇，想知道她能不能画出一个近似‘说法者’的语言？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Number fifty-five: This question comes from the answer you gave to number eleven, when I asked you about the training Jane would need in order to deliver one of the ancient Speaker manuscripts. You said some of those old languages involved pictures and symbols. With your help while she’s in trance, could Jane make drawings of a few picture-words or symbols? I’m just curious to see if she could approximate one of the Speaker languages.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这是可能的。(“那会是非常有趣的。”赛斯停下来，所以我问：“她现在能不能试？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This is possible. (“That would be very interesting.” Seth paused, so I asked, “Can she try it now?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这不是时候。(停顿。)在这些图形之间有许多被扭曲的内在关联。“穆”(Mu)文明用了些象形文与符号。在你们查核你们的问题时，我建议休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This is not the time. (Pause.) There are many distorted inner connections between these. Some hieroglyphics and the symbols were used by the Mu civilization. I suggest a break then while you check your questions.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好吧。”</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Okay.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:00。珍和我看了看所剩的一些问题，但因为她似乎累了，我建议我们结束课的这个部分，余下的课给了个人的资料。在10:58结束。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:00. Jane and I went over some of the remaining questions, but since she seemed to be tiring I suggested we end this part of the session. The rest of it was given over to personal material. End at 10:58 P.M.)</details><br>
