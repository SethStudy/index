<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 575,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第575节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>MARCH 24, 1971, 9:05 P.M. WEDNESDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年3月24日 星期三 晚上9：05</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Compared to her intense approach in recent sessions, long portions of Jane’s delivery tonight were quiet and easy.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(与她近来几节中的紧张方式相较，珍今晚的传述有很长的部分是安静而放松的。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will resume dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，我们继续口述。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>A-4 brings you to a level that is beneath matter formations, a level in which ideas and concepts can be perceived, although their representations do not appear in the present physical reality that you know.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“A-4”把你带到一个层面，低于物质之形成，这是概念与观念在其中可被感知的一个层面，虽然它们的表征不会出现在你所知的现在物质实相之内。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>From this layer many of the deepest inspirations come. These ideas and concepts, having their own electromagnetic identity, nevertheless appear as “the symbolic landscape” at this level of consciousness. This is difficult to explain. The thoughts do not appear as pseudoimages for example, or assume any pseudomaterialization, yet they are felt vividly, perceived and picked up by portions of the brain ---- those seemingly unused portions for which science has found no answer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>许多最深的灵感来自这个层面。这些概念与观念有它们自己的电磁性本体，不过在这个意识层面上却出现为“象征性的风景”。这很难解释。例如，那思想不以假象出现或僭取任何假的具体化，他们却被脑的一部分——那些看似没有用到、科学无法解答的部分——活生生地感觉、感知和收到。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>These ideas and concepts obviously came from consciousness. However, they represent incipient latent developments that may or may not occur in physical reality. They may or may not be perceived by any given individual. The characteristic interest and abilities of the personality involved will have much to do with his recognition of the realities within this layer of consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这些概念与观念显然是来自意识。可是，他们代表一些初期潜在的发展，可能会也可能不会在物质实相里发生。所涉及的这个人特有的兴趣和能力，与他认知这意识层面实相的程度有很大关系。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:16. Jane, as Seth, took a lengthy pause as a fire engine passed the house, its siren screaming.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:16停顿。珍，作为赛斯，停了好一会儿，因为一辆救火车高鸣警笛驰过这房子。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The material available, however, represents building blocks for many probable systems. It is an open area into which many other dimensions have access. It often becomes available in sleep states. Complete innovations, world-shattering inventions ---- these all lie waiting, so to speak, in this huge reservoir. Strong personal “conversions” are often effected from this level. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，在这儿可得的资料代表了许多可能系统的建筑材料。它是个开放的区域，许多其他的次元都可以进入。常常在睡眠状态可以得到这些资料。完全的革新、震撼世界的发明——这些可谓全在这巨大的库藏里等着。强烈的个人“信仰改变”常是来自这层面的影响(停顿)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now any individual can pass through these levels and remain relatively untouched and unaware, can travel through them unperceiving. The overall intentions and characteristics of the personality will determine the quality of perception and understanding. The material mentioned is available in each of the levels of consciousness given, but it must be sought out, either through conscious desire or strong unconscious desire. If it is not, then the gifts available and the potentials simply remain unused and unclaimed.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>其实任何一个人，都能经过这些层面而维持相当的不为所动及不知不觉，也能无所见地旅行过此地。个人全盘性的目的与特性会决定他感知与了解的品质。所提及的资料在所说的每一个意识层面都有，但它必须透过有意识的欲望或强烈的无意识欲望而被找出来。若非如此，那么可得的礼物与潜能就依然没被用到、没被争取。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:25.) The states of consciousness merge also one into the other, and it is obvious that I am using the terms of depth to make the discussion easier. Starting with the ego or waking consciousness as the outer self focused toward exterior reality, these states are broad, more like plains to be explored. Each one, therefore, opens in great adjacent areas also, and there are many “paths” to be taken according to your interest and desire.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:25)意识的种种状态其实也是彼此相混的，很显然的，我用“深度”的说法只为方便讨论。这些状态始自自我或醒时意识——即贯注于外在实相的外在自己，它们是宽广的，更像是供探索的平原。因此，每一个意识状态也向很大的邻接区域开放，而按照你的兴趣与欲望，你可采取许多的“通路”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As your ordinary waking state perceives an entire universe of physical data, so each of these other states of consciousness perceive realities as complicated, varied, and vivid. It is for this reason that it is so difficult to explain the experiences possible within any given one. (Long pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>就如你日常的醒时状态，感知到一整个全是物质资料的宇宙，因此，这意识的每个其他状态所感知的实相，是同样的复杂、多变而生动的。为此之故，才这么难解释在任意一个意识层面中可能的经验。(停顿良久。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>A-5 opens up a dimension in which the vital consciousness of any personality can at least theoretically be contacted. This involves communicating not only with past personalities in your terms, but future ones. It is a level of consciousness very seldom reached. It is not, for example, the layer used by most mediums. It is a meeting ground in which personalities from any time or place or probable system can communicate with each other in clear terms understood by all.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>“A-5”打开了一个次元，在其中，至少在理论上来说，能接触任一个人格的生命意识。这牵涉到不仅是与以你们的话来说已过去的“人”沟通，并且与将来的“人”沟通。这是个极少达到的意识层面。比如说，它不是大半的灵媒所用的层面。它是个会面的地方，在其中，由任何时、空、或可能系统来的“人”，都能彼此以大家都清楚了解的方式沟通。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Since past, present, and future do not exist, this is a level of crystal clear communication of consciousness. Those involved have an excellent knowledge of their own backgrounds and histories, of course, but in this state possess also a much larger perspective, in which private and historical backgrounds are seen as a portion of a greater perceivable whole.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>既然过去、现在与将来并不存在，这是个水晶般清明意识沟通的层面。当然，那些涉入其中的人，对他们自己的背景与历史都有极佳的知识，但在这状态，他们还拥有一个广大得多的眼界，在其中，私人与历史的背景被看作是一个更大可知全体的一部分。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:35.) At this level, messages literally flash through the centuries from one great man or woman to another. The future speaks to the past. The great artists have always been able to communicate at this level and while living literally operated at this level of consciousness a good deal of the time. Only the most exterior portions of their personalities bowed to the dictates of historical period.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:35)在这个层面上，讯息真的是闪过数世纪，由一个伟大的人传到另一个。“未来”对“过去”说话。伟大的艺术家一迳都能在这层面上沟通，而当他还活在世上时，他真的有许多时候是在这个层面运作。只有他们人格的最外层部分屈从于历史时期的指挥。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>For those who reach this state and utilize it, communication is clearest. It must be understood that this communication works in both ways. Leonardo da Vinci knew of Picasso, for example. There are great men and women who go unknown. Their contemporaries ignore them. Their achievements may be misunderstood or physically lost, but at this level of consciousness they share in these communications, and at another level of existence their achievements are recognized.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>对那些已达到了这状态并善加利用之人，沟通是最清晰不过的。你们必须了解这种沟通是双向的。举例来说，里奥那多·达芬奇也知道毕加索。有些伟大的男人和女人不为世人所知，他们同代的人忽略了他们，他们的成就也许被误解或实质上失落了，但在意识的这个层面，他们分享这些交流、沟通，而在存在的另一个层面，他们的成就被承认了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I do not mean to imply, however, that only the great share in this communication of consciousness. (Pause.) A great simplicity is necessary, and out of this, many of the most lowly in men’s terms also share in these communications. There is an unending conversation going on throughout the universe, and a most meaningful one. (Long pause.) Those from both your past and your future have a hand in your present world, and at this level the problems that have been met and will be encountered are being discussed. This is the heart of communication. It is most usually encountered either in a protected deep level of sleep or in a sudden spontaneous trance state. Great energy is generated.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，我并不是在暗示只有伟人才能分享这种意识的沟通。(停顿。)到这境界来的人，必须具有一种相当的纯真，因此，在这条件下，许多在人世说来最卑微的人也分享这些沟通。有一个没完没了又最有意义的对话在整个宇宙间进行。(停顿很久。)在你们的过去与未来的人，对你们现在的世界都有所参与，而过去曾遭到和未来会遭到的问题在这层面被讨论。这是沟通之心脏。人们多半是在睡眠的一个被保护的深沉层面，或在一个突然自发的出神状态中接触到这层面。这种接触的发生产生了巨大的能量。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:47. Jane was aware that her pace had been quite slow most of the time. Resume at a faster rate at 10:05.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:47。珍觉察到她的步调在大半的时间里都相当慢。在10:05以较快的方式继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: The information received in any of these states of consciousness must be interpreted for the normal waking consciousness, if any physical memory is to be maintained.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，如果想把在任何这些意识状态里所收到的资讯保持在你记忆里的话，则必须先把它诠释给正常的醒时意识。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In many cases memory remains unconscious as far as waking self is concerned, but the experiences themselves can completely change the structure of an individual life. Disastrous courses can be averted through such inner communications and illuminations, whether or not the ego is aware of them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在许多例子里，就清醒的自己而言，这些记忆仍旧是无意识的，但这经验本身却能完全改变一个人生活的结构。而不论“自我”是否对它们有所觉察，透过这种内在的沟通和启迪，本会招致灾祸的航线能被避开。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The experiences at these various levels may be interpreted symbolically. They may appear in the form of fantasy, fiction, or art work, without the conscious self realizing their origin. Now at any of these various stages of consciousness, other phenomena may also be perceived ---- thought forms for example, energy manifestations, projections from the personal subconscious, and projections from the collective unconscious. Any or all of these may take symbolic form, and may appear beneficial or threatening according to the attitude of the personality involved. They should be regarded as quite natural phenomena, often neutral in intent.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这些个不同层面的经验可能以象征来诠释。它们可能以幻想、小说或艺术作品的方式出现，而有意识的自己并没悟到它们的来源。且说在任何这些意识的不同阶段，其他的现象也能被感知——例如，“心念形象”、能量的展现、来自个人潜意识的投射及来自集体无意识的投射。其中任一个或所有这些皆可能会采取象征的形式，而依据当事人的态度以有益的或威胁性的模样出现。你们应该把它们看成十分自然的现象，其意图常常是中立的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Often they are incipient forms given activity by the personality who encounters them. The nature of their activity, therefore, will be projected outward from the personality onto the relatively passive materialization. The person encountering these has only to turn his attention away to “deactivate” the phenomenon. This does not mean that the phenomenon is not real. Its nature is simply of a different kind and degree.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>通常它们是一种“雏形”(incipient forms)，活动性是由接触到它们的人赋予的。因此，它们活动的性质将是由这人格向外投射到那个相当被动的具体形象上。碰到这些形象的人，只需把他的注意力转开就可以“撤销”(deactivate)这现象。这并不表示这现象不是真实的，只不过它的性质是属于另一类和另一程度。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It has some energy of its own, but needs additional energy from a perceiver for any interrelationship to take place. If such a materialization appears threatening, then simply wish it peace and withdraw your attention from it. It draws its main activating energy from your focusing, and according to the intensity and nature of your focus. You must not take the root assumptions of physical existence with you as you journey through these levels of consciousness. Divest yourself of as many of them as possible, for they can cause you to misinterpret your experiences. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>它自己也有一些能量，但却需要由感知者来的附加能量才能发生任何交互关系。如果这样的一个具体化看起来有威胁性，那你就祝它平安而撤回你对它的注意力就好了。它是由你对它的贯注，并按照你贯注力的强度与性质，汲取其主要的动能。在你旅历过这些意识层面时，你一定不可随身携带着人间的基本假设。尽你可能地把它们舍弃，因为它们能令你误解你的经验。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are other layers of awareness beneath this one, but here there is a much greater tendency for one to merge into the other. In the next level, for example, communication is possible with various kinds of consciousness that have never been physically manifested, in your terms ---- personalities who do not have a physical reality in either your present or future, yet who are connected with your system of reality both as guardians and custodians.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在“A-5”之下，还有一些其他的觉察层面，但在此，有一个层面会并入另一个更大的倾向。例如，在下一个层面，以你的话来说，你可能与从未以肉体化身显现的各种意识相沟通——在你们的现在或未来，这些人格都没有一个物质的实相，但他们却以“守护神”与“监护人”身份与你们的实相系统相连。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Almost all experiences from this level will be symbolically represented, for otherwise they would have no meaning to you. The experiences will all have to do in one way or another with nonphysical life, noncorporeal consciousness and forms, and the independence of consciousness from matter. These experiences will always be supportive. Out-of-body experiences will often be involved here, in which the projectionist finds himself in an unearthly environment or one of great beauty and grandeur.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>几乎所有从这层面来的经验都将以“象征”来代表，因为若非如此，它们对你将毫无意义。这些经验多少都与非物质性的生命、非肉身的意识与形式，以及独立于物质之外的意识有关。这些经验对你永远有支持性。在这儿常常涉及了“出体”的经验，在其中投射者发现自己在一个不同于尘俗或一个极美且壮观的环境里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The “stuff” of the environment will have its origin in the mind of the projectionist, being symbolic of his idea, for example, of life after death. A Speaker or Speakers will appear in whatever guise will be most acceptable to the projectionist, whether it be the guise of a god, an angel or a disciple. This is the most characteristic kind of experience from this level. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>环境里的“东西”都是源自投射者的心，都是他的概念——例如，他对死后生活的概念——的象征。一个或几个“说法者”会以投射者最能接受的任何一种扮相出现，不论是“神明”、“天使”或“使徒”的扮相。这是由此层面而来的经验的最大特征。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>According to the abilities and understanding of the projectionist, however, more thorough messages can be given, and it may be quite obvious that the Speakers are indeed only symbols of greater identities. Some will be able to understand the communications more clearly. The true nature of the nonphysical Speakers may then be made known.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，按照投射者的能力与了解，可给予他更彻底的讯息，可能他能相当明显的看出来，“说法者”的确只是那些更伟大本体的象征。有些人能更清楚地了解这讯息，那么非实体“说法者”的真正本质就能让他晓得。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Deeper projections into that environment may then be possible. In this state also great vistas of historic pasts and futures may be seen. All of these levels of consciousness are filled with the tapestry of various communications that can be followed through according to the purpose of the personality involved.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>于是他可能更深地投射到那环境里。同时在这状态，可看到历史性的过去与未来的伟大景色。所有这些意识层面都充满了各种各类通讯的交织网，而涉足其中的人能照他的目的去追寻其脉络。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:33.) Molecular structures send out their own messages, and unless you are tuned in to perceive them, they may be interpreted as static or meaningless noise. Any one of these levels of consciousness can be covered in a twinkling, and no notice taken of it; or, at least theoretically, you could spend a lifetime exploring any given level.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:33)分子结构散发出它们自己的讯息，但除非你对准了频率去感知它，否则很可能把它们诠释为静电杂音或无意义的噪音。以上所说的这些意识层面的任一个，你都可以在一瞬间通过，而对它没留意；或，至少理论上说，你也可以花掉一辈子的时间探索任一个层面。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may have several quite valid experiences in level four for example, without any awareness of the first three. The stages are there for those who know what they are and how to use them. Many quite spontaneously find their own way. The other adjacent levels on the horizontal line, now, involve you in various alternate realities, each one a greater distance from your own. Many of these involve systems in which life and death as you know it does not occur, where time is felt as weight; systems in which the root assumptions are so different from your own that you would only accept any experiences as fantasy.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如，你可能对前面三层毫不知觉，却在第四层有几次十分确实的经验。对那些知道它们是什么及如何去用它们的人，那些阶段是在那儿的。许多人十分自发地找到他们自己的路。至于在水平方向上的其他邻接层面，使你涉入种种替代的实相，每个跟你自己的离得更远。这些实相中所牵涉到的许多系统，在其中你所知的生与死根本不发生，你感受那儿“时间”像是重量一样；这些系统中的基本假设与你自己的如此不同，以致你只能把任何经验当作幻想来接受。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>For this reason, you are much less apt to travel in those directions. In some there are built-in impediments. Even projection from your universe into a universe of antimatter is most difficult, for example. The electromagnetic makeup even of your thoughts would be adversely affected, and yet theoretically this is possible from one of these adjacent levels of consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>为此之故，你较不易向那些方向旅行。在某些层面里有些天生固有的阻碍。举例来说，由你的宇宙投射到一个反物质宇宙是最困难的。即使你思想的电磁结构也会受到反面的影响，但理论上，从一个这种意识的邻接层面，你却是可能投射过去的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I suggest your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我建议你休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:42. Jane’s trance had been excellent, her delivery faster yet. Resume at 10:55.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:42。珍的出神状态一直极佳，她的传述还更快了。在10:55继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Often you visit such areas of consciousness in the dream state where you fall into them spontaneously, remembering in the morning a fantastic dream. Consciousness must use all of its parts and activities, even as the body must. When you are sleeping, therefore, your consciousness turns itself in many of these directions, often perceiving, willy-nilly, bits and pieces of reality that are available to it at its different stages. This also happens beneath your normal physical focus to some extent, even as you go about your waking activities. The alternate presents of which I spoke are not simply alternate methods of perceiving one objective present. There are many alternate presents, with you focused only in one of them.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>通常你在梦境自动自发地落入而游历这样的意识区域，早上只记起一个奇妙的梦。就如身体一样，意识必须利用它所有的部分与活动。因此，当你在睡觉时，你的意识把自己转向许多这种方向，不管它愿意不愿意，常常感知到它在各不同阶段所能得到的实相之点点滴滴。这多少也在你正常的肉体焦点之下发生，甚至于当你在从事醒时活动时也一样。我所说的交替的现在，并不只是感知一个客观现在种种的方法。有许多交替的现在，而你的注意力只集中在它们之一。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>When you let your attention waver, however, you may often fall into a state in which you momentarily perceive glimpses of another alternate present. The whole self, the soul, knows of its reality in all such systems, and you, as a part of it, are working toward the same state of self-awareness and development.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，当你让你的注意力动摇的时候，你可能常常落入一种状态，在其中你暂时对另一个交替的现在看到几眼。全我——灵魂——知道它在所有这些系统中的实相；而你，作为其一部分，正向着同样的自我觉察与发展的状态努力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>When you are proficient you will not be swept willy-nilly into other stages of consciousness as you sleep, but will be able to understand and direct these activities. Consciousness is an attribute of the soul, a tool that can be turned in many directions. You are not your consciousness. It is something that belongs to you and to the soul. You are learning to use it. To the extent that you understand and utilize the various aspects of consciousness, you will learn to understand your own reality, and the conscious self will truly become conscious.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当你熟练了之后，睡眠时你不会不由自主的被卷进其他的意识阶段，却能了解与指挥这些活动。意识是灵魂的一种属性，一个能被转向许多方向的工具。你不是你的意识，它是某种属于你和你的灵魂的东西，你正在学着用它。依照你对意识各个层面的了解与利用到什么程度，你也将学会了解你自己的实相，而“有意识的你”才会变得真正有意识。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You will be able to perceive physical reality because you want to, knowing it to be one of many realities. You will not be forced to perceive it alone, out of ignorance.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那时你能感知物质实相，是因为你想要感知它，心知它是许多实相之一。你却不因为无知而被迫只单单感知到它。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:02.) End of dictation. Now, you may ask me any questions that you have, or end the session as you prefer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:02)口述完毕。现在可以问我你有的任何问题，或是结束此节。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I hope you’ll cover for your book the question Jane and I were discussing at the supper table this evening, about what you actually see when you’re speaking to a group of people ---- focusing upon each of us as individuals in this time and place.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我希望你在书中谈谈珍和我今晚在晚餐桌上所讨论的问题，关于当你在对一群人说话时——把我们每个人当作在这时空的个体而集中焦点时——你实际上看到什么。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I will see that it is covered for you. My perceptions were dealt with in the earlier chapters of the book, but not in just that way….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我会留意包括这点。我的感知在本书的先前几章谈到过，但不只是以那种方式……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(In the ESP class session of February 9, 1971, Seth gave an excellent account of the particular aspect of his perceptions that I was referring to now. Ever since then I’ve wanted to ask him to say more about this in his own book. Here’s an extract from the class session, which was recorded as usual:</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在1971年2月9日ESP班的赛斯课里，赛斯给了关于他感知的特定面貌的极佳讨论，就是我以下所说到的。自那以后，我一直想请他在他自己的书里对这点多说一些。此地是那次赛斯课录音的节录：</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Now [humorously]: no one asked me what it was like when I go into a trance. To go into a trance is simply to focus intensely in a highly specific area of reality. Therefore, I throw or project a part of what I am here because I am able to utilize greater areas of my personality than those with which you are now acquainted in yourselves. I can do this in a conscious manner, and yet still, as I have mentioned, when I am here I find a difficulty in looking at you and relating to the selves that you think you are within your given moment of time; for I see the composites. So it takes some training on my part to pinpoint you in the time and space with which you are acquainted.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好〔幽默地〕：没人问我当我进入出神状态是什么样子。进入一个出神状态，只是强烈地把焦点集中在实相的一个非常明确的区域。因此，我把我之为我的一部分抛掷或投射到此，因为我能利用‘我的人格’的范围，远大过你能利用的范围。我能有意识地这样做，但如我提到过的，当我在这儿时，我却仍觉得很难对着你看而与你在这一刻里认为的‘你自己’建立关系；因为我看到的是‘复合体’。因此我需要某种训练，才能瞄准在你所熟知的时空里的你。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“You are aware of the selves that sit in this room on a particular evening of a snowstorm, with certain members of the class present, certain members absent, and with some new people here. I am familiar with the inner portions of your selves that you also know, however, but that the egotistical self has hidden from you, and so I must think constantly to myself: ‘Oh, yes, our Lady of Venice [Seth’s affectionate term for a class member] thinks that she sits in this specific room at this specific hour, and is wearing a blue outfit.’</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“你们觉察到的是在某个暴风雪晚上坐在这房间里的自己，而班上有些人在场，有些人缺席，还有些新人在此。可是我却对你们自己的那些内在部分熟悉，你也知道它，但自我性的自己把它藏而不露，因此我必须经常的提醒自己：‘哦，对了，我们的威尼斯女士〔赛斯对一学员的昵称〕认为她在这特定的小时坐在这特定的房间里，穿着一件蓝衣裳。’</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“But I am aware of a Lady of Venice, you see, in several different manifestations in various existences, all occurring at once. I must remember that she is not aware of these, and when I speak to her I must use a designation that will make sense to her at this particular time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“但你要知道，我却觉察到在几个不同存在里的几个不同样子的威尼斯女士，全都在同时发生。我必须记住她并未知觉到这些，而当我对她说话时，我必须用在这特殊时刻对她说来合理的一个称呼。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“To some extent, I serve as a communicator from one level of your selves to other levels of your selves, for I remind you of what you are. You have been much given to thoughts of death this evening. Now, I have been a very lively corpse many times; but then, so have you all. The inner portions of your selves know this well. You have walked away from more graves than you can remember ---- and will indeed, many of you, walk away from more. Why, then, do you worry about justifying your own existence in this hour?”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“到某个程度，我就像是由你自己的一个层面到其他层面的一个沟通者，因为我提醒你，你是什么。今晚你们花了很多时间沉溺在对‘死亡’的思虑里。说起来，我倒有好多次是个非常有生气的尸体；然则，你们也都一样。你自己的内在部分对这点知道得很清楚。你由坟墓走开的次数多得你都记不清——你们之中很多人还的确将由更多的坟墓走开。那么，你为何还要在这个时刻去操心要将你自己的存在合理化？”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth’s delivery now speeded up considerably, and we exchanged views on the subject just quoted in a lively manner. I made no effort to record the conversation.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯的传述现在快了不少，而我们热烈地就刚才所引述的主题交换看法。我并没试着记录这段对话。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I am sure you will like my book when you read it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我确信当你读我的书时会喜欢它。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I like it now.” After another short exchange):</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“我现在就喜欢它。”在我们又交谈了几句之后：)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now I will bid you a fond good evening….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在我要向你道晚安……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good night, Seth, and thank you very much.” 11:05 P.M.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。非常感谢你。”11:05。)</a>
