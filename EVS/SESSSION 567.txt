<a id=1 href=1>1971年2月15日 星期一 晚上9：19</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(For the last two weeks we have been busy with affairs related to the recent death of my father.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(上两周我们忙着我父亲的后事。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: For a change we are going to have some dictation, though I may make a few remarks at the end of our session to you both.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：我们要换换样子写写书，虽然在课结束时我可能会对你俩说几句。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Dictation then: Probabilities are an ever-present portion of your invisible psychological environment. You exist in the middle of the probable system of reality. It is not something apart from you. To some extent it is like a sea in which you have your present being. You are in it, and it is in you. Occasionally at surface levels of consciousness, you might wonder what might have happened had you made other decisions than those you have; chosen different mates, for example, or taken up residence in other portions of the country. You might wonder what would have happened had you mailed an important letter that you subsequently decided not to mail; and in such small wonderings only, have you ever questioned the nature of Probabilities. But there are deep connections between yourself and all those individuals with whom you have had relationships, and with whom you were involved in deep decisions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么开始口述：可能性是你看不见的心理环境的一个一直存在的部分。你就生存于可能的实相系统中，它不是个与你分开的什么东西。到某个程度来说，它就像是你目前活在其中的一个大海，你在它之内而它在你之内。偶尔你会在意识的表层上臆想，如果你做的是别的决定，而非你曾做的决定，那事情又会如何演变呢？好比说，选择不同的配偶，或在另外一个地方住下来的话。你可能猜测，如果你寄出了那封后来决定不寄的重要信，结果又如何？而只有在这种小小的臆测里，你才曾质疑过可能性的本质。但在你和所有与你有过关系的人，以及在做重大的决定时所涉及的人之间，有很深的关联存在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:28.) These are not nebulous. They are profound psychological interconnections that bind you each to each, particularly in a telepathic framework, though this may be beneath normal consciousness. The unrealized physical connections that might have occurred, but did not, are worked out in other layers of reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:28)这些关联并不是如星云般模糊的，它们是把你们一个个绑在一起的极深奥心理上的交互联系，尤其是存在于一个心电感应式的架构里，虽然这可能是在正常意识之下。可能发生却未实现的实质联系在实相的其他层面完成了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The invisible environment within your mind is not as lonely as you might think, and your seeming inner isolation is caused by the ego’s persistent guard. It sees no reason, for example, why you should be informed of information that it does not consider pertinent to day-by-day daily activity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你心中的隐形环境并非如你以为的那么寂寞，而你内在彷佛有的孤立感，是由自我的固执防卫而生。例如，它看不出有什么理由要让你知道，那些它认为与日复一日的日常活动无关的资讯。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:31.) I do not like the phrase, “to advance”, yet in your terms “to advance” as a consciousness is to become more and more aware of these other materializations of your own identity. The probable selves are to gain awareness of the other probable selves, and realize that all are various manifestations of the true identity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:31)我不喜欢“求进步”这句话，然而以你们来说，作为一个意识，“进步”就是变得越来越知觉到你自己本体的那些其他的具体化。可能的自己就是要获知其他可能的自已，而了悟到所有的都是“真正本体”之种种不同的显现。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>They are not “lost”, buried or negated in some superself, without free will, self-determination, or individuality. Instead the identity is what they are, with full freedom to express all probable actions and developments, both in this reality and in others that you do not know.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这些“可能的自己”并没在某个超我中“迷失”、埋葬或被否定，没有自由意志、自主性或个人性。反之，本体就是他们，有完全的自由去表达所有的可能行动与发展，不但在这实相里，也在其他你所不知的实相里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>As you sit reading this book in your present moment of time, you are positioned in the center of a cosmic web of Probabilities that is affected by your slightestmental or emotional act.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当你在目前这一刻坐着读这本书时，你正处于一个“可能性”的宇宙之网中央，而你最微细的精神或情感行动都会影响它。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:36.) Your thoughts and feelings, therefore, go forth from you not only in all physical directions but in directions that are quite invisible to you, appearing in dimensions that you would not presently understand. Now you are also the receiver of other such signals coming from other Probabilities that are connected with your own, but you choose which of those probable actions you want to make real or physical in your system, as others also have the freedom of choice in their systems.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:36停顿。)因此，你的思想与情感由你向所有的——不止是物质界的也包括看不见的——方向发射出去，而出现在你目前还不了解的次元里。且说你同时也接收到由其他与你相连的可能性里来的这种信号，但由你选择在那些可能行动之中，你要使哪一个成真，或使它在你的系统里实现，就如其他人在他们的系统里也有选择的自由。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You originate ideas then and receive them, but you are not forced to actualize unrealized probable acts that come to you from other probable selves. Now there is a natural attraction between yourself and other probable selves, electromagnetic connections having to do with simultaneous propulsions of energy. By this I mean energy that appears simultaneously both to you and probable selves in other realities; psychic connections having to do with a uniting, sympathetic, emotional reaction and a connection that shows up very strongly in the dream state.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，你发出概念，也收到概念，但你并没有被迫去实现那些由其他可能自己而来的未实现的可能行为。且说，在你自己与其他可能的自己之间，有种自然的吸引力，与能量同时推进有关的电磁性关联。我这是指对你和在其他实相中可能的你同时出现的能量；在所有的“你”之间有一种心灵上的关系，彼此有一种统一的、交感的、情感上的反应，这种联系在梦境中非常明显。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In that state, with the functions of the ego somewhat stilled, there is some considerable communication between various portions of the entire identity. In dreams you may have glimpses of probable roads that you might have taken. You may think that these are fantasy, but instead you may be perceiving a legitimate picture of events that did occur within another system of Probabilities.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在那种状况下，自我的机能较为静止，在整个本体的各个不同部分之间，于是便有相当多的沟通。在梦中，你会对你本来也许会选择的可能路子看到一眼。也许你以为这些只是幻想，其实你也许正在看，确实在另一可能系统里发生了的那些事件之一个合理画面。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now you may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:45. Jane was surprised at the “little” amount of material delivered. She said she thought she’d “really been flying,” with some great new material. Resume at 10:00.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:45。珍对只说了这么“一丁点”资料感到惊讶，她说她以为她“滔滔不绝”地说出了些伟大的新资料呢！在10:00继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: One event can be actualized by more than one probable self, however, and you will resemble some probable selves more than others. Because you are involved in an intricate psychological gestalt such as this, and because the connections mentioned earlier do exist, you can avail yourself to some extent of abilities and knowledge possessed by these other probable portions of your personality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>然而，一件事可以被不止一个可能的自己所实现，而你会与某些可能的自己比另一些更相像。因为你涉身于像这样复杂的一个“心理的完形”里，又因先前我说过确实存在的心灵联系，你能借用一些你人格的这些可能部分的才能与知识。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The connections make for quite constant “bleed-throughs.” Once you are aware of the probable system, however, you will also learn to become alert to what I will here call “benign intrusive impulses.” Such impulses would seem to be disconnected from your own current interests or activities; intrusive in that they come quickly into consciousness, with a sense of strangeness as if they are not your own. These can often offer clues of various kinds. You may know absolutely nothing about music, for example, and one afternoon while in the middle of some mundane activity be struck by a sudden impulse to buy a violin.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那种联系造成了相当持续不断的“渗漏”。不过，一旦你知觉到可能的系统，你也就学会对我在此称之为“善意的侵入性冲动”有所警觉。这种冲动看似与你自己目前的兴趣或活动不相连；“侵入性”是因为它们很快地进入意识，带来一种陌生感，好像它们不是你自己的。这些事常能给我们各种线索，比如说，你可能对音乐一窍不通，而某个午后你正在处理俗务时，却突然有去买一把小提琴的冲动。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:06.) Such an impulse could be an indication that another probable portion of your identity is gifted with that instrument. I am not telling you to run off and buy one, but you could however act on the impulse as far as is reasonably possible ---- renting a violin, simply acquainting yourself with violin concerti, etc.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:06停顿。)这样一个冲动可能表示，本体另一个可能的部分对那种乐器有天赋。我并没叫你跑出去买一把小提琴，但无论如何你却可以在合理的可能范围内，把这个冲动付诸行动——租一把小提琴，或只是让你自己对小提琴协奏曲熟习一些等等。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You would learn the instrument far quicker, you see, if the impulse was originating with a probable self. It goes without saying then that probable selves exist in your “future” as well as your past. It is very poor policy to dwell negatively on unpleasant aspects of the past that you know, because some portions of the probable self may still be involved in that past. The concentration can allow greater bleed-through and adverse identification, because that part will be one background that you have in common with any probable selves who sprang from that particular source.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>要知道，如果这冲动是来自一个可能的自己，你会更快地学会这乐器。那么不用说，可能的自己当然也存在于你的“将来”，如同存在于你的过去一样。沉缅于你过去的不愉快里是非常不智之事，因为可能自己的部分或许仍卷入在那个过去里。对过去集中注意可能会有更多的“渗漏”与不利的认同，因为那个“过去”，是你和由那特定源头跃出的任何可能自己的一个“共同背景”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:12.) To dwell upon the possibility of illness or disaster is equally poor policy, for you set up negative webs of Probabilities that need not occur. You can theoretically alter your own past as you have known it, for time is no more something divorced from you than Probabilities are.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:12)沉缅于可能会发生疾病或灾祸的念头里也是同样的不智，因为你布下了负面的可能性之网，那本来是不必发生的。理论上你可以改变你所知的“自己的过去”，因为与可能性一样，时间也不是什么与你分开的东西。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The past existed in multitudinous ways. You only experienced one probable past. By changing this past in your mind, now, in your present, you can change not only its nature but its effect, and not only upon yourself but upon others.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>过去以多种方式存在着，而你只经验到一个可能的过去。借着在“现在”从你的心中改变这过去，你不只能改变它的性质，也还能改变不只是它对你的影响，还有它对别人的影响。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Pretend a particular event happened that greatly disturbed you. In your mind imagine it not simply wiped out, but replaced by another event of more beneficial nature. Now this must be done with great vividness and emotional validity, and many times. It is not a self-deception. The event that you choose will automatically be a probable event, which did in fact happen, though it is not the event you chose to perceive in your given probable past.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>假设发生了某一特定事件令你非常困扰。那么就在你心中想象，不仅它被抹去，并且以一件本质上更有益的事件来取代之。现在这个想象必须要非常的栩栩如生，在情感上有确实的感受，而且要反复的观想。这并非自欺。你所选择去想象的事件会自动地是个可能事件，也确实发生了，虽然不是你在你“可能的过去”所选择感知的那个事件。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:24.) Telepathically, if the process is done correctly, your idea will also affect any people who were connected with the original event, though they can choose to reject as well as accept your version.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:24)如果这过程做得正确，你的念头也会心电感应地影响任何与原事件有关的人，虽然他们可选择拒斥或接受你的这个新版本。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This is not a book on techniques, so I will not go into this particular method deeply, but merely mention it here. Remember, however, that in a most legitimate way many events that are not physically perceived or experienced are as valid as those that are, and are as real within your own invisible psychological environment.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这不是一本谈技术的书，因此我不去深入的谈这个特定的方法，只在这儿提提。不过，要记住，以一种最合法的方式来说，许多没有在物质层面上感知或经验到的事件，与真正感知与经验到的一样有效而且有意义，在你自己看不见的心理环境里也一样的真实不虚。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are in your terms, then, unlimited probable future events for which you are now setting groundworks. The nature of the thoughts and feelings you originate and those that you habitually or characteristically receive set a pattern, so you will choose from those probable futures those events that will physically become your experience. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>于是，以你们的话来说，你现在就在为无限量的将来可能事件铺路。源自于你的那些思想、情感的性质，以及你依照你的习惯或特征而收到的那些思想与情感的性质会建立起一个模式，从而你会由那些可能的未来中选择某些事件，而让它们实际上变成你未来的经验。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Because there are bleed-throughs and interconnections, it is possible for you to tune into a “future event,” say of an unfortunate nature, an event for which you are headed if you continue on your present course. A dream about it, for instance, may so frighten you that you avoid the event and do not experience it. If so, such a dream is a message from a probable self who did experience the event.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因为在各个“可能的自己”之间彼此有“渗漏”与交互关联，调准到“未来的事件”对你而言是可能的。假设有一件不幸的事，如果你继续现在的方向便会碰上。举例来说，你可能做了一个关于那事的梦而吓得要死，结果使你避过了那事而并没经历它。如果是如此的话，这样的一个梦乃是由确实已经历此事的一个可能自己那儿来的信息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:30.) So can a child then in a dream receive such communications from a probable future self, of such a nature that its life is completely changed. The entire identity is being now. All divisions are merely illusion s, so one probable self can hold out a helping hand to another, and through these inner communications the various probable selves in your terms begin to understand the nature of their identity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:30)那么，一个孩子因此可能在一个梦里收到由可能的未来自己送来的讯息，这讯息具有这样一种性质，以致完全改变了他的一生。整个的本体“当下”就存在，所有的划分只是幻觉，因此一个可能的自己能对另一个伸出援手，而经由这些内在沟通，你们所谓各个可能的自己于是开始了解他们的本体本质是什么。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now this leads to other adventures in which whole civilizations may be involved, for as individuals have their probable destinies, so do civilizations, nations, and inhabited planetary systems. Your historical earth as you know it has developed in many different ways, and there is a deeply unconscious connection that unites all such manifestations.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在这把我们引到了其他的探险，牵涉到整个的文明，就如个人有他们可能的命运，因此文明、国家或有居民的行星系统也一样。你所知的你们历史上的地球曾经有许多不同方面的发展，而有一个深深的无意识层面的联系来统合所有这种“示现”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In their own way, even atoms and molecules retain a knowledge of the forms through which they have passed, and so the individuals that compose any given civilization contain deep within themselves the inner knowledge of experiments and trials, successes and failures, in which the races have also been involved at other levels of reality. You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>以它们自己的方式，即使原子和分子也对它们所曾经历过的种种形式保留了记忆，因而组成任一个文明的个人，在他们自己的内心深处，也都保留了对这民族过去在实相的另一层面时所涉及的实验与试炼、成功与失败的内在知识。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:39 to 10:55.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:39—10:55)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In some probable realities, Christianity as you know it did not flourish. In some, males did not dominate. In others the makeup of physical matter simply followed different lines. Now all of these Probabilities are in the air about you, so to speak, and I describe them as faithfully as I can, but I must relate them with concepts with which you are somewhat familiar. To some extent, then, the “truth” must be sifted through your own conceptual patterns in order for you to comprehend it at all.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在某些可能的实相，如你们所知的基督教并没有盛行。在有一些里，男性并没做过主。在另一些里，物体的构成根本遵循着不同的路径。其实所有这些可能性就在你们四周的空气里，可以这么说，而我尽可能忠实地描写它们，但我必须以你们多少熟悉的观念去谈。那么到某个程度，“真理”必须被滤过你自己观念的模式，你才有希望了解它。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Suffice it to say, you are surrounded by other influences and events. Certain of these you perceive in your three-dimensional reality. You accept them as real without realizing that they are only portions of other events. Where your vision fails, you think reality ceases, so again you must train yourselves to look between events, between objects, within yourself when you do not seem to be doing anything. Watch out for events that appear to make no sense, for they are often clues to larger invisible events.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>只这样说就够了：你是被其他的影响和事件所包围的。在这些里面，有某些是你在三次元的实相里感知到的，你把它们当作是真的来接受，而没了悟它们只是其他事件的一部分。在你的视野看不见的地方，你以为实相也终止了。因此，我再说一次，当你无事时，你必须训练自己在事件与事件之间、物体与物体之间检视，并且向内看看自己。特别要留心那看似没道理的事，因为它们常常是你看不到的较大事件的线索。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>End of dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>口述结束。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Seth then briefly answered a couple of personal questions.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(赛斯于是短暂地回答了两个私人的问题。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>So, if you have no more questions or comments… (I shook my head.) I intend to finish this chapter on Wednesday. My heartiest good wishes and a fond good evening, and when we get settled we will start on you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，如果你没有别的问题或评论……(我摇摇头。)我想在星期三结束这章。我最衷心的祝福及一个美好的晚上，当我们弄好了，我们就会谈谈你的事。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Okay. Thank you very much, Seth. Good night.” 11:06 P.M.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的，非常谢谢你。晚安赛斯。”11:06。)</a>
