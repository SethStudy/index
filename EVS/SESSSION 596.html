<div style="display:inline">1971年9月27日 星期一 晚9：24</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>SEPTEMBER 27, 1971, 9:24 P.M. MONDAY</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(晚饭后，珍和我为赛斯书做了一小时左右的校对工作，然后出去散步。是个温暖有雨的秋夜，天已黑了，非常的惬意。四处散布着潮湿的落叶。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane and I worked on proofreading Seth’s book for an hour or so after supper, and then went for a walk. lt was a warm and rainy fall evening, already dark and very pleasant. There was a scattering of wet fallen leaves about.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(到8:30我们已回到家。我们坐在客厅里没开灯，因而我们可以很容易地看清外面。今天珍写完了赛斯书的序。这又让她想到她自己的手稿——“物质宇宙即意念结构” ——她在序中谈到的。她今天又读了一遍那篇稿子，仍然觉得极有兴趣，她再一次说，终有一天她自己会把它发挥一下的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(By 8:30 we were back home. We sat in the living room with the lights off, so that we could see outside easily. Jane had finished the Introduction to Seth’s book today. This in turn reminded her of her own manuscript, The Physical Universe As idea construction, which she discusses in the Introduction. She had read it again today, and it still intrigues her. She said again that she’d like to do something with it on her own eventually.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在我们谈话时不知不觉已过了九点。当我们终于准备开始上课时，我开了两个灯。珍想为赛斯书的附录要更多资料。她说今晚客厅看起来似乎“不同”，意味颇深长，但她又说是个“很好的不同”。她开始以一种非常安静的声音为赛斯说话。她的步调颇慢，她的双眼常常闭着。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:00 passed almost unnoticed as we talked. I turned on a couple of lights when we finally got down to the business of holding a session. Jane wanted more material for the Appendix of Seth’s book. She said that the living room seemed “different” this evening, significant; but it was a “nice difference,” she added. She began speaking for Seth in a very quiet voice. Her pace was rather slow, her eyes closed often.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">鲁柏在他的序里所提到的物质宇宙即意念结构，的确代表了我们第一次正式的接触，虽然鲁柏在那时并不知道这回事。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: The Physical Universe as idea construction, mentioned by Ruburt in his Introduction, did indeed represent our first formal contact, although Ruburt was not aware of it at that time.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那经验发生在一个他能接受的架构里——也就是高度加速了的灵感。只有当他在经历对他而言仿佛几乎不可忍受的那么强的灵感之后，他的意识才离开了他的身体。如果反之他的习惯是把他导向，比如说，一般的祈祷的话，那么那个架构也可能为他所用。在所有这种例子里，有几种特质是很明显的：内省的能力、深度集中的能力、在沉思中以肉体为取向的自己失去了锋利棱角的能力，以及一种强烈的学习欲望。这些必须伴以内在信念，相信能直接收到适切的知识。对那些相信所有的答案都已知的人，就没有什么探索的必要了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The experience came within a framework that he could accept ---- that of highly accelerated inspiration. His consciousness left his body only after he was in the throes of what seemed to him to be inspiration of almost unbearable intensity. Had his habits instead led him, say, to regular prayer, then that framework could also have been used. In all such cases several qualities are apparent: an ability to look inward, to concentrate deeply, to lose the sharp edges of the physically oriented self in contemplation, and an intense desire to learn. These must be coupled with the inner confidence that pertinent knowledge can be directly received. To those who believe that all answers are known, there is little need to search.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这种资讯，这种由灵感触发的写作，通常是出现在已被固定成形的人格架构内。因此这种知识出现于其中的那个范畴常常会有所不同。在有些情形，这架构本身是最后一次被用到，而最初由灵感而得的知识——这知识本身——脱离了这架构，而超出了让它出生的那范畴之外。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Such information, such inspired writing, usually appears within frameworks of the personality that have already been set and formed. The context in which such knowledge appears will often vary, therefore. In some cases, the framework itself is used for a final time, with the initial inspired knowledge ---- the knowledge itself ---- escaping from the framework and growing out of the context that allowed for its birth.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在9:35停顿，许多停顿之一。不过，珍的传述到现在却更有力了。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 9:35, one of many. Jane’s delivery was more vigorous by now, however.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">最重要的是，在意识的扩展状态收到这种资讯的那些个人，已经在他们自己内在感觉到他们不止与地球本身，并且还与更深的实相有深深的联系。在有意识的层面，他们常不觉察这个在他们自己内在的基本特质。但他们不接受别人所给的答案，却坚持找他们自己的答案。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Above all, individuals who receive such information in states of expanded consciousness are already those who feel deeply within themselves connections not only with the earth itself, but with deeper realities. Consciously they may often be unaware of this basic quality within themselves. They do not accept answers given by others, but insist upon finding their own.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这些寻求也许显得不稳定。有一种微妙的不耐，一种神圣的不满，驱策他们向前，直到在他们自己人格内的边疆终于被打开。所获得的知识然后必须被这具肉身的人格所整合，但是，这种样子的有效知识，天生就会放出它的光而开出它自己的路。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>These searches may appear erratic. There is a fine impatience, a divine discontent that drives them on until the frontiers within their own personalities are finally opened. The knowledge gained must then be integrated by the physical personality, and yet by its nature, valid knowledge of this kind will shed out its light and make its own way.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">由某些这种经验所发动的能量，足以在一瞬间改变自己的一生，并且还能影响其他人的了解和行为。这是一个活动次元的知识侵入了另一次元。它们是能量很高而易变的。收到这种资讯的人本身是它的一部分而不自知。他现在人格的整个“感觉基调”(feeling-tone)，也直接地被他所收到的资讯改变了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The energy generated by some such experiences is enough to change a life in a matter of moments, and to affect the understanding and behavior of others. These are intrusions of knowledge from one dimension of activity to another. They are highly charged and volatile. Unknowingly, the individual who receives such information is himself a part of it. The entire feeling-tone of his present personality is changed ---- and directly ---- by the information he receives.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">按他对自己的“愿景”(vision)忠实到什么程度，他能得到千载难逢的扩展可能性。可是，他得到的资讯常常是与他先前持有的概念相冲突的。否则的话，这种经验有时具爆炸性、侵略性的特质就没有必要了，因为就不会有阻碍了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>To the extent that he is true to his own vision, possibilities of expansion are available to him that he could hardly have achieved otherwise. Often the information given clashes with previously held ideas and beliefs, however. Otherwise, there would be no need for the sometimes explosive, intrusive qualities of such experiences, for there would be no barriers.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在9:45长长的停顿。)然后这种人格就常常必须学着融会他的直觉知识，学着改造知性的架构，使它强到能支持他的直觉知识。这种人格也常天生就有汲取不寻常的大量能量的能力，他们通常在一个相当年轻的时候就得学会不浪费精力。举例来说，在学到了这教训之前，他们可以看起来好像是同时向许多方向进行。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Long pause at 9:45.) Such personalities often then must learn to correlate their intuitive knowledge, to reform intellectual frameworks strong enough to support it. Such personalities also are usually gifted with the ability to draw upon unusual amounts of energy. Often they must learn at a fairly young age not to dissipate the energy. They can seem, for example, to go off in many directions at once, before this lesson is brought home.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">三十几四十出头的人常常会卷入这种事，只因在那时，这种人格“想知道的需要”常常到达了顶峰。所需的行为模式已充分建立，精力也被导向了一定的方向，而这个人已有足够时间去了悟那些被普遍接受的架构与答案对他没有多少意义。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The late thirties and early forties are frequently involved simply because the need to know in such personalities often reaches a peak then. The required patterns of behavior are sufficiently set. The energy has been directed, and the individual has had enough time to realize that the accepted frameworks and answers make little sense to him.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这种经验在它们最强的时候，能从私人的领域把直觉知识推出来以改变文明。那不可置信的能量永远是在最初的经验里，在它内含有浓缩的能量，所有其他的发展都由之而来。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>At their strongest, such experiences can propel intuitive knowledge from the private domain to change civilization. The incredible charge is always in the initial experience. Contained within it is the condensed energy from which all other developments come.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">涉足其中的人能以许多方式反应。他必须经过很大的调整，还常常有行为上的改变。这人现在领悟到，他的确是一个活生生的各种实相交织成的网，而这变成了直接有意识的知识。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The personality involved can react in many ways. Great adjustments are necessary, and often changes of behavior. The individual now realizes that he is indeed a living web of reality, and this becomes immediate conscious knowledge.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(这当然正是发生在珍身上的事。在9:58停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(This of course, is what happened to Jane. Pause at 9:58.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这种知识不仅需要更敏于反应也更负责任的行为，并且还牵涉到先前可能缺乏的一种悲天悯人之心。这种悲悯带来一种强烈、挑战性与热烈的敏锐性。许多人曾感觉经验过不寻常而十分正当又强烈的意识扩展，但却发现他们自己无法把新知与过去的信念连起来，以造成处理这敏感性所必须的改变。的确，他们不够坚强来容纳这经验。在这种情形，他们试着把它关掉、否认、忘记它。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Such knowledge requires not only more responsive and responsible behavior, but involves a sympathy with life that may earlier have been lacking. The sympathy brings with it a sensitivity that is strong, challenging and intense. Many individuals have experienced unusual, quite valid and intense expansions of consciousness, but found themselves unable to correlate the new knowledge with past beliefs, to make the changes necessary to handle the sensitivity. Indeed, they were not strong enough to contain the experience. In such cases, they tried to close it off, deny it, forget it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:05)另一些人则从不允许它逃出它所源自的范畴或架构，于是他们无法脱逃、无法释放自己。举例来说，如果这资讯最先由他们的“神”而来，他们就继续以他们特定的方式来想“神”，即使这经验与所给的资讯应早已把他们带得远远超越了这样的一点。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:05.) Others never allowed it to escape from the framework or the context from which it had sprung. They were then unable to escape. They could not free themselves. If the information seemed to be coming initially from their God, for example, they continued to think in their particular way about God, even though the experience and the information given should have brought them far beyond such a point.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在珍为赛斯说话时，她的声音仍相当安静，但她的传递现在更快更热烈了，她用了许多手势。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane’s voice was still relatively quiet as she spoke for Seth, but her delivery was faster and much more intense now, and she used many gestures.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">举例来说，鲁柏也可能造成同样的错误，要不是他的经验已把他带得超越了那促使它诞生的灵感架构的话。(停顿。)那么，在他的情形，他被推进到新的观念里，因为他有排斥旧观念的见识，以及向前进的勇气。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Ruburt, for example, would have made the same error had he not been led by his experience beyond the framework of inspiration that had given it birth. (Pause.) In his case, then, he was propelled into new concepts because he had the sense to reject old ones, and the courage to go ahead.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这向前进使他涉入了(长久的停顿)我对“神的观念”的想法。在我们开课之前，他是如此地幻灭，以致他甚至不愿考虑任何有关“宗教事务”的问题。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The going-ahead involved him (long pause) with my ideas of the god concept. Before our sessions, he was so disillusion ed that he would not even consider any questions dealing with “religious matter.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(对我：)你累了吗？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(To me): Are you tired?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(我们一直都没休息过，但我摇头表示不累。现在雨下得很大。除了那声音之外，我还听见有人在我们上面的公寓走来走去。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(We hadn’t had a break yet, but I nodded no. It was raining harder now. Along with that sound, I had been hearing someone move back and forth in the apartment above us.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">其实这种经验或这种通到知识的门户是每个人都可获得的，而且每个个人都或多或少参与其间。它们以远非如此明显的方式出现，常是在似乎突然作成的直觉决定、有益的改变、直觉的预感里。常常，在人生的中途，一个人好像突然以一种具体的方式清楚地看见事情的端倪，而把他的事整顿好。例如，看起来似乎朝着灾难走的一生突然“反败为胜”。这些全是同一经验的变奏，虽然是以较不明显的形式。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now such experiences or such doorways to knowledge are available to each individual, and to some extent each individual partakes in them. They appear in much less conspicuous form, often in intuitive decisions made with seeming suddenness, beneficial changes, intuitive hunches. Often midway in life an individual will suddenly seem to see things clearly in a physical manner, straightening out his affairs. A life that seems headed for disaster will suddenly become victorious, for example. These are all variations of the same experience, though in lesser form.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在10:15停顿。)在正常生活与日复一日的经验里，你可得到所有你需要的知识。不过，你必须相信是如此，以“向内看”以及“对你的直觉开放”，把你自己放在一个能收到它的地位，而最要紧的还是想收到它的欲望。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 10:15.) In normal living and in day-by-day experience, all the knowledge you need is available. You must, however, believe that it is, put yourself in a position to receive it by looking inward and remaining open to your intuitions, and most important, by desiring to receive it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在几段以前我说起，像鲁柏这种人，他们自身就是他们收到知识的一部分。这适用于每个人，每个读者。(停顿很久。)有一个很大的错误在世上运作：人们相信只有一项伟大的真理，它将出现而他们就会知道它。但一朵花即一真理，一个灯泡也是，一个白痴及一个天才、一个茶杯及一只蚂蚁也是。可是，在外表他们却少有相似之处。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I said a few paragraphs back that individuals such as Ruburt are themselves a portion of the knowledge they receive. This applies to each person, each reader. (Long pause.) There is a great fallacy operating. People believe that there is one great truth, that it will appear and they will know it. Now a flower is a truth. So is a lamp bulb. So is an idiot and a genius, a glass and an ant. There is little exterior similarity, however.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:24)真理即所有这些看似独特的、分开的、不同的实相。因此鲁柏是他所感知真理的一部分，你们每个人是你们所感知真理的一部分。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:24.) Truth is all of these seemingly distinct, separate, different realities. So Ruburt is a part of the truth he perceives, and each of you are part of the truths that you perceive.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">“真理”经鲁柏反映出来，而在某种方式变成了新的真理，因为它是被独特地感知到的(就如对每个感知到它的人来说，它都是独特的)。那样说的话，它不是更差的真理或更真的真理，它变成了新的真理。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>“Truth,” reflected through Ruburt, becomes in a way new truth, for it is perceived uniquely, (as it would be for each individual who perceived it). It is not less truth or more truth in those terms. It becomes new truth.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在你可以休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now you may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:26，珍花了几分钟才离开出神状态。她的声音在大半时候保持安静，但已变成非常热烈。她完全不知道她已说了超过一小时的话。她说：“哇，他这回真的让我出去了。我也知道为什么。楼上的噪音开始令我心烦，因此赛斯把我放得甚至更深些。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:26. It took Jane a few minutes to come out of a very deep trance. Her voice had remained quiet for the most part, but had become very intent. She had no idea that she’d been speaking for just over an hour. “Wow, he sure had me out that time,” she said. “I know why, too. The noise upstairs really began to bother me, so Seth put me under even deeper.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“然而我知道我会为附录得到一些谈《意念结构》的东西。”她继续道，“真是个愉快的晚上。”她对这节感到非常快乐。我认为她今晚对噪音很敏感，是因为她不想在获得这特殊资料时受到干扰，现在楼上的公寓安静了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“I knew I was going to get something on idea construction for the Appendix, though,” she continued. “It’s been a most enjoyable evening.” She was very happy about the session. I thought she was sensitive to noise tonight because she didn’t want to be interrupted while getting this particular material. The upstairs apartment was quiet now.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(深度出神状态的效果仍留连着，珍一再地打哈欠。她在房里走来走去，啜饮一罐啤酒并吸了一支烟。暖雨继续下着。我问珍是否想结束此节，但她选择继续下去，尽管她哈欠连连。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(The effects of the deep trance lingered. Jane yawned again and again. She walked about the room, sipping a beer and smoking a cigarette. The warm rain continued. I asked Jane if she wanted to end the session, but she chose to continue in spite of her yawns.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在10:45以同样方式继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Resume in the same manner at 10:45.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这种“新真理”的确仍可以是非常古老的，但真理并不是一样必须永远有同样外表、形状、形式或大小的东西。因此，那些执着地保护他们真理不被质疑的人，反而冒了毁坏他们知识合法性的险。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Such “new truths” can still be very ancient indeed, but truth is not a thing that must always have the same appearance, shape, form, or dimension. Those who persist, therefore, in shielding their truths from questions threaten to destroy the validity of their knowledge.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">再次的，那些对他们的答案如此确信无疑的人，将会缺乏那可引导他们进入更大了解次元的“想知道的需要”。当然，任何合法的意识扩展其本身即为讯息的一部分。这人格发现它本身接触到活生生的真理，就明白真理只以那种方式存在。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Again, those who are so certain of their answers will lack that need to know that can lead them into still greater dimensions of understanding. Any valid expansion of consciousness is itself, of course, a part of the message. The personality finds itself encountering living truth, and knows that truth only exists in those terms.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我用了“意识扩展”这用语而非更常用的“宇宙意识”(停顿)，因为后者暗示了在此时人类尚不可得的那么大的经验。(停顿。)与你们的正常状态对比之下，强烈的意识扩展其本质上也许显得是宇宙性的，但它们仅只略微暗示了你们现在可能达到的那些意识状态而已，更别说能开始接近一个真正宇宙性的觉察了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I have used the term “expansion of consciousness” here rather than the more frequently used “cosmic consciousness” (pause), because the latter implies an experience of proportions not available to mankind at this time. (Pause.) Intense expansions of consciousness by contrast to your normal state may appear to be cosmic in nature, but they barely hint at those possibilities of consciousness that are available to you now, much less begin to approach a true cosmic awareness.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:55)在本书中所提出的概念，应该可容许很多读者扩展他们的感知与意识到一个令他们不敢相信的地步。此书本身是以这样一种方式写的，以致凡有心学习的人都能受益。不止写出的字本身有意义，并且存在于字里行间看不见的联系也有意义，而且对人格的不同层面各有其意义。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:55.) The ideas presented in this book should allow many readers to expand their perceptions and consciousness in ways they may not have believed possible. The book itself is written in such a way that all those ready to learn will benefit. There is meaning not only in the written words themselves, but connections existing between them that do not appear, and that will have meanings to various levels of the personality.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(珍，在出神状态里，几次试想点燃一盒火柴，但它显然是太潮湿了。她最后不得不放下她的新香烟。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Jane, in trance, tried to light a book match several times, but it was evidently too damp. She finally had to put her new cigarette aside.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">任何直觉性资讯的诚正端赖收受者的内在诚正。因此意识的扩展要求诚实的自我评价，对自己的信念及偏见的自觉。(在11:01停顿良久。)它带来一件礼物及一项责任。因此每个希望反观自心，希望找到他们自己的答案，希望赴他们自己“与宇宙的约会”的人，就应当对他们自己人格最隐密的作用方式变得非常熟悉。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The integrity of any intuitive information depends upon the inner integrity of the person who receives it. Expansion of consciousness, therefore, requires honest self appraisal, an awareness of one’s own beliefs and prejudices. (Long pause at 11:01.) It brings a gift and a responsibility. All who wish to look within themselves, to find their own answers, to encounter their own “appointment with the universe,” should therefore become well acquainted with the intimate workings of their own personality.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">结束了(作为赛斯，珍向前倾，她的双眼睁得更大而相当的黑。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>That is it. (As Seth, Jane leaned forward, her eyes open wider and quite dark.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好的。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Okay.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那么，属于我们的附录。你可以问问题、休息或结束此节，随你的便。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>And it is for our Appendix. You may ask questions, take a break, or end the session as you prefer.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“那我们就休息一会儿。”11:02—11:09。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“We’ll take the break, then.” 11:02 to 11:09.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这种自我认识本身就非常有益，在一方面来说也即为自己的酬报。不过，如果你不愿改变你的态度、信念或行为，或检查那些你认为是你独特的个性的话，你就不可能清楚地向内看。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Such self knowledge is in itself highly advantageous, and in one way is its own reward. It is impossible, however, to look inward with any clearness if you are unwilling to change your attitudes, beliefs, or behavior, or examine those characteristics that you consider uniquely your own.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">换言之，没有检查你自己，你就无法检查实相。你不能离开你自己而与“一切万有”接触，你不能将你自己与你的经验分离。(停顿。)你不能利用“真理”，它不能被操纵。不论是谁，凡是以为他在操纵真理的人其实是在操纵他自己。你就是真理。那么就发现你自己吧！</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You cannot examine reality without examining yourself, in other words. You cannot hold encounters with All That Is apart from yourself, and you cannot separate yourself from your experience. (Pause.) You cannot use “truth.” It cannot be manipulated. Whoever thinks he is manipulating truth is manipulating himself. You are truth. Then discover yourself.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">而现在，我要说晚安了(做为赛斯，珍拍拍她的膝盖，笑着。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>And now, I will say good evening. (As Seth, Jane slapped her knee, grinning.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好的，赛斯。非常感谢你。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Okay, Seth. Thank you very much.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">当环境许可时，我们仍将有我们自己的课。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>We will still have our own sessions when circumstances allow.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“没问题。我猜是在这书完成之后。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“All right. Good. When this book is finished, I guess.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">最衷心的祝福。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>My heartiest regards.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“也祝福你。谢谢，晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“The same to you. Thanks. Good night.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:16。当珍终于由另一个很深的出神状态出来时，她说：“啊，我觉得真快乐，但我想我差不多只够气力爬上床了。”她又在打呵欠，而且非常的放松。可爱的小雨还在继续下着。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(11:16 P.M. “Gee, I really feel good,” Jane said, when she finally came out of another deep trance, “but I think I can just about make it to bed.” She was yawning again, and very relaxed. The soft pleasant rain continued.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">ESP班的课</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>ESP CLASS SESSION:</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">1970年6月23日 星期二</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>TUESDAY, JUNE 23, 1970</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(当录下此节时，有十六名珍的ESP班的学员在场。在这课里——此处稍微节略了——众多问题之中，赛斯讨论了我们现在实相里的组织。见第九章第537节有关死后组织的资料。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Some sixteen members of Jane’s ESP class were present when this session was taped. In the session, here slightly abbreviated, Seth discusses organization in our present reality, among others. See the 537th session in Chapter Nine for material on after-death organization.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在任何时候，如果你想要组织那就会有组织。你构造你自己的存在，而且任一特定时间，你都会选择具有完全如你所需的那么多组织的那些实相。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: If you want organization then you shall have it ---- at any time. You structure your own existence, and you choose those realities that have exactly as much organization as you need at any given time.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在这个实相里，你非常“凑巧地”强调那将你们连结在一起的所有相似处；你把它们造成一个模式，而非常“凑巧地”忽略了所有的相异处。从一个广大的感知领域里，你选择把你的注意力贯注于某些特定的区域，而忽略所有其他的。因此就这小小的区域来说，你们间有完全的协议。你无法感知的广大区域则完全不困扰你，而你也不问关于它的问题。但它却是存在的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In this reality, you very nicely emphasize all the similarities which bind you together; you make a pattern of them, and you very nicely ignore all the dissimilarities. Out of a vast field of perception, you choose to focus your attention upon certain specific areas and to ignore all others, and so there is perfect agreement among you as far as this small area is concerned. The vastness that you do not perceive does not bother you at all, and you do not ask questions about it. And yet it exists.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我以前曾说过：如果你能集中注意力于这些相异处，只是注意那些你能感知却没感知的相异处，那么你会惊讶人类竟然能形成任何关于“一个有组织的实相”这种概念。(做为赛斯，珍看看玛丽和阿尔特坐着的沙发。)我现在看着你们两人之间的地方。当其他人看着这儿坐在讲究蓝沙发上的我们的朋友时，他们看到一个道地有组织的画面。这儿有一个人(手指出去)，那儿有一个人，中间留有空间。这画面是蛮平衡的。它显得完美而有组织。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I have said this before: If you were able to focus your attention upon the dissimilarities, merely those that you can perceive but do not, then you would be amazed that mankind can form any idea of an organized reality. (As Seth, Jane looked at the couch, where Mary and Art were sitting.) I look now between the two of you. When the others look at our friends here on the fancy blue couch, they see a picture of true organization. There is an individual there (pointing), and an individual there, with space between. The picture is equalized. It appears perfect and organized.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">可是，在我们的两位朋友之间的空间却不是“空”的。你们认为它是“空”的，因为你们看不到那儿有什么东西。画面看来非常有组织。可是，只要你一旦了悟这画面是不完整的，那你们必然会开始问新的问题，而关于“完美组织”的老概念就消失了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>However, the space between our two friends is not vacant. You think of it as vacant because you do not perceive what is there. The picture appears to be very organized. As soon as you realize that the picture is not complete, however, then you must begin to ask new questions, and the old idea of the perfect organization is gone.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如你所知，你们并不感知在这房里到处游走的原子和分子，也看不到充满了我们两位朋友之间的空间的原子和分子，也不知那些力量——力场——的存在。既然他们坐在沙发上，那沙发的作用就是联合他们。他们到底坐在什么之上？即你们感知为实体的“虚空”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: As you know, you do not perceive the atoms and molecules that swim about the room, nor those that fill the space between our two friends, nor the forces ---- the field forces ---- that exist. The couch serves to unite them since they sit upon it. And what do they sit upon? Emptiness that you perceive as solidity.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">其实，若没有你们特有的肉体感官，你们不会感知沙发为实体。与你们有不同感知机制的意识，对我们现在已出了名的蓝沙发并不知觉。你们造成这组织。你们的思想感知一个组织。你们执行这组织，而真的是创造了它。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now without your particular physical senses you would not perceive the couch as solid. Consciousness that has different perceptive mechanisms than your own is unaware of our now famous blue couch. You make the organization. Your thoughts perceive an organization. You enforce the organization, and indeed create it.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(由一位同学来的问题：“我们全都创造相同的组织而看见相同的沙发吗？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Question from a class member: “Do we all create the same organization and see the same couch?”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(对玛丽和阿尔特：)我有把握你们两个人都大致同意你们是坐在一张沙发上。你们并没感知相同的沙发。你们只感知自己的“意念结构”，却看不到别人的“意念结构”。心电感应地，你转换你的意念以与你所知的别人想法合作。你们彼此同意沙发在这儿。一点不假的，确在你们的物质系统内——因我知道这是下一个问题——你们能丈量你们的沙发。我随时准备有人会拿把尺来量它，然后对我说这沙发是这样长：我怎么能说它不是同一张沙发呢？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(To Mary and Art): You each generally agree, I am sure, that you sit upon a couch. You do not perceive the same couch. You only perceive your own idea constructions. You cannot see those of another. Telepathically, you transpose your ideas in line with what you know of the other person’s thinking. You agree that the couch is here. Now it is true that within your physical system ---- for I know this will come next ---- you can measure your couch. I expect at any moment that someone will get a ruler and measure it, and then say to me that the couch is so long: How can I say it is not one couch?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">可是，在你们的物质系统内，仪器本身就是扭曲的，自然它们会同意所量的东西。没有理由不如此。心电感应地你们全同意物体所放的地点，以及它们的尺寸。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>However, within your physical system the instruments themselves are distorted, and of course they will agree with what they measure. There is no reason why they should not. Telepathically you all agree on the placement of objects, and their dimensions.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们以一种奇怪的方式来运用原子和分子，你们把你们的概念移置到它们上面。你们以某种特定方式感知它们。我并没在怪你们，在我的时代，我也曾那样做过，这里面自有很好的理由。但事实是，物体并不是实质的，除非当你相信它是的时候，而“组织”是由你内心移置到外在之上，而非由外在移置到你身上的。你形成了你所知的实相，纵使这桌子支持住你的手臂，而你能靠在它上面写字，我仍要告诉你桌子不是实体的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: You use atoms and molecules in a strange way. You transpose your ideas upon them. You perceive them in a certain fashion. I am not blaming you. I have done it too, in my time, and there is good reason for it. But the fact is that physical matter is not solid except when you believe that it is, and that organization is transposed from within upon the without. It is not transposed from the without upon you. You form the reality that you know, and even though the table holds up your arms and you may lean upon it and write, I still tell you that the table is not solid.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">只要你能在上面写字，这并没什么差别，只要你能坐在你的蓝沙发上，它也没什么差别。但当你离开你的实质系统，而肉体的感知不再是定规的时候，那时你就必须学习新的“基本假设”了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This makes little difference as long as you can write upon it. It makes little difference as long as you can sit upon your blue couch. But when you leave your physical system and when physical perception is no longer the rule, then you must learn new root assumptions.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">“基本假设”即那些在任何实相系统里，你们所同意的定律(laws)。举例来说，你们“同意”什么物体是实质的——它们到底是或不是并没什么区别，只要你们对这点同意。你们的意识应该在一个身体内，你们死也不愿被发现你的意识在你的身体外面。那是个禁忌！其实，事实是你的意识并没被囚禁在你的身体之内；但只要你相信它是的，再次的，你就死也不肯被人发现你的意识在身体外面。而当你真发现它在外面时，的确将会有些惊愕。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Root assumptions are those laws upon which you agree in any system of reality. You agree, for example, upon what objects are physical ---- it makes little difference whether they are or not, as long as you agree upon this. Your consciousness belongs in a body. You would not be caught DEAD with your consciousness outside of your body. It is taboo! Now the fact is that your consciousness is not imprisoned within your body; but as long as you believe that it is, again, you will not be caught dead outside of it. And when you are caught dead outside of it, there will be some amazement, indeed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">还有其他你当作是实相的基础基本假设。在实相的其他层面，也有其他的基本假设。这些都是你用以辖治你经验的仿佛成立的定律。想到纸不是实体，而笔也不是的话，那我们的记录者还做得真不错呢！你们能用“虚空”做出来的东西实在可惊！</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There are other root assumptions that you take as a basis of reality. And in other levels of reality, there are other root assumptions. These are the seeming laws by which you govern your experiences. Our note takers are doing very well, considering that the paper is not solid and neither are their pens. It is amazing what you can do with nothing!</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(休息和讨论。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Break, and discussion.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们真的是多次元的人格，如我以前说过的。发展到某一点的时候，越来越觉察你们本来面目的真实本质。举例来说，你的一部分对你们刚才讨论的“脉动”就非常地觉察，它也觉察到“记忆”的脉动性质。当这脉动是在这物质实相之内时，那时你们，如你们所知的自己，有对“这个存在”的记忆。当这脉动是在另一次元中的时候，就有对“那个存在”的记忆。其实你们整个本体有某个部分有这两者的记忆。整个人格结构居住在许多次元里，并且是同时的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You are truly multidimensional personalities, as I have said before. At some point in your development you will become more and more aware of the true nature of your identity. There is, for example, a part of you who is very aware of the pulsations you have just been discussing, and who is aware of the pulse-like nature of memory. When the pulse is in this physical reality, then you, as you know yourselves, have memory of this existence. When the pulse is in another dimension, there is memory of that existence. Now a portion of your entire identity has memory of both. The entire personality structure dwells in many dimensions, and simultaneously.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们对任何心理学概念还处在最开端的地位。你们对你们现在是什么根本就不了解；而就如我以前说过的，当你问我有关死后生活的问题时，你自动地转移——如果你肯原谅我这么说——这“无知”到下一个领域里。因此，有时我不知如何回答你们的问题。你们正在学习认识你们自己，以你们现在进行的速度，那还得花你们相当的时间！</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You are at the very beginning of any idea of psychology. You simply do not realize what you are now; and as I’ve said before, when you ask me questions about life after death, you automatically transpose ---- ? if you will forgive me ---- this lack of knowledge into the next realm. Therefore, sometimes I am at a loss to answer your questions. You are learning to know yourselves. At the rate you are going, it will take you some time!</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">好：当你正确地了解如何用“心理时间”的时候，那么你就多少能学着改变意识的本质与焦点。你能把它转向许多方向，你也能把它自物质实相转开而贯注在其他方面。这并不指你的肉身会孤独无助地被留在此。它的真意是指你将开始探索自己的实相，以及你在其中存在的那些其他实相。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: When you properly understand how to use psychological time, then to some extent you can learn to alter the nature and focus of your consciousness. You can turn it in many directions. You can focus it in other ways, away from physical reality. This does not mean that you will be left high and dry here. It does mean that you will begin to explore the reality of yourselves, and of those other dimensions in which you have your existence.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，你必须甘愿承认有其他的次元而你存在于其中。你也必须对你的血肉之躯有信心——相信当你回来时它会在这儿，我向你保证它会的。别无他法——我再重复一遍——别无他法可以获得关于其他实相的亲身资讯，除了经由对你自己意识的探索与操纵之外。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There must be, however, a willingness to admit that there are other dimensions in which you exist. You must also have faithin your physical self ---- faiththat it will be here when you get back, and I assure you that it will. There is no other way ---- and I repeat this ---- there is no other way of getting firsthand information about other realities except by the exploration and manipulation of your own consciousness.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">当我跟你们说话时，我极少用像“爱”这种字眼。我没告诉你有一位“神”在一扇黄金之门的另一边等着你。我也不会为了使你安心而告诉你：当你死了，“神”会以所有祂的无上慈悲等着你，而你的责任就到此为止。因而就如我昨晚在最后一章里所说的，我对懒情者没有提供希望，因他们不会找到永远的安息。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now when I speak to you I very seldom use such words as “love.” I do not tell you that a God is waiting for you on the other side of a golden door. I do not reassure you by telling you that when you are dead, God will be waiting for you in all his majestic mercy, and that that will be the end of your responsibility. And so as I said last evening, in my latest chapter, I offer no hope for the lazy, for they will not find eternal rest.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">可是，经由在你们自己内心的游历，你将会发现自己意识与其他意识的统一性。你将发现把“意识”赐给所有东西的那“多次元的爱与能量”。这不会令你想要躺在那众所周知的慈怀里安息，反而会激励你在“创造”这件工作上做得很好；而你的确会发现并感受到那种“上帝临在”的感觉，因为你将在分子之舞的背后，也在你自己之内与你的邻居之内感觉到它。这么多人所想要的是一位走过大街、对大家说：“主日快乐。我就是我，追随我吧！”的“神”。但“神”是巧妙地隐藏在神的创造物之内的，因此祂即一切，而一切即祂；在认识万物的时候你就认识了祂。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>However, through traveling within yourselves, you will discover the unity of your consciousness with other consciousnesses. You will discover the multidimensional love and energy that gives consciousness to all things. This will not lead you to want to rest upon the proverbial blessed bosom. It will instead inspire you to take a better hand in the job of creation; and that feeling of divine presence you will find indeed, and feel indeed, for you will sense it behind the dance of the molecules, and in yourselves and in your neighbors. What so many want is a God who walks down the street and says, “Happy Sunday, I am I, follow me.” But God is hidden craftily in his creations, so that he is what they are and they are what he is; and in knowing them, you know him.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(休息与讨论。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Break, and discussion.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们对“心理时间”讨论了很多。我并不光是指我教的冥想方法。我的确是指你们主动去做的主观活动与探索。你们懂吗？我很高兴！</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: There are many words for psychological time. I do not mean my method of meditation alone. I do mean subjective activity on your part, and exploration. Do you follow me? I am glad!</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">实际上，你现在就与“神”同在。没领悟到这点的，正是你自己。你明白吗？你曾相信过许多故事，象征性地说，它们是非常重要的。如我先前说过的，它们在你们的生活与你们的发展中有其地位，但有些时候你们必须把它们放下，而没有它们，有一阵子你们也许会感到孤独。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Actually, you are with God now. It is you who do not realize this. You see, you have believed many tales, and symbolically they were very important. As was mentioned earlier, they have their place in your lives and your development, but there are times when you must leave them behind, and you may feel lonesome for a while without them.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(问题：那么我们是需要那些信念作为我们发展的一部分啰？纵使我们后来把它们舍弃？)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Question: “Then we need those beliefs as part of our development, even though we cast them off later?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">是的，纵使有些像我自己这样的人将会到来而拿走了慰藉人的毛毯——因为虽然早先它们帮助你成长，过了一会儿它们却会阻碍你的发展。不过，事实仍然是：要找到“神”，你并不是非死不可，“一切万有”就是当下，而现在你就是“一切万有”的一部分。如我常告诉你们的，你们现在就是一个“灵”。现在，发展的大道就是开放的。如果你想的话，现在你就能出发并探索非物质的环境，但我看不到任何学生冲进那隐形的门口！</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Yes, even though someone like myself will come along and take off the comfort blankets ---- for after a while they hamper your development, where earlier they helped you grow. The fact remains, however: You do not have to die to find God. All That Is, is now, and you are a part of All That Is now. As I have told you often, you are a spirit now. The avenues for development are open now. You can, now, set out to explore environments that are not physical if you want to, but I do not see any rush of students at that invisible door!</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在我将结束我们的课。但我希望你们都仔细地读我所说过的话的副本。偶尔，当你没有其他事可做时——没有更好的事可做时——那就试试，试着感觉你意识脉动里的空档，试着跳过那空隙！</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now I am going to close our session, but I would like you all to read carefully a copy of what I have said. And now and then, when you have nothing else to do ---- nothing better to do ---- then try, try to sense that lapse in the pulsation of your consciousness. Try to leap that gap!</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我向你们全体道晚安。(11:25)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I bid you all good evening. (11:25 P.M.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">ESP班的课</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>ESP CLASS SESSION:</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">1970年6月23日之前</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>BEFORE JUNE 23, 1970</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(这是珍的一个学生所保留的，是几节不是遗失了就是没完全录下来的ESP课之中，所剩的残章断简，见第九章。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(This remnant, saved by one of Jane’s students, is all that is left from one of the few class sessions that were either lost or not fully recorded. See Chapter Nine.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">真正的灵性(spirituality)是一件喜乐而且入世的事，与大人的假正经不相干，与冗长的话和充满悲愁的面孔也不相干。它却的确与你内在的意识之舞有关，以及在你心里的心灵探险感觉有关。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>True spirituality is a thing of joy and of the earth, and has nothing to do with fake adult dignity. It has nothing to do with long words and sorrowful faces. It has to do with the dance of consciousness that is within you, and with the sense of spiritual adventure that is within your hearts.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那就是灵性的意义；而如我以前告诉过你的，如果我能的话，我愿在屋里跳一个快活的舞，好让你明白你的活力并不倚赖一个肉身形象。它既不倚赖你的青春，也不倚赖你的身体。你的活力摇铃且歌唱，响彻这宇宙，响彻你整个人格。使得所有的创造成为可能的是一种喜乐感。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>That is the meaning of spirituality; and as I have told you before, if I could I would do a merry dance about the room to show you that your vitality is not dependent upon a physical image. It is not dependent upon your youth, it is not dependent upon your body. It rings and sings through the universe, and through your entire personality. It is a sense of joy that makes all creativity probable.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此当你拉长了脸时不要以为你是富有灵性，当你为你的罪而贬低自己时不要以为你是灵性。在你们系统内的季节来而复往，不论你以为你是罪人或圣人，太阳仍照在你脸上。宇宙的活力就是创造性、喜乐和爱，而那即灵性，那就是我要告诉我的书的读者们的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>So do not think you are being spiritual when you are being long-faced, and do not think you are being spiritual when you berate yourself for your sins. The seasons within your system come and go. The sun falls upon your face whether you think you are a sinner or a saint. The vitality of the universe is creativity and joy and love, and that is spirituality. And that is what I shall tell the readers of my book.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在，如我答应过你们的，休息一会儿……。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>And now, take the break I promised you….</details><br>
