<a id=1 href=1>第568节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>FEBRUARY 22, 1971, 9:19 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年2月22日 星期一 晚上9：19</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane felt very relaxed and sleepy by session time, yet she didn’t want to miss a session. She began speaking at a slower pace than usual.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(到了要上课时珍觉得很轻松而瞌睡，但她却不想错过一课。她开始以较平常慢的速度说话。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>好，口述。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The chapter heading: “PROBABILITIES, the Nature of Good and Evil, and Religious Symbolism.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>本章题目〈可能性、善恶的本质和宗教使用的象征〉。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Christian dogma speaks of the ascension of Christ, implying of course a vertical ascent into the heavens, and the development of the soul is often discussed in terms of direction. To progress is supposedly to ascend, while the horror of religious punishment, hell, is seen at the bottom of all things.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>基督教教义说到“基督升天”(Ascension of Christ)，自然是暗示向上直升到天堂，而灵魂的发展也常是以方向的说法来讨论的。进步假定就是上升，同时宗教性惩罚的恐怖——地狱——是被看成在所有东西之“下”的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Development is therefore considered in a one-line direction only, in Christian terms. Seldom, for example, is it thought of in horizontal terms. The idea of evolution in its popular meaning promulgated this theory, as through gradual progression in a one-line direction, man emerged from the ape. (Humorously): Christ could just as well have disappeared sideways.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，以基督教的说法，发展是被看作只在一个单线方向的。举例来说，它很少被想成水平方向的。通俗的进化观念把这理论传开，说人是由猿猴循单线方向逐渐进化而来。(幽默地：)基督其实也可以沿水平方向消失呀！</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:26.) The inner reality of the message was told in terms that man at the time could understand, in line with his root assumptions. Development unfolds in all directions. The soul is not ascending a series of stairs, each one representing a new and higher point of development.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:26停顿。)“发展”这信息的内在意义是以当时人能了解的方式说出的，与他的基本假定一致。“发展”向所有的方向展开。灵魂并不是沿一连串的梯子向上爬，每一道梯子代表发展的新而更高的一点。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Instead, the soul stands at the center of itself, exploring, extending its capacities in all directions at once, involved in issues of creativity, each one highly legitimate. The probable system of reality opens up the nature of the soul to you. It should change current religion’s ideas considerably. For this reason, the nature of good and evil is a highly important point.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>相反的，灵魂是站在它自己的中心，在同一瞬间向所有的方向探索，扩展它的能力，涉入创造性的论题里，每一个都是极合法的。可能的实相系统对你开示了灵魂的本质。它应当会相当地改变你们流行的宗教观念。为此之故，善与恶的本质是个非常重要的要点。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30.) On the one hand, quite simply and in a way that you cannot presently understand, evil does not exist. However, you are obviously confronted with what seem to be quite evil effects. Now it has been said often that there is a god, so there must be a devil ---- or if there is good, there must be evil. This is like saying that because an apple has a top, it must have a bottom ---- but without any understanding of the fact that both are a portion of the apple. (Pause; one of many.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30)在另一方面，十分简单地，以一种你目前不能了解的方式，恶是不存在的。可是，你显然面对着看似十分邪恶的事。人们且常说，既然有一个神，因此必然有一个魔——或说如果有善，则必有恶。这就像是说因为一个苹果有上一半，它就一定有下一半一样——却对两者皆为苹果之一部分这个事实毫不了解。(停顿：许多停顿之一。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We go back to our fundamentals: You create reality through your feelings, thoughts, and mental actions. Some of these are physically materialized, others are actualized in probable systems. You are presented with an endless series of choices, it seems, at any point, some more or less favorable than others.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们回到我们的基本理论：你经由你的情感、思想与精神活动而创造实相。这些中有些被具体地物质化了，其他的则在可能的系统里实现了。似乎，在任一点，你都有一个无穷的选择系统，有些选择比另一些看来更好或更差。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You must understand that eachmental act is a reality for which you are responsible. That is what you are in this particular system of reality for. As long as you believe in a devil, for example, you will create one that is real enough for you, and for the others who continue to create him.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你必须了解，每一个精神性行动都是你要负责的一个实相。那就是你在这个特定的实相系统里的目的。举例来说，只要你相信有魔鬼，你就真的为自己创造了一个魔鬼，并且那些相信他的人们也将继续创造他。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:35.) Because of the energy he is given by others, he will have a certain consciousness of his own, but such a mock devil has no power or reality to those who do not believe in his existence, and who do not give him energy through their belief . He is, in other words, a superlative hallucination As mentioned earlier, those who believe in a hell and assign themselves to it through their belief can indeed experience one, but certainly in nothing like eternal terms. No soul is forever ignorant.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:35)因为别人赋予他的能量，魔鬼会有他自己的某种意识，但这样一个假想的魔鬼，对那些不相信他的存在的人和不因其信念而给他能量的人，没有力量或实相。换言之，他是个最高级的幻相。如前面说过，那些相信有地狱并透过他们的信念而把自己指派到地狱的人，的确会经历它。但肯定不会以任何永久性的方式，因为没有一个灵魂是永远无知的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now those who have such beliefs actually lack a necessary deep trust in the nature of consciousness, of the soul, and of All That Is. They concentrate upon not what they think of as the power of good, but fearfully upon what they think of as the power of evil.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那些有这种信仰的人，事实上对意识的本质、灵魂和“一切万有”缺乏一种必要的深刻信任。他们没有把心念贯注于他们认为是善的力量上，却是害怕地贯注于他们认为是恶的力量上。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:40.) The hallucination is created, therefore, out of fear and of restriction. The devil idea is merely the mass projection of certain fears ---- mass in that it is produced by many people, but also limited in that there have always been those who rejected this principle.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:40)因此，这幻相是由恐惧与限制创造出来的。魔鬼这概念只是某种恐惧的集体投射——集体是因为它由许多人所投射，却又是有限，因为总有些人不信邪。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Some very old religions understood the hallucinatory nature of the devil concept, but even in Egyptian times, the simpler and more distorted ideas became prevalent, particularly with the masses of people. In some ways, men in those times could not understand the concept of a god without the concept of a devil.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>有些非常古老的宗教了解“魔鬼观念”的幻相性质，但甚至在古埃及时代，这种较简单而更扭曲的概念变得流行起来，特别是流行于群众之间。在某些方面来说，那时候的人没有魔鬼的观念就无法了解神的观念。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Storms, for example, are highly creative natural events, though they can also cause destruction. Early man could see only the destruction. Some intuitively understood that any effects are creative, despite their appearances, but few could convince their fellow men.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如，暴风雨是非常具创造性的自然事件，虽然它们也能造成破坏。早期的人只能看到那破坏。有些人却直觉地了解到任何效果都是创造性的，不管它们表面看来如何，但很少人能说服他的同胞。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:47.) The light-and-darkness contrast presents us with the same kind of picture. The good was seen as light, for men felt safer in the day. The evil was therefore assigned to nightfall. Within the mass of distortions, however, hidden beneath the dogma there was always a hint of the basic creativity of every effect.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:47停顿。)光与暗的对比带给我们同一类的画面。善被看作是光，因为人在白天感觉比较安全。因而邪恶便被派给了夜晚。可是，在大量的扭曲之内，隐藏在教条之下永远有对于“每个效果在基本上都是一种创造”的暗示。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There are, then, no devils waiting to carry anyone off, unless you create them yourself, in which case the power resides in you and not in the mock devils. The Crucifixion and attendant drama made sense within your reality at the time. It arose into the world of physical actuality out of the inner reality from which your deepest intuitions and insights also spring.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，并没有魔鬼在等着把任何人夺走，除非你们自己创造了它们，若是如此，则力量存于你们内在而不在假想的魔鬼内。“订十字架”与附带的戏码在当时你们的实相内是有意义的。它由内在实相升起进入具体确实的世界，你们最深的直觉与洞见也源自这内在实相。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:52.) The race brought forth the events, then, that would best convey in physical terms this deeper nonphysical knowledge of the indestructibility of the soul. This particular drama would not have made sense to other systems with different root assumptions than your own.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:52)那么，人类把这些事件带出来，因为它最能将“灵魂不可灭”这个更深的无形知识传达到物质世界。对其他具有不同基本假设的系统，这出特定的戏剧是没有意义的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:54. Jane’s trance had been good. Her delivery had picked up considerably. And of course I’ve often seen her respond to this infusion of energy and liveliness, seemingly from a source beyond Jane as I know her. If anything, her transformation is more pronounced when she’s not at her best before a session begins…. Resume at 10:07.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:54。珍的出神状态很好。她的传述也加快了不少，自然我也常常见到她对这种能量与活力的输入反应，这能量与活力看来是由珍之外的来源注入的。不说别的，当她在上课前精神若不是最好，她的改变就越发明显。……在10:07继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: The symbolism of ascent or descent, or of light and dark, would be meaningless to other realities with different perceptive mechanisms. While your religions are built around an enduring kernel of truth, the symbolism used was craftily selected by the inner self in line with its knowledge of those root assumptions you hold as valid in the physical universe. Other information, in dreams for example, will also be given to you with the same symbolism, generally speaking. The symbolism itself, however, was simply used by the inner self. It does not inherently belong to inner reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>上升或下降、光或暗的象征，对那些具有不同感知机构的其他实相系统来说，将是无意义的。虽然你们的宗教是围绕着一个颠扑不破的“真理种子”建造出来的，它所用的象征却是由“内我”很技巧地选择出来，以配合这物质宇宙里那些你们认为合理的基本假设。其他的资讯，例如在梦中的，一般来说也会以相同的象征给你们。不过，这象征本身只是为“内我”所用，它并非天生就属于内在实相的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:13.) Many probable systems have perceptive mechanisms far different from your own. In fact, some are based upon gestalts of awareness completely alien to you. Quite without realizing it, your ego is a result of group consciousness, for example; the one consciousness that most directly faces the exterior world, is dependent upon the minute consciousness that resides within each living cell of your body; and as a rule you are only aware of one ego ---- at least at a time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:13)许多可能系统的感知机制和你们的大不相同。事实上，有些是建立在你们完全陌生的知觉完形。举例来说，你并没有了解到你的“自我”是集体意识的结果；那个最直接面对外在世界的意识，是依赖着居住于你身体的每一个活细胞内的微细意识；而一般言之，你只觉知一个自我——至少在某一时刻。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In some systems the “individual” is quite aware of having more egos than one, in your terms. The entire psychological organization is in a way richer than your own. A Christ who was not aware of this would not appear in such a system, you see. There are kinds of perception with which you are not familiar, worlds in which your idea of light does not exist, where almost infinite gradations of thermal qualities are absorbed in terms of sensation, not of light.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在有些系统里，以你们的话来说，一个“个人”颇为觉知他有不止一个“自我”。他整个的心理组织就某种意识来说，比你们自己的要丰富得多。你要知道，一个不明白这一点的“基督”，不会出现在这样一个系统里。的确有你们不熟悉的知觉，的确有些世界，你们对光的概念在那里并不存在，在那儿，就知觉而言，“人们”感到几乎无限层次的“热”而非“光”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:21.) In any of these worlds, the Christ drama could never appear as it appeared within your own. Now the same thing applies to each of your great religions, though as I have said in the past, the Buddhists come closer, generally speaking, to a description of the nature of reality. They have not understood the eternal validity of the soul, however, in terms of its exquisite invulnerability, nor been able to hold a feeling for its unique character. But Buddha, like Christ, interpreted what he almost knew in terms of your own reality. Not only of your own physical reality, but your own probable physical reality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:21)在任何这样的世界里，“基督”这场戏绝不能像它在你们自己的世界里那样演出。那么同样的，你们每一个伟大的宗教也莫不如此，都是因应你们而生的。虽然如我过去所说，一般说来，佛教的描述比较接近实相的本质。可是他们没了解灵魂的永远效力，就它绝妙的不可侵犯性质来说，他们也不能把握对灵魂独特性的感受。但佛陀，像基督一样，诠释了他对你们自己的实相几乎知道的一切。还不仅是对你们自己的物质实相，也是对你们自己可能的物质实相加以诠释。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:28.) The methods, the secret methods behind all of the religions, were meant to lead man into a realm of understanding that existed apart from the symbols and the stories, into inner realizations that would take him both within and without the physical world that he knew. There are many manuscripts still not discovered, from old monasteries particularly in Spain, that tell of underground groups within religious orders who kept these secrets alive when other monks were copying old Latin manuscripts.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:28)那些法门，在所有宗教背后的秘密法门，其意义就在引导人进入一个存在于象征和故事之外的了解境界，带他到他所知的物质世界之内与之外的内在觉悟。在古老的修道院里，特别是在西班牙，尚有许多未发现的文稿，说到在天主教的修会里有地下团体，当其他的僧侣在抄写古老的拉丁文稿时，他们则负责让这些密法继续下去。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There were tribes who never learned to write in Africa and Australia who also knew these secrets, and men called “Speakers” who memorized them and spread them upward, even throughout northern portions of Europe, before the time of Christ.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>从前在非洲和澳洲有些部落，他们从没学会写字，他们也知道这些密法，有叫作“说法者”(Speakers)的人，记住这些密法而向北传播它们，在基督的时代之前，甚至遍及欧洲北部。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Could you give a copy of one of those Speaker manuscripts in dictation?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“你能否口述一篇那些‘说法者’的文稿？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It is possible, and would take much time and excellent circumstances.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那是可能的，但要花很多时间并且要有最佳的环境。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Well, naturally I’d like to see it sometime.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好吧，我自然希望有一天能看到它。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Offhand, the work involved could take five years, for there were several versions, and a group of leaders, each going in different directions, who taught their people. The world was far more ripe for Christianity than people suppose, because of these groups. The ideas were “buried” already throughout Europe.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>随口说一句，有关的工作可能要花上五年，因为有好几种说法，领袖也不只一位，每个教给他们的人民不同的方向。因为这些团体之故，世界对接受基督教义而言，比人们所假设的准备程度要成熟得多了。那些概念已经“埋藏”遍及欧陆了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 10:36. “Buried” is the word Seth wanted here; I questioned him to make sure.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在10:36停顿。“埋藏”是赛斯在这儿要的字，我问过他以确定没错。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(A note: Seth has mentioned the Speakers just once before. This happened quite unexpectedly in the 558th Session for November 5, 1970. The apropos portion of that session, which was held for friends in an effort to resolve certain problems, is given in the Appendix, with notes. Jane and I find the idea of the Speakers most interesting. We’d like to learn more about this, and may make it a future project.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(注：赛斯以前只提到“说法者”一次。这是在1970年11月五日的第558节十分出乎意料地发生的。那一节是为几个朋友解决某些问题而举行的，其有关的部分放在附录中。珍和我觉得“说法者”的概念非常有趣。我们想多知道一些，可能把它当作一个将来的计划。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Many important concepts were lost, however. The emphasis was on practical methods of living ---- quite simply ---- rules that could be understood, but the reasons for them were forgotten.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>不过，许多重要的观念已失传了。强调的是实用性的生活方法——很简单地——能被了解的法则，但它们的理由被遗忘了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The Druids obtained some of their concepts from Speakers. So did the Egyptians. The Speakers predated the emergence of any religions that you know, and the religions of the Speakers arose spontaneously in many scattered areas, then grew like wildfire from the heart of Africa and Australia. There was one separate group in an area where the Aztecs dwelled at a later date, though the land mass was somewhat different then, and some of the lower cave dwellings at times were under water.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>德鲁伊(Druid，译注：在古代凯尔特社会中，德鲁伊教的地位崇高，不但，掌管祭祀，也是预言家、历史记录者、诗人、法官、魔法家等)由“说法者”那儿获得一些观念。古埃及人也是。“说法者”比你所知的任何宗教都要早，“说法者”的宗教在许多分散的地区同时升起，然后由非洲和澳洲的心脏地带像野火般传过来。在后来阿兹特克人(Aztecs，译注：墨西哥中部的土著，1519年为西班牙人征服)居住的那个地带，当时有一个分开的团体，虽然在那时的大地陆块与现在有些不同，有些较低的穴居处当时偶尔会沉在水面下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:41.) Various bands of the Speakers continued through the centuries. Because they were trained so well, the messages retained their authenticity. They believed, however, that it was wrong to set words into written form, and so did not record them. They also used natural earth symbols, but clearly understood the reasons for this. The Speakers, singly, existed in your Stone Age period, and were leaders. Their abilities helped the cavemen survive. There was little physical communication, however, in those days between the various Speakers, and some were unaware of the existence of the others.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:41)各种不同的“说法者”群世代相传。因为他们被训练得这么好，使得信息保持了它们的真实性。可是，他们相信把说的话置于文字的形式中是不对的，因此没有把它们记录下来。他们也用到自然的土地象征，但很清楚了解如此做的理由。“说法者”曾个别地存在于你们的石器时代里，而且是领袖。他们的才能帮助穴居人得以幸存。可是，在那些时候在各个“说法者”之间很少有实际的通讯，有些并不知其他“说法者”的存在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Their message was as “pure” and undistorted as possible. It was for this reason however, through the centuries, that many who heard it translated it into parables and tales. Now, strong portions of Jewish scriptures carry traces of the message of these early Speakers, but even here, distortions have hidden the messages.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他们的信息尽可能地“纯粹”而不扭曲。但就因这缘故，世代以来，许多听到信息的人就把它转译成了寓言和故事。现在，大部分犹太经文仍带有这些早期“说法者”信息的少许痕迹，但即使在此，扭曲也已隐蔽了信息。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:44. Jane said that after my questions she felt herself “go back and back and back,” as she talked about the Speakers.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:44。珍说在我发问之后，当她谈到“说法者”的时候，她觉得自己“向回再向回再向回走”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(It is of interest here to note that a current Biblical reference work, in dealing with the very early history of Israel, has much to say about the “oral traditions” which preceded ---- and thus helped shape ---- the written word by many centuries. During this long oral period many distortions, omissions, etc., took place for a variety of reasons. Recent work has shown that the early gathering and writing of traditions dates from about the twelfth century B.C. This in turn led to the biblical books. Resume at 11:02.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(此地要提一件有意思的事：目前有一件圣经参考资料在谈到以色列极早期的历史时，对“口述的传统”(oral traditions)说了许多。“口传”比文字记载要早了好几世纪，也有助其形成。在这漫长的口传时期，为了各种理由而有许多的扭曲、佚失发生。近来的研究显示早期对“传统”的收集和记录要回溯到差不多公元前12世纪。这些随之导向圣经书籍的写作。在11:02继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Since consciousness forms matter, and not the other way around, then thought exists before the brain and after it. A child can think coherently before he learns vocabulary ---- but he cannot impress the physical universe in its terms. So this inner knowledge has always been available, but is to become physically manifest ---- literally made flesh. The Speakers were the first to impress this inner knowledge upon the physical system, to make it physically known. Sometimes only one or two Speakers were alive in several centuries. Sometimes there were many. They looked around them and knew that the world sprang from their interior reality. They told others. They knew (pause) that the seemingly solid natural objects about them were composed of many minute consciousnesses.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>既然意识形成物质，而非其反面，那么思想存在于脑子之前，而当脑子灭后，思想仍然存在。一个小孩在他学会生字之前已能连贯地思想——但他不能以无形的思想在物质宇宙里留下他的记号。因此这内在知识是一直在那儿的，只是等着变成具体的示现——真正被赋予血肉。“说法者”是最先把这内在知识铭记在物质宇宙上的，使它在人间有形的显现出来。有时在几世纪里只有一、两个“说法者”活着，有时候则有很多。他们环顾四周就知道，世界是从他们的内在实相跃出的。他们把这告诉别人。他们知道(停顿)，那在他们身边看起来好像很坚实的自然物体是由许多微小的意识组成的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>They realized that from their own creativity they formed idea into matter, and that the stuff of matter was itself conscious and alive. They were intimately familiar with the natural rapport existing between themselves and their environment, therefore, and knew that they could alter their environment through their own acts.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他们了悟到，由他们自己的创造性，他们将概念形成物质，而组成“物”的成分自身是有意识的、活的。因此，对存在于他们自己与环境之间自然的融洽，他们知之甚稔，因而知道他们能由自己的行为改变环境。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now I will end here for the night, and continue with the Speakers at our next session.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那我就在此结束今晚的课，下次再继续讲“说法者”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Was Ruburt, or Jane, ever a Speaker?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“鲁柏或珍曾是个‘说法者’吗？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Ruburt was.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>鲁柏是的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Were you?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“你呢？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I was indeed. There were two others that you know of. The one mentioned in class material (in the 558th session), and the other yourself. (This was a distinct surprise to me.) Now the Speakers themselves in the reincarnational process can also use or not use their abilities in any given life, or be aware of them. I bid you a fond good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我的确是。还有两个你们认识的。其一在ESP班的资料里(第558节中)提到过，另一个就是你自己。(这我确实没想到。)至于在转世过程里的“说法者”，在任一生中，可以用也可以不用他们的能力，或也可以不觉知他的能力。我祝你们晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“The same to you, Seth. Thank you very much.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“你也一样，赛斯，非常感谢你。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause.) You must remember, as a postscript, that there have been millions of Speakers.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(停顿。)你必须记住，当作一项附注，“说法者”有成千上万个。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.” 11:13 P.M. Jane said she remembered Seth saying that both of us had been Speakers. She’d had a quick, almost disbelieving reaction: “Now, that’s just too pat.” Then she had felt Seth return with the mention of the millions as an answer, blunting any particular uniqueness in the fact that both of us had been Speakers and were now producing the Seth material.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好的。”11:13分。珍说她记得赛斯说我俩都曾是“说法者”。她有个快速的、几乎不予置信的反应：“哦，那是太恭维了吧。”然后她感觉到赛斯回来提到成千上万作为回答，这使得我俩都曾是“说法者”，而现在制作“赛斯资料”这回事就不再有任何特别独特之处了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(After the session I wondered if the Seth material itself could be a distorted version of the Speakers’ messages. Jane said it might be possible. Actually, she felt, the Speakers’ material was “probably more poetical.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(课后我在猜想，是否赛斯资料本身即为“说法者”信息的一个扭曲的说法。珍说有此可能。事实上，她感觉，“说法者”的资料“可能更富诗意”。)</a>
