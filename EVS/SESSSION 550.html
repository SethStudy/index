<div style="display:inline">(从9月7日到19日，珍和我作了七个城市的广播、电视宣传旅行，以推广珍的书——《灵界的讯息》。我们发现这个经验很刺激并具教育性；赛斯在波士顿的电视上现身说法，很受欢迎。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(From September 7 until 19 Jane and I were on a radio and television tour of seven cities, to publicize Jane’s book, The Seth Material. We found the experience stimulating and educational; Seth spoke on television in Boston, and was very well received.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(自我们回家后，举行了两次赛斯课——来回答问题及处理因周游而引起的其他事情。现在那些都办好了，珍很渴望赛斯再开始写他的书。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Two sessions have been held since our return home ---- to answer questions and handle other matter raised by the tour. Now with this work taken care of, Jane was eager for Seth to resume work on his book.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(卡尔与苏·华京斯参与了这一课。苏带来一张问题单，我们把它加在我们本有的问题单里。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Carl and Sue Watkins· witnessed the session. Sue brought a list of questions, which we added to others already on hand.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安”。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">也祝旅行的朋友们晚安。我们将开始下一章，叫。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>And good evening to my traveling friends, here. We are going to begin our next chapter, to be called: “reincarnational Relationships.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在你所有转世的存在中，你一直在扩展你的意识、你的意念、你的感知、你的价值观。你挣脱了自设的限制，而在你学会脱离狭窄的观念与教条时，你精神上便有了成长。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Throughout your reincarnational existences you expand your consciousness, your ideas, your perceptions, your values. You break away from self-adopted restrictions, and you grow spiritually as you learn to step aside from limiting conceptions and dogmas.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">可是，你学习的速度完全看你自己：对善恶的狭窄、教条性或死板的观念会妨碍你。如果你不选择在精神与心灵上有弹性的话，关于存在本质过于狭窄的观念可能跟随你几世之久。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your rate of learning depends entirely upon you, however. Limited, dogmatic, or rigid concepts of good and evil can hold you back. Too narrow ideas of the nature of existence can follow you through several lives if you do not choose to be spiritually and psychically flexible.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这些死板的概念的确可以像牵狗的皮带一样，使你被迫像被缚的小狗般绕着很小的圈子打转。在这种情形，也许在一组的人生里，你发现自己一直在与善恶的概念打仗，绕着一个困扰、犹疑和忧虑的圈子打转。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>These rigid ideas can indeed act as leashes, so that you are forced to circle like a tied puppy dog about a very small radius. In such cases, through perhaps a group of existences, you will find yourself battling against ideas of good and evil, running about in a circle of confusion, doubt, and anxiety.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因为“物以类聚”之故，你的朋友和熟人也都会关心同样的问题。因此，我再一次告诉你，你们对善恶的许多概念是极为扭曲的，遮蔽了所有你对实相本质的了解。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your friends and acquaintances will be concerned with the same problems, for you will draw to yourself those with the same concerns. I am telling you again, therefore, that many of your ideas of good and evil are highly distortive, and shadow all understanding you have of the nature of reality.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如果你在心中形成了一个罪恶感，那它对你就是个实相，你必须去解决它。但你们许多人为了不充分的理由形成罪恶感，而你们没道理地为自己套上这罪恶感的鞍。在你们行动的次元里好像有各类荒唐的罪恶。让我告诉你们，恨一种恶的人只会创造出另一种恶来。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>If you form a guilt in your mind, then it is a reality for you, and you must work it out. But many of you form guilts for which there is no adequate cause, and you saddle yourselves with these guilts without reason. In your dimension of activity there appear to be a wild assortment of evils. Let me tell you that he who Hates an evil merely creates another one.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:45)由你们的参考点内，你们常常很难知觉到，所有的事件都是为达到创造性，或信赖你们自己天性中即兴的创造性。在你们的系统内，杀戮显然是个道德上的罪，但是为惩罪而处死另一个人只加重了原先的错误。有个建立了一个教会——如果你要的话，可说一个文明——的有名人物一度曾说：“如果有人打你左脸，就转过右脸让他打。”不过，那句话的本来意义应该被了解。你应该给他另一边脸，因为你领悟到基本上打人的人只是打他自己。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:45.) Now: From within your point of reference it is often difficult for you to perceive that all events work toward creativity, or to trust in the spontaneous creativity of your own natures. Within your system, to kill is obviously a moral crime, but to kill another in punishment only compounds the original error. Someone very well known who established a church ---- if you will, a civilization ---- once said, “Turn the other cheek if you are attacked.” The original meaning of that remark, however, should be understood. You should turn the other cheek because you realize that basically the attacker only attacks himself.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那么你就自由了，而那个反应是个适当的反应。可是如果你没有这个了解而心怀怨恨的给他另一边脸，或如果你出自一种假道学的优越感而给他另一边脸，那反应就一点都不合适了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Then you are free, and the reaction is a good one. If you turn the other cheek without this understanding, however, and feel resentful, or if you turn the other cheek out of a feeling of pseudomoral superiority, then the reaction is far from adequate.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">所有这些都适用于你转世存在中的人际关系上，并且当然也与你目前的日常经验极为相关。如果你恨别人，只要你让那恨在你心中燃烧多少辈子，那恨就可以把你跟他绑在一起多少辈子。在这一生及所有的来生中，你的注意力集中在哪些特质上，就会吸引那些特质到你身上。如果你极关心那些你觉得别人加诸于你的不公平，那你就会吸引更多这种经验，而且如果这继续下去，那么它将会反映在你下一生中。不过在每世之间确实有“时间”来了解与沉思。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now all of this can be applied to your relationships in your reincarnational existences, and of course it also is highly pertinent to your current daily experience. If you Hate another person, that Hate may bind you to him through as many lives as you allow the Hate to consume you. You draw to yourself in this existence and in all others those qualities upon which you concentrate your attention. If you vividly concern yourself with the injustices you feel have been done you, then you attract more such experience, and if this goes on, then it will be mirrored in your next existence. It is true that in between lives there is “time” for understanding and contemplation.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">但是那些在此生不利用这种机会的人，通常在此生结束时也不会这样做。意识会扩展。它会创造。它会尽全力这样做。可是并没有在你自己之外的力量来强迫你了解或面对这些问题。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Those who do not take advantage of such opportunities in this life often do not do so when it is over. Consciousness will expand. It will create. It will turn itself inside out to do so. There is nothing outside of yourself that will force you to understand these issues or face them.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">那么，说“当这一生过去了，我会回顾我的经验，而修正我的道路”是没用的。这就像一个年轻人说：“当我老了，退休了，我会去用我现在没去发展的那些才能。”你现在就在为你的“来”生布置舞台。你今日所思，不管怎么样总会变成造就你下一生的料子。没有神咒可令你聪明，可使你充满了了解和慈悲，可以扩展你的意识。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It is useless then to say, “When this life is over I will look back upon my experience and mend my ways.” This is like a young man saying, “When I grow old and retire, I will use all those abilities that I am not now developing.” You are setting the stage for your “next” life now. The thoughts you think today will in one way or another become the fabric of your next existence. There are no magic words that will make you wise, that will fill you with understanding and compassion, that will expand your consciousness.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(9:58)你的思想和每日的经验包含了那答案。在此生的任何成功、任何能力都是由过去经验中努力获得的，它们理当属于你，你曾努力工作以发展它们。如果你看看身边的亲人、朋友、熟人和事业上来往的人，你也可以看出你是个怎么样的人，因为“物以类聚”，你们彼此吸引，由于非常基本的内在相似处。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(9:58.) Your thoughts and everyday experience contain the answers. Any successes in this life, any abilities, have been worked out through past experience. They are yours by right. You worked to develop them. If you look about you at your relatives, friends, acquaintances, and business associates, you will also see what kind of a person you are, for you are drawn to them as they are drawn to you, through very basic inner similarities.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如果在一天中不同的时候，你花五分钟检查一下你的思想，一个月做好几次，你就的确会对你到此为止自己安排的下一生是哪种生活，收到一个正确的印象。如果你不喜欢你所发现的，那你最好开始改变你的思想和情感的本质。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>If you examine your thoughts for five minutes at various times during the day for several times a month, you will indeed receive a correct impression of the kind of life you have so far arranged for yourself in the next existence. If you are not pleased with what you discover, then you had better begin changing the nature of your thoughts and feelings.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如你在本书后面一点会看到的，你能做得到。没有规定说，在每一生中你必须再遇见以前所认识的人。但由于同类相吸的天性，事实却往往如此。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>As you will see later in this book, you can do so. There is no rule saying that in each life you must meet again those whom you have known before; and yet through the nature of attraction, that is often the case.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们可以休息一下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may take your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“谢谢你喔。”我开着玩笑。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Thank you.” I was kidding.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(幽默地：)因为你是我这么好的朋友，我不叫你一直忙着。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Humorously): I do not keep you busy all the time, because you are such a good friend.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“感激不尽。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Thanks a lot.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:04。珍的步调很好，停顿很少。在休息时我们四人谈到上周六晚上的活动：我们跳完舞后，又在托比的酒吧与烤肉店享用辣香肠胡椒三明治来结束那个晚上。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:04. Jane’s pace had been good, with few pauses. During break the four of us talked about our activities of last Saturday night: After dancing we wound up the evening with hot sausage and pepper sandwiches at Toby’s Bar and Grill. Resume at 11:15.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：我可比不过香肠三明治但是你们现在并没有香肠三明治。我们继续口述吧。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: I can’t compete with a sausage sandwich ---- but then, you do not have a sausage sandwich now. We will continue dictation.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你生在你现在这个家庭里也许有很多理由。但在你死后，你也许会发现与过去某一生的某个人有更强的情感关系。举例来说，如果你结了婚，而与你的配偶并不真正的融洽，那么在死后你也许会发现一个过去的太太或丈夫在等着你。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You may be born into your present family for many reasons. You may find after death a much stronger relationship emotionally with a personality from a past life. If you are married, for example, and have no true rapport with your mate, you may instead find a past wife or husband waiting for you.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">常常，形形色色的团体——军事团体、教会团体、狩猎团体——的成员会在另一生中形成家属关系，然后再以新的方式解决他们旧的问题。必须把家庭视为心灵活动的完形；家庭本身有一个主观的身份，这团体中却没有任一个成员对此点有所觉知。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Oftentimes members of various groups ---- military groups, church groups, hunting groups, will in another life form family relationships in which they will then work out old problems in new ways. Families must be considered as gestalts of psychic activity; they have a subjective identity, of which no particular member of the group may be aware.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">家庭都具有潜意识的目的，虽然家庭中的单独成员可能会追求这些标的却完全不自觉。可以说，这种团体事前在两次肉体存在之间便已设立。往往四或五个人为他们自己设定某一项挑战，而分配给每个成员不同的角色去扮演。然后在一次具体的存在中，演出这些角色。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Families have subconscious purposes, though the individual members of the family may pursue these goals without conscious awareness. Such groups are set up ahead of time, so to speak, in between physical existences. Oftentimes four or five individuals will set themselves a given challenge, and assign to the various members different parts to play. Then in a physical existence the roles will be worked out.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">“内我”对这些家庭完形背后隐藏的机制总是知觉的。那些曾被情感紧紧绑在一起的人，常喜欢在许多生中维持或亲或疏的实质关系。不过，新的关系总是被鼓励的，因为你可以有向内扩大的转世“家庭”。这些“家庭”有许多形成了实质的组织，那实际上是内在集团的外在显现。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The inner self is always aware of the hidden mechanisms of these family gestalts. Those who have been closely bound through emotional ties often prefer to remain in closely tied or loosely tied physical relationships that continue through many lifetimes. New relationships are always encouraged however, for you can have ingrown reincarnational “families.” Many of these form physical organizations that are actually manifestations of inner groupings.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">先前我说到对于“对错”的死板观念，只有一个办法避免这个问题。只有真正的慈悲和爱，才能导致对善的本质有所了解，也只有这些品质能用以消减对恶的错误而歪曲的观念。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I spoke earlier of rigid concepts of right and wrong. There is only one way to avoid this problem. Only true compassion and love will lead to an understanding of the nature of good, and only these qualities will serve to annihilate the erroneous and distortive concepts of evil.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:28)简单的事实是，只要你们一日相信“恶”这个观念，它在你们的系统内就是一个真实的存在，你们总会发现它示现出来。因此，你们对它的相信看起来非常合理。如果你们带着这观念经过以后的世世代代、经过转世，那你们就增加了它的真实性。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:28.) The simple fact is that as long as you believe in the concept of evil, it is a reality in your system, and you will always find it manifested. Your belief in it will, therefore, seem highly justified. If you carry this concept through succeeding generations, through reincarnations, then you add to its reality.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">让我试着阐明我试想告诉你们的。首先，爱永远牵涉到自由。如果一个人说他爱你，却不给你自由，那么你往往会恨他。但因他所说的，你又不认为你有理由恨他。这类情感的纠缠不清本身能导致好多生的持续纠葛。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Let me try to throw some light upon what I am trying to tell you. First of all, love always involves freedom. If a man says he loves you and yet denies you your freedom, then you often Hate him. Yet because of his words you do not feel justified in the emotion. This sort of emotional tangle itself can lead to continued entanglements through various lives.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如果你恨恶，那就要小心你对“恨”那个字的观念。“恨”会局限你，把你的感知弄狭窄。它的确像一面黑暗的玻璃，使你所有的经验都染上阴影。你将发现你恨的东西越来越多，而且把所恨的因素带入了你自己的经验。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>If you Hate evil, then beware of your conception of the word. Hate is restrictive. It narrows down your perception. It is indeed a dark glass that shadows all of your experience. You will find more and more to Hate, and bring the Hated elements into your own experience.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">举例来说，如果你恨父母，那你变得很容易恨任何父母，因为在他们脸上，你看到并投射了那最初触犯你的人。在接下去的生生世世中，你也可能被吸引投生在一个令你发生同样情感的家庭里，因为那情感即为问题所在，而非那些似乎惹起它的因素。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: If, for example, you Hate a parent, then it becomes quite easy to Hate any parents, for in their faces you see and project the original offender. In subsequent lives you may also be drawn into a family and find yourself with the same emotions, for the emotions are the problem, and not those elements that seem to bring them about.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如果你恨疾病，你也许会给自己带来患病的来世，因为那恨把它吸引到你那儿。如果反过来你感觉……</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>If you Hate illness you may bring upon yourself a succeeding life of illness, because the Hate has drawn it to you. If instead you feel….</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:35。珍，身为赛斯，忽然中断了。我们的猫威立从假寐中醒来，跳上了她怀里。我把它抓起来，但它的爪子抓到珍的腿，使她脱离了出神状态。我把威立放进壁柜里。珍安静地坐着，然后继续口述。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:35. Jane, as Seth, broke off. Our cat, Willy, waking up from a snooze, leaped up into her lap. I picked him up, but his claws on Jane’s leg brought her out of trance. I put Willy in the closet. Jane sat quietly, then resumed dictation.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如果你扩展你的爱、健康与存在的感觉，那你在此生以来生中就被吸向那些品质；再次的，因为它们是你所专注的事。痛恨战争的一代(珍看着卡尔)并不会带来和平。爱好和平的一代才会带来和平。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: If you expand your sense of love, of health, and existence, then you are drawn in this life and in others toward those qualities; again, because they are those upon which you concentrate. A generation that Hates war (Jane looked at Carl) will not bring peace. A generation that loves peace will bring peace.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不论为了任何主义、人民或任何理由怀恨而死，都会吃大亏。你现在有各种机会以更有利的方式来重创你的个人经验，并改变你的世界。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>To die with Hatred for any cause or people, or for any reason, is a great disadvantage. You have all kinds of opportunities now to recreate your personal experience in more beneficial ways, and to change your world.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在下一生里，你将以你现在的那些态度来做事。如果你现在坚持怀恨在心，你非常可能继续这样做。在另一方面来说，那些现在所获得点点滴滴的真理、直觉、爱、快乐、创造力和成就在那时候将有助于你，就像现在一样。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In the next life you will be working with those attitudes that are now yours. If you insist upon harboring Hatreds within you now, you are very likely to continue doing so. On the other hand, those sparks of truth, intuition, love, joy, creativity, and accomplishment gained now, will work for you then as they do now.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你明白吗？它们是唯一真相。它们是存在的唯一真正的基石。像鲁柏有次说，恨一个暴风雨或是对它摇拳头咒骂是愚蠢的。如果你想到小孩子或土人做这种事你会发笑。把暴风雨拟人化而当它是个恶魔，专注于它的破坏性因子，或那些在你看来是破坏性的因子，是无用的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They are, you see, the only true realities. They are the only real foundations of existence. It is foolish, as Ruburt once said, to Hate a storm or shake your fists at it and call it names. You laugh if you think of children or natives in such activities. It is useless to personify a storm and treat it as a demon, focusing upon its destructive elements, or those elements that to you appear destructive.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">形式的改变并不是破坏性的。暴风雨的爆炸性能量是极具创造性的。意识不会被消灭。暴风雨是创造力的一部分。你们都由自己的角度去看它，只不过一个人会感觉到在暴风雨内创造力的无穷循环，另外一个人则将之拟人化当作是魔鬼的杰作。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Change of form is not destructive. The explosive energy of a storm is highly creative. Consciousness is not annihilated. A storm is part of creativity. You view it from your own perspective, and yet one individual will feel within the storm the unending cycle of creativity, and another will personify it as the work of the devil.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">透过你所有的生生世世，你都会以自己的方式来诠释你所见的实相，而那方式会对你造成影响，依序也会影响他人。一个真的怀恨的人，立即让他自己变成了这样：他按照自己有限的了解去预先判断实相的本质。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Through all your lives you will interpret the reality that you see in your own way, and that way will have its effect upon you, and in turn upon others. The man who literally Hates, immediately sets himself up in this fashion: He prejudges the nature of reality according to his own limited understanding.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在这谈转世的一章里，我特别强调“恨”这个问题，因为它的结果可能如此的悲惨。一个怀恨的人总相信自己有理如此，他绝不恨任何他相信是好的东西。所以，他认为他恨得很公正，但这“恨”本身会把他据为已有，生生世世地跟随他，直到他学到只有恨本身才是毁灭者。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now I am emphasizing the issue of Hate in this chapter on reincarnation because its results can be so disastrous. A man who Hates always believes himself justified. He never Hates anything that he believes to be good. He thinks he is being just, therefore, in his Hatred, but the Hatred itself forms a very strong claim that will follow him throughout his lives, until he learns that only the Hatred itself is the destroyer.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在你们可以休息一会儿。开始闲聊吧，我会听着。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now you may take your break. Begin your chatter and I will listen.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好的。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Okay.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你懂得我说的这些吗？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Are you following me in this material?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“没问题，你为什么问？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Sure. Why do you ask?”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(幽默地，向前倾：)你们是我的第一个读者。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Humorously, leaning forward): You are my first reader.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:51。休息时间在苏和卡尔的笑声中开始。珍的步调大半时间都很快。在11:08以同样方式继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:51. Break came, to the laughter of Sue and Carl. Jane’s pace had been fast most of the time. Resume at 11:08 in the same manner.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：我绝无意打断你们有益教化的对话。记住你们所专注的话题，留待以后再谈吧。现在我们继续口述。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Far be it from me to interrupt your edifying conversation. Remember what you concentrate upon, and we will leave it at that. Now we will resume dictation.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我想说清楚，去恨这“恨”也没有好处，你还是落入同样的陷阱。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I would like to make it clear that there is nothing to be gained, either, by hating Hatred. You fall into the same trap.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不论你能否感知到“恶”被化为创造力的方法，所需要的是：对生命力本质的基本信赖，并且有信心，相信经验的所有成分都会被利用去达到更大的善。你所爱的在此生与在其他生生世世中，也都会成为你经验的一部分。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>What is needed is a basic trust in the nature of vitality, and faiththat all elements of experience are used for a greater good, whether or not you can perceive the way in which “evil” is transmuted into creativity. What you love will also be a part of your experience in this life and others.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">该记住的最重要概念是：没有人把任一生的经验抛在你身上。它是忠实地按照你自己的情感与信念而形成的。(身为赛斯，珍有力地传述这资料，她的步调快速。)由你的存在这个简单的事实里就可以明显地看出，爱和创造的伟大力量与能量。这就是常被遗忘的真理——意识与存在(的组合)继续下去并且吸收了那些在你看来似如此具破坏的成分。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The most important idea to be remembered is that no one thrusts the experience of any given lifetime upon you. It is formed faithfully according to your own emotions and beliefs. (As Seth, Jane delivered this material vigorously, her pace rapid.) The great power and energy of love and creativity is apparent in the mere fact of your existence. This is the truth so often forgotten ---- that [the combination of] consciousness and existence continues and absorbs those elements that seem to you so destructive.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在11:13停顿。)如果你相信恨，恨的确很有力量，但你虽恨生命，你仍将继续存在。你们每一个人都曾订下约会，而后忘了它。它们是在你诞生入这个存在之前就签好字的，可以这样说。因此在许多情形，你所交的朋友，早在你此生遇见他们之前，已与他们很亲近了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 11:13.) Hate is powerful if you believe in it, and yet though you Hate life, you will continue to exist. You have made appointments, each of you, that you have forgotten. They were signed, so to speak, before you were born in this existence. In many cases the friends that you make were close to you long before you met them in this present life.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这并不表示，在你目前的交往关系中的每一个人都是你以前就认识的，而当然它也不暗示一张令人厌烦的唱片在一遍又一遍地重播，因为每次相遇以其方式来说都是新的。请回想一下我所说的关于家庭转世的情形，而领悟到一个村镇可能也是由其他这样的村镇的过去居民所组成，带着新的经验与背景移居到此。当这团体在尝试不同的实验时，就可能这样做。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>This does not mean that every one in your present acquaintanceship has been known to you, and it certainly does not imply a boring record played over and over again, for each encounter is a new one in its own way. Remembering what I said about families, realize also that towns and villages may also be composed of the past inhabitants of other such towns and villages, transposed with new experiences and backgrounds, as the group tries different experiments.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">且说有些时候也有这样的变化：现在的某一特定城镇的居民，可能是曾居于1632年一个爱尔兰小村的居民转生而来。他们可能是换到爱达荷州的一个镇里。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now sometimes, there are also such variations in that the inhabitants of a particular town now may be the reborn inhabitants of those who lived, say, in 1632 in a small Irish village. They may be transposed to a town in Idaho.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">有些想由“旧世界”旅行到“新世界”的人，可能在“新世界”中转生，你们也必须记住前生的才能在此生也可以供你使用。你收获自己的回报。有关这些事的资料常在你的睡眠状态中给你，有一种完形的梦，一种“根源梦”，过去生生世世中彼此相识的人现在它来沟通。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Some who wanted to travel from the Old World to the New, may be reborn in the new one. You must remember also that abilities from past lives are at your disposal for your present use. You reap your own rewards. Information concerning these is often given to you in the sleep state, and there is a kind of gestalt type of dream, a root dream, by which those who have known each other in past lives now communicate.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在这种梦中，给了一般性的“大众资料”，个人然后照他们所愿的去用它。好比说，当一个镇的团体成员们决定那个镇的命运时，就放出了整体的发展计划。有些人总是选择诞生为某个团体的一份子——换言之，与过去同时代的人一起转生，而同时另一些人则轻视这种作法，而以孤立得多的姿态回来。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In such dreams, general mass-information is given, that the individuals then use as they desire. Overall plans for development are made, as the group members, say, of a town decide upon its destiny. Some individuals always choose to be born as a part of some group ---- reborn, in other words, with past contemporaries, while others, disdaining such endeavors, return in much more isolated positions.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(11:25)这是个心理上的感觉问题。有些人在这种情况下比较轻松、比较有信心、也比较能与其他人合作。你可以拿下例来作个比方：小杜跟着他的幼稚园同班同学一直同班到高中毕业，在一个转世的情况下，他总会选择与同伴们一道回来。可是，其他人就情愿由一个学校跳到另一个学校，独来独往，而且相对来说，有更大的自由、更多的挑战，但是他们没有其他人选择的那种让人舒服的安全架构。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(11:25.) This is a matter of psychological feeling. Some individuals are more at ease, more assured, and more capable working with others in this case. You could consider an analogy in which John Doe follows his kindergarten class all the way through high school. In a reincarnational situation, he would always choose to return with associates. Others, however, would rather skip from school to school, appearing alone, relatively speaking, with greater freedom, more challenge, but without the comforting framework of security chosen by the others.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在每种情形下，个人才是审判者，不只是接续的每一世，它的时间、环境与历史日期的审判者，也是每一世的整体特性和实现方法的审判者。因此有多少个内我，就有多少种不同的转世方式，而每个内我会选择自己个别的方法。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In each case the individual is the judge, not only of each succeeding life, its time, environment, and historical date, but also of its overall character and methods of accomplishment. There are as many different ways to reincarnate, therefore, as there are inner selves, and each inner self will choose its own characteristic methods.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这章既已开始。我就可以结束此节了。我有个感觉，我们无论如何都会有些额外的课。祝我在这儿的朋友晚安；当你俩下次再出游时(赛斯曾助卡尔和苏作灵体旅行)，我希望你们随身带着你们的记忆力——你(对我)也一样。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I will end our session now that the chapter is begun. I have the feeling that we will have some extra sessions in any case. I wish my friends over here a hearty good evening; and when you both travel next (Seth has been helping Carl and Sue with astral travel), I hope you bring your memories along with you ---- and (to me) you too.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好吧。赛斯晚安，谢谢。”</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Okay. Good evening, Seth, and thank you.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(11:34。珍的出神状态一直很深，她的眼睛非常大而黑。她告诉我们：“赛斯仍在这儿。”</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(11:34. Jane’s trance had been deep, her eyes very wide and dark. “Seth is still around,” she told us.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(现在我们四人之间开始了一个起劲的对话。苏提起人口过多的问题。她奇怪怎可能如此：如果某一个数目的“本体”负责我们物质世界的创造，那么额外的人是由哪儿来的？我告诉她，按赛斯所说，组成本体的每一个人格，能随它选择要多少次以肉体形象显示它自己。然后在11:40赛斯打断了我们。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(A spirited conversation sprang up now between the four of us. Sue brought up the question of overpopulation. How can this be, she wondered: If a certain number of entities were responsible for the creation of our physical world, where do the extra human beings come from? I told her that, according to Seth, each personality making up an entity could manifest itself physically as often as it chose to. Seth then interrupted us at 11:40.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：等我们一会儿。(停顿。)首先，作为一个种族，以普通的说法，你们把自己认作是与其余的自然和意识分离的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Give me a moment here. (Pause.) First of all, as a species, in the context of normal usage, you have considered yourselves as apart from the rest of nature and consciousness.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们自己族类的幸存是你们最主要关切的。对别的物类你们只考虑它们对你们有什么用而已。你们对所有意识的伟大神圣性，以及你们在其中的关系并无任何真正的观念。你们对那伟大的真理是越来越不了解了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Your own survival as a species was your main concern. You considered other species only in the light of their use to you. You did not have any true conception of the great sacredness of all consciousness, nor of your relationship within it. You were losing your grasp of that great truth.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在目前的情况里，你们仍在继续那个概念——只管人类的幸存而无视其后果，即改变环境以适合你们自己的目的；这会导致你们不顾灵性的真理。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In the present circumstances you are carrying that idea forward ---- of species survival regardless of the consequences, the idea of changing the environment to suit your own purposes; and this has led you to a disregard of spiritual truths.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">因此，在物质实相里，你们正看见其结果。且说，那些回到人间来的人，是为了好些种不同的理由而回来的。有些便是因为这种态度而被人世生活所吸引。他们是那些在你们所谓的过去为肉体存在奋争、而不顾其他物种权利的人。他们因受自己欲望的驱使而回来。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In physical reality, therefore, you are seeing the results. Now those personalities who are returning are doing so for various reasons. Some of them are drawn to physical life again because of these attitudes. They are those who in the past, in your terms, strove for physical existence without consideration for the rights of other species. They are driven to return because of their own desires.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">人类必须学会尊重个人的价值。人类也在学它对其他物类的依赖，而开始理解它在物质实相整个架构中的角色。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The species must learn the value of the individual man. The species is also learning its dependence upon other species, and beginning to comprehend its part in the whole framework in physical reality.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在：有一些人在这个时代诞生，只是为了要帮助你们了解真相。他们在逼你们面对问题，逼你们面对危机，因为你们仍有时间来改变你们的方式。你们正在努力解决两个主要问题，但两者都涉及了个人的神圣性，以及个人与他人和所有实体取向意识之间的关系。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Some individuals are being reborn at this time simply to help you understand. They are forcing the issue, and forcing the crisis, for you still have time to change your ways. You are working on two main problems, but both involve the sacredness of the individual, and the individual’s relationship with others and with all physically oriented consciousness.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">战争的问题早晚会教你们，当你杀了另一个人，基本上结果是你在杀自己。人口过剩的问题也会教你，如果你对所居住的环境没有一种关爱之情，它将不再供养你——你们不配得到它。你懂吗？你们不会毁灭这行星，你们不会毁灭花鸟、五谷或动物。是你们配不上它们而它们会毁灭你们。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The problem of war will sooner or later teach you that when you kill another man, basically you will end up killing yourself. The over-population problem will teach you that if you do not have a loving concern for the environment in which you dwell, it will no longer sustain you ---- you will not be worthy of it. You will not be destroying the planet, you see. You will not be destroying the birds or the flowers, or the grain or the animals. You will not be worthy of them, and they will be destroying you.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你们在你们的参考架构内为自己设立这问题。除非等到你们确实看到自己有把“自然架构”撕破的危险，才能了解你们在自然架构内的角色。你们不会毁灭意识，纵使是一片叶子的意识，你们也无法消灭，但就你们的情形而论，如果问题没解决，这些意识都将由你们的经验中消褪。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You have set up the problem for yourselves within the framework of your reference. You will not understand your part within the framework of nature until you actually see yourselves in danger of tearing it apart. You will not destroy consciousness. You will not annihilate the consciousness of even one leaf, but in your context, if the problem were not solved, these would fade from your experience.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不过，这危机也是一种治疗法。它是你们因为自己需要而设的一种教学方法。在你们人类出发到其他的物质实相去以前，你们现在就需要它。现在，在你们还没旅游到其他世界之前，你们必须在自己的后院里学到教训。因此你们为了那个目的而把这问题惹到自己身上，你们会学到的。(在11:55结束此节。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The crisis is a kind of therapy, however. It is a teaching method that you have set up for yourselves because you need it. And you need it now, before your species embarks upon journeys to other physical realities. You must learn your lessons now in your own backyard before you travel to other worlds. So you have brought this upon yourself for that purpose and you will learn.
