<div style="display:inline">第578节</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>SESSION 578, APRIL 5, 1971,</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">1971年4月5日 星期一 晚上9：30</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>9:30 P.M. MONDAY</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(如赛斯在上节指示的，我编好了为这章的一张问题单。它并不完全，但令人惊奇的，已经有了五页打字纸与约五十二个问题。我提出了许多问题，但也与珍商议过。这单子包括了苏·华京斯以前提出来的许多有趣问题中的一些，我也把这些存了下来，和我们自己及他人对有关各种老课程所提的问题放在一起。我们认为，所有的问题都有一种无时间性的特质。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(As instructed by Seth in the last session, I had compiled a list of questions for this chapter. It wasn’t complete but, surprisingly, it already ran to five typed pages and some fifty-two items. I contributed a lot of them, but also consulted with Jane. The list included some of the many interesting questions Sue Watkins· had asked; we had saved these, along with those raised by ourselves and others in connection with various older sessions. All of the questions, we thought, had a timeless quality.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(今天稍早我曾告诉珍，我怕这些问题对本书并不十分有代表性，而要编组一个真正恰当的问题清单需要对每一章有密切的研究。当然，我们并没这样做——部分由于时间限制；部分因为珍不想那么有意识地涉入。我们只能希望，凭着直觉这会是个适当的清单。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Earlier today I told Jane that I was afraid the questions weren’t very representative of Seth’s book, and that to assemble a truly relevant list of them would require an intimate study of each chapter. This we hadn’t done, of course ---- partly because of time limitations; partly because Jane hadn’t wanted to be that involved consciously. We were left hoping that intuitively the list would be an appropriate one.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(几乎已成惯例，我们在九点坐下来等课开始，但赛斯不像平时那样准时出现。当时间过去，珍说她想她是因为这些问题而有些紧张；在晚餐后她看过它们。为了较有私密性，这节在我的画室举行。终于，珍取下了她的眼镜。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(We sat for the session at 9:00, as we almost always do, but Seth didn’t appear with his usual promptness. As the time passed, Jane said she thought she was somewhat uptight because of the questions; she had read them after supper. The session was held in my studio for more privacy. Finally, Jane took off her glasses.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在:晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: Good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯晚安。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(幽默地：)就以你们精彩的问题清单开始。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Humorously): Begin with your famous list of questions.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“哦，首先让我读单子开头的一段给你听：这里面有些问题也许与你预备在以后几章中要谈的主题相关。若是如此，请让我们知道，我们就把它跳过去不在这章考虑。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Well, first I’ll read you this paragraph heading the list: Some of these questions may refer to subjects you plan to cover in later chapters. If so, let us know and we’ll just pass them by for consideration in this chapter.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">一言为定。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I will indeed.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好吧。这儿是第一个问题：你说过你会告诉我们有关第三位基督的事。还有，我们需不需要对属于基督存有(entity)的其他两人——基督自己与施洗约翰——知道得更多？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Okay. Here’s question number one: You said you’d tell us about the third Christ. Also, do we need to know more about the other two personalities belonging to the Christ entity: Christ Himself, and John the Baptist?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在暂不谈宗教的问题。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Let the religious questions go for now.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“那包不包括‘说法者’的资料？”我打算问几个关于‘说法者’的问题。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Does that include data on the Speakers?” I planned to ask several questions about the Speakers.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">不——只是有关世界宗教的问题及那些关于第三位基督和有关的题目。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>No ---- just the questions about the world religions, and those pertaining to the third Christ and allied subjects.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好吧，第二个问题：珍在替你说话时，说有成千上万‘说法者’的声明是正确的吗？或是扭曲了的？”见第十七章第568节。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“All right, question number two: Was the statement given by Jane, while speaking for you, correct, that there have been millions of Speakers? Or was this distorted?” See the 568th session, in Chapter Seventeen.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">它没被扭曲。“说法者”按照他们自己的个性而被赋予不同才华，有些比另一些能力要大得多，但他们全都在内在资料的传播上扮演一角。因此，以你们的话来说，有些“说法者”会比另一些要有成就得多。举例来说，真正重要的“说法者”数目比所给的数目要少得多。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>It was not distorted. The Speakers are gifted according to their own characters, some having far more abilities than others, but all playing roles in the communication of inner data. In your terms, therefore, some Speakers would be much more accomplished than others. For example, there have been a far smaller number of truly prominent Speakers than the number given.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">伟大的“说法者”还不到三十个。请等我们一会儿。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There have been less than thirty great Speakers. Give us time here.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在9:35停顿。珍的步调相当慢。)基督存有是一个，佛陀是另一个。这些“说法者”当他们没有肉身时与有肉身时一样活跃。基督存有在出现为所谓基督“人格”(personality)前有过许多次转世；佛陀亦如是。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 9:35. Jane’s pace was quite slow.) The Christ entity was one. The Buddha was another. These Speakers are as active when they are nonphysical as when they are physical. The Christ entity had many reincarnations before the emergence of the Christ “personality” as known; as did the Buddha.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">最伟大的“说法者”不只是转译与传播内在资料，并且和你们物质系统相连的其他说法者比起来，他们还更深入这些实相的内在领域。于是他们增益了基本的内在资料。最伟大的“说法者”不需要大多数人所必须的密集训练。他们独特的特性组合使这成为不必要的。(停顿，许多次停顿之一。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The greatest Speakers do not only translate and communicate inner data, but also go much further into these inner realms[realms] of reality than others connected with your physical system. They add, then, to the basic inner data. The greatest Speakers have not needed the intensive training necessary for most. Their unique combination of characteristics has made this unnecessary. (Pause. One of many.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在另一层次上，爱默生(Emerson)也是个“说法者”。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>At another level, Emerson was a Speaker.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">一个名叫毛本都(我的拼音)的人……</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>A man named Marbundu…. (My phonetic interpretation.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“你要不要把它拼出来？“)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Do you want to spell that?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">M-A-U-B-U-N-D-U，在纪元前十四世纪的非洲。在所有各种的存在状态中，“说法者”比大多数人都更活跃得多，不论这些存在状态是物质或非物质的、醒或睡的、在两世之间或在实相的其他层面。就像某些肉体资料是由遗传因子的结构所传递，因此这内在资料也是以密码方式保存于那“说法者”所居住的不论哪种心理结构之内；但是远比其他人格要容易取得。不过它常常需要“触机”才能释放出来。这种“触机”可以在醒时或梦境中发生，而它们的用处是打开知识的库藏，并使过去的训练可以被用上。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>M-A-U-B-U-N-D-U, in Africa, 14 B.C. The Speakers, more than most, are highly active through all aspects of existence, whether physical or nonphysical, waking or sleeping, between lives or at other levels of reality. As certain physical data are carried along in the gene structure, so this inner information is codified within whatever psychological structures the Speakers may inhabit; but far more readily available than it is to other personalities. It needs, often, trigger points to release it, however. These can take place in either the waking or dream state, and they serve to open up the reservoirs of knowledge and make past training available.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我知道你有个关乎第一个“说法者”的问题。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I know that one of your questions has to do with a first Speaker.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“是的。第四个问题：是否可以指出第一个‘说法者’的名字，或形容他？)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Yes. Number four: Is it possible to name, or describe, a first Speaker?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">较广义地说，并没有第一个“说法者”。想像你在同一刻身在十个地方，而你真的把你自己的一部分派到这十个地方的每一处去。想像你可以把自己分身到那十个方向，而十部分中的每一个都是有意识、警醒而有觉察的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now: In greater terms, there was no first Speaker. Imagine that you wanted to be ten places at once, and that you actually sent one portion of yourself to each of these ten places. Imagine that you could scatter yourself in those ten directions, and that each of the ten portions were conscious, alert, and aware.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你——作为十个的你——在这十个地方的每处都会觉察到你的存在。不可能问十个中哪个最先到，除了说那决定拜访十处的起始者开始了一切。“说法者”就是如此的，同样他们也不是在他们可能出现的某时某地起始的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>You ---- being the ten of you ---- would be aware of existence in each of the ten places. It would be impossible to ask which of the ten arrived first, except to say that all began with the original who decided to visit the ten locations. So it is with the Speakers, who in the same way do not originate in the locations or in the times in which they may appear.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你还有其他“说法者”问题吗？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Do you have more Speaker questions?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“嗯，那带来第三个问题，即你已开始谈到的：‘说法者’资料的原始来源是什么？它由何处何时而来？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Well, that brings me to number three, which you’ve already been getting into: What is the original source of the Speaker data? Where did it come from, and when?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">“说法者”资料的原始来源是每个人本自具足关于实相本质的内在知识。“说法者”就是要保持这些资讯活在世间，要负责不让人把它埋在内而阻塞了它，要把它——这些“法”——带到有意识自己的注意之下。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The original source of the Speaker data is the inner knowledge of the nature of reality that is within each individual. The Speakers are to keep the information alive in physical terms, to see that men do not bury it within and dam it up, to bring it ---- the information ---- to the attention of the conscious self.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">换言之，他们说出内在的秘密。实际地说，如此书稍早提到过的，在有些文明里，他们扮演一个更为重要的角色。有时他们是一直有意识的、“自我中心地”觉知到这些资讯，就是在那时它被记住了。他们悟到它在一个无意识层面是永远可以得到的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They speak the inner secrets, in other words. In some civilizations, as mentioned earlier in this book, they played a much stronger part, practically speaking. At times they were consistently, consciously and egotistically aware of this information. It was then that it was memorized. They realized it was always available at an unconscious level.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">可是，他们利用记忆把资讯印在肉体的大脑上。无论如何对他们而言，在内在与外在存在之间，一直都有很大的交互作用，就如今日也有的一样。在梦境所获的有意义资讯在早晨被记住了。一个“说法者”在梦境帮另一个复习“功课”。在另一方面，恰当的物质资料也在梦境由一个传给另一个，两种状态都被高度利用。(停顿。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They imprinted it, however, upon the physical brain through the use of memory. There was always great interaction however between inner and outer existence for them, as there is today. Valid information gained in the dream state was memorized in the morning. One Speaker heard another’s lesson in the dream state. On the other hand, pertinent physical data was also communicated one to another in the dream state, and both states were utilized to a high degree. (Pause.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你还有更多“说法者”的问题吗？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Do you have any more Speaker questions?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“第五：门徒中有‘说法者’吗？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Number five: Were any of the disciples Speakers?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我把这个保留给谈宗教的那章。可以更简单地处理它。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I will save that one for the religious chapter. It can be handled more simply.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“第六：‘说法者’在两世之间时可否与我们合作？)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Number six: Can Speakers work with us while they are between physical lives?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我相信那已经回答过了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I believe that has been answered.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“是的。”看在9:35的资料。我这么忙着写字，以致没悟到这问题已被考虑过了。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Yes.” See the data at 9:35. I was so busy writing I didn’t realize the question had already been considered.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他们能，而且的确在这样做。你俩都正在被两世之间的其他“说法者”训练，这发生在你们的梦境里。那些“说法者”自己所达到各自的效率显然程度各不相同。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They can, and do indeed. Both of you are being trained by other Speakers who are themselves between lives, this occurring in your dream states. The Speakers themselves obviously attain varying degrees of efficiency.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(当然，以上的资料引起更多的问题：好比说谁在训练我们？我们在前世认识他们吗？等等。我不知该怎么办，就没问问题……)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(And of course, the above data gives rise to more questions: such as who is training us? Have we known them in past lives, etc.? Not knowing what to do, I asked no questions….)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他们的工作大部分是在非实质状态下完成的，尘世的生活有些像是很重要的实地考察旅行(field trips)。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The large amount of their work is done from a nonphysical state, earthly existences being somewhat like very important field trips.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“第七：你在这书中会谈到赛斯二吗？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Number seven: Are you going to talk about Seth II in this book?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我的确会。我们现在暂且不谈那个。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I am indeed. We will leave that one for now.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在此赛斯与我有个对话，我不必把它记下来。赛斯说这章的目的是换换口味，不再长篇大论的口述。它也是设计来叫读者想想他自己的问题。“那么我猜你也要等会儿再管第八个问题：你是否为赛斯二的灵媒？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Here there was an exchange between Seth and me, in which I didn’t have to take notes. Seth said this chapter was intended as a change of pace from the long excerpts included in the book. It was also designed to make the reader think of his own questions. “Then I suppose you’ll want to handle question number eight later, too: Are you a medium for Seth II?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">也等以后再谈。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Also later.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“第十一：在第十七章里，你说在珍能传述一篇‘说法者’的稿子之前，她需要更多的训练。而即使在那时，所涉及的工作也可能要花上五年时间。是哪一种训练？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Number eleven: In Chapter Seventeen you said it would require more training on Jane’s part before she could deliver a Speaker manuscript, and that even then the work involved could take five years. What kind of training?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我那时说的是特指你会称之为一篇古老“说法者”稿件的东西，而我以为你指的是那个。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I was speaking specifically of what you would term an ancient Speaker’s manuscript, and I thought that was what you were referring to.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“是的。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Yes.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">即使那原始的语言已经经过转译，鲁柏对它所用的字句还是有很多不熟悉的。甚至在基本观念上也有不同。欲维持翻译的纯粹，各种不同的内在感知训练是必要的。这些语言有的是和图画而非文字打交道。在有些资料里那些象征符号有多重次元的意义。经过鲁柏来传递这种资讯会是个极艰巨的任务，但是是可能的。常常文字是隐藏在图画内，而图画又隐于文字内。我们谈到稿子，但这些大半都没写下来。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Ruburt would not be familiar with a good many of the words and phrases used, even if translation from the original languages was made. There is a difference even in some basic concepts. To maintain any purity of translation, training in different kinds of inner perception would be necessary. Some of these languages dealt with pictures rather than words. In some the symbols had multidimensional meanings. To deliver such information through Ruburt would be an immense task, but it is possible. Oftentimes words were hidden within pictures, and pictures within words. We speak of manuscripts, yet most of these were not written down.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">有一些是写下来了，但是在晚得多的时候，有部分存在地下和洞穴里——在澳洲、非洲的一些部分，及比利牛斯山的一区。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Some were, but at much later dates, and portions exist underground and in caves ---- in Australia, parts of Africa, and in one area of the Pyrenees.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在我建议你休息一会儿。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now I suggest your break.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(10:12。珍的步调加快了不少，好像她已失掉了某种紧张。她说现在她对“问答”这种形式觉得自在多了。我也是的。画室凉了不少。珍说她在出神状态时不冷，但现在觉得冷了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(10:12. Jane’s pace had speeded up considerably, as though she had lost some sort of nervousness. She said that now she felt much better about the question-and-answer format. So did I. The studio had cooled off considerably. Jane said she hadn’t been cold in trance, but was now.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(我告诉她在单子上面下一个问题是第九个，是和赛斯在经过她说话时的感知有关，这是从1971年2月9日的ESP班得来的灵感；那一课的摘录包括在第十九章的第575节里。同时我想到另一个“说法者”的问题，我把它写了下来。在10:44继续。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(I told her that question number nine was next on the list. It had to do with Seth’s perceptions while speaking through her, and had been inspired by the ESP class session for February 9, 1971; excerpts from this are included in the 575th session in Chapter Nineteen. In the meantime I thought of another Speaker query, which I wrote down. Resume at 10:40.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在两个问题你要我先答哪一个？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now which of the two questions do you want me to answer first?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“我们就叫这个第十一—a：那么你是否同意这些赛斯课是对珍和我的‘说法者’训练，被提升到了一个有意识的层面？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“We’ll call this eleven-a: Wouldn’t you say then that these sessions are Speaker training for Jane and me, raised to a conscious level?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">它的确是的。以你们的话来说，当一个人到了他最后一次的肉体生活时，这内在资讯必须被有意识地认知(停顿),那么此人格的所有部分在他死时就熟知它〔内在资讯〕了。如此，则此人格不再会不管他愿不愿意就被卷回另一次尘世生活里去，不然的话，那种状况是很可能发生的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They are indeed. The inner information must be consciously recognized. In your terms, by the time an individual is in his last physical life (pause), all portions of the personality are then familiar with it at the time of death. The personality is not swept willy-nilly back to another earthly existence, as might be the case otherwise.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">他自己那个有意识肉身取向的部分变得熟识了内在资讯。到某个程度，他有意识的感知到“思想的实相”是物质背后的创新者。于是这样一个人在死亡那一刻便能了解种种幻觉的本质，而了了分明的进入下一个存在层面。而那些被带到有意识层面的资讯于是便传下去给他人，而能实际地被认知与应用。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>The conscious physically oriented portions of the self become acquainted with the inner information. To some extent the reality of thought is consciously perceived as the innovator behind physical matter. Such an individual then can understand the nature of hallucinations at the point of death, and with full conscious awareness enter into the next plane of existence. The information made conscious is then passed on to others where it can be physically recognized and applied.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">现在，下一个问题。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Now, as to the next question.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“第九：你告诉过我们，你将详谈当你经由珍对满屋子里的人说话时，你感知到什么。在那节ESP课里，你说到你自己进入了一个出神状态，以及你为了要在我们的时空里对准我们所需的努力。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Number nine: You told us you were going to elaborate upon what you perceive when you are speaking through Jane to a roomful of people. In that ESP class session, you mentioned going into a trance yourself, and the effort required by you to pinpoint us in our time and space.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我对一个房间里人们的感知与他们对自己的感知非常不同；我可以知觉他们的各种前世与来生的人格，却无法知觉他们的可能自己。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I perceive people in a room in a far different manner than they perceive themselves; their various past and future reincarnated personalities, but not their probable selves, are perceivable to me.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我“看见”他在转世时所采取的各种面貌。在你们来说好像你在看一组迅速移动的画面，全都代表一个人的各种姿态。在与房间里的那些人沟通时，我必须记住限制我的评论而只贯注在这个特定转世的“现在自己”身上。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I “see” the reincarnated aspects, the various manifestations taken in that regard. In your terms it would be as if you saw a series of quickly moving pictures, all representing various poses of one personality. I must remember, in all communications with those in the room, to limit my remarks and focus to the specific reincarnated “present self.”</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我自己看到这个集锦影像，它并不显现在珍的眼睛上(停顿)，她的眼睛没有必要多次元深度的感知力。不管我是否透过珍的眼在看，我清楚地看到这集锦影像。我用她的眼睛，因为它们替我把焦点缩小到这个人所知觉的“现在自己”身上。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I see this composite image myself. It is not registered by Ruburt’s eyes (pause), which do not have the multidimensional depth perception necessary. I see the composite image clearly, whether or not I am looking through Ruburt’s eyes. I use his eyes because they narrow down the focus for me, to the one “present” self of which the individual is aware.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">这样子与你们的系统沟通，需要极大的努力与更大的辨识力，按照这通讯者与物质系统“距离”的远近而异。好比说，我的基地就不在物质系统内。我必须在一个精准时间，在你贯注于其上的时空精确点进入你们的实相，这需要准确性，而这时就用得上“辨识力”了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Communicating with your system in such a manner demands great diligence and greater discrimination, according to the “distance” of the communicator from the physical system. I am not based within the physical system, for example. The discrimination comes to bear upon the precision needed to enter your reality at the precise time, the precise point in time and space, upon which you are concentrated.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我可得知在屋里那些人现在与未来的经验，就与他们现在的经验一样的真。因此我必须记住什么是他们认为已发生了的，或尚未发生的，因为对我两者为一。可是，这些活动的模式也是一直在变的。例如，我说我知觉到他们过去与未来的行动与思想；实际上我知觉到的，却是永远在变易与变化的模式，包括在未来与在过去的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>Present and future experience of those in the room are available to me, and as real as their present experience. Therefore I must remember what they think has already happened, or not yet occurred, for to me it is one. These patterns of activity, however, are also constantly changing. I say for example that I am aware of their past and future actions and thoughts; and yet what I am aware of, actually, are ever-shifting and changing patterns, both in the future and in the past.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(11:00)有些我看到在未来与这些人明明有关的事情，可能不发生在你们的物质系统里。它们存在为可能性、潜在的，已在思想里实现却未转变成明确的具体形式。我告诉过你没有事情是注定的，我必须对准一个在你们来说的将来日期，而探索它所有的细节分支，才能确定我早先在你之内看到的可能行动哪一个后来会实现。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(11:00.) Some of the events that I see connected very clearly with these persons in the future may not, in your physical system, occur. They exist as Probabilities, as potentials, actualized in thoughts but not turned into definite physical form. I told you that no events were predetermined. I would have to tune into a future date, in your terms, and probe it with all of its ramifications in order to ascertain which of the probable actions I saw in your earlier would be actualized in your later.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">沟通方法可能有很大程度的不同。一个以物质实相为基地的通讯者，好比说，在两世之间的“人”，会发现在许多方面更容易与你们沟通。不过，他能够给的资讯也会因他的经验而受到限制。无论如何，我确有一个人间生活的记忆，在把你们的精神资料转译为物质形式时，这自动的对我有帮助，举例来说，此地利用鲁柏的感官也有很大的帮助。有时我看见这房间和这些人，就像他看见的一样，或不如说像他的感知机制所见的一样。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>To a large extent the methods of communication may vary. A personality based within physical reality, between lives for example, would find entry in many ways easier. The information he would be able to give, however, would also be limited because of his experience. I do have a memory of physical existence however, and this automatically helps me in translating yourmental data into physical form. I do perceive objects, for example. Using Ruburt’s mechanism is of great help here also. At times I see the room and the people as he, or rather his perceptive mechanisms, do.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在这种情形我转译或读那资料。而后像你用一个电脑资料一样的利用它，那有没回答你的问题？</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>In this case I translate or read that data and use it as you might a computer’s. Will that answer your question?</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“棒极了。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Excellent.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">你可以问下一个问题了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I am ready for the next.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“第十：你会不会告诉我们在这些课开始前你接触珍的一些方法？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Number ten: Are you going to tell us about some of the ways you contacted Jane before these sessions began?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">在较早的一章里我已提到一些。作为珍，她大半的训练在梦境里发生。她常在“出体”的情形里去上课，最初是由各种不同的“说法者”来教导。所获的资讯常经由诗而被带到有意识的层面(在11:15停顿很久)。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I mentioned some of that in an earlier chapter. Much of her training, as Jane, took place in the dream state. There were frequent out-of-body projections in which she attended classes, taught initially by various Speakers. The information gained was often brought to conscious layers through the poetry. (Long pause at 11:15.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">密集的训练让她向内对准焦点；一个外在环境逼她向内找寻答案，以及一个很强的宗教背景，在其内最初的成长得以发生。那就够了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>There was concentrated training that allowed her to focus inward; an exterior environment that forced her to look inward for answers, and a strong religious structure in which initial growth could take place. That is enough.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在我大略察看下面第十二、十三、十四三个问题时，停顿了很久。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(A long pause while I scanned the next three questions: twelve, thirteen, and fourteen.)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">如果这是转世的资料，现在先不谈。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>If this is the reincarnational material, let that go for now.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(它是的。我跳到第十九个，一个我几乎懒得写下的问题：“当你不透过珍说话时，你有兴趣感知我们的日常生活吗？它是否可能？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(It was. I skipped down to number nineteen, a question I almost hadn’t bothered to write down. “Do you have any interest in perceiving our daily lives when you’re not speaking through Jane? Is this possible?”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我并没养成观察你们的习惯。可是，我们在我们的心理完形里是相连的，因此我对你那方任何强烈的感觉，或任何一种强烈的反应都有所知。这并不是说我必然觉察你生活中所有的事，或我总是把从你那儿收到的感觉分解成明确的细节。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I do not make it a practice to observe. We are connected, however, in our psychological gestalt, and so I am aware of any intense feelings on your part, or strong reactions of any kind. This does not mean that I am necessarily aware of all events within your lives, or that I always break down the feelings I receive from you into specifics.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(在11:25停顿。)因此，我大体觉察你们的情形。如果任何事扰乱了鲁柏，他会自动地发给我关于它的讯息。在我提到过的限制内，我对你们生活中的未来事件是知道的(停顿)。我对你整个灵魂的活力比对你早餐吃了什么要关心多了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(Pause at 11:25.) I am generally aware, therefore, of your condition. If anything upsets Ruburt, he automatically sends me messages about it. I am aware, within the limitations mentioned, of future events in your lives. (Pause.) I am much more concerned with your overall spiritual vitality than I am with what you had for breakfast.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我想那该答复了你的问题。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I think that will do for that one.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“好的。那很有意思。我不知是要求休息呢或是结束此节？”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Okay. That was very interesting. I don’t know whether to ask for a break or end the session.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我大概要一起处理关于进化与片段体的问题，我建议它们等到下一次。你可以结束此节或休息，随你的便。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I will handle the questions on evolution and fragments probably together, and suggest they wait for the next session. You may end the session or take a break as you prefer.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“那么我猜我们还是结束了吧，抱歉这样说。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“I guess we’d better end it then, sorry to say.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">今天问题很好，我就知道它们会不错的。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>They were good questions, as I knew they would be.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“我本来有点担心。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“I was kind of concerned about them.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我希望你现在放心了。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>I hope you are relieved now.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“是的，我非常高兴。”)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Very pleased, yes.”)</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">我最衷心的祝福，晚安。</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>My heartiest regards, and a fond good evening.</details><br>
<div style="display:inline">(“赛斯，非常感谢你，晚安。”11:30。)</div><details style="color:orange;display:inline"><summary></summary>(“Thank you very much, Seth, and good night.” 11:30 P.M.)</details><br>
