我们回到第二章。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We will return to our Chapter Two.</details>
现在：以一种非常真实的方式，你们所用的感官创造了你们所感知的环境(译注：佛家用语则为五根创造了五尘)。你们的肉体感官使得你们必然感知一个三次元的实相。可是，意识具有内在的感官。这是所有的意识与生俱来的，不论意识发展的程度如何。这些内在感官与某一意识在采用某一特殊化的形式——即如肉体——以便在某一特定系统内运作时所用的感官互不相涉。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: The senses that you use, in a very real manner, create the environment that you perceive. Your physical senses necessitate the perception of a three-dimensional reality. Consciousness is equipped with inner perceptors, however. These are inherent within all consciousness, regardless of its development. These perceptors operate quite independently from those that might be assumed when a given consciousness adopts a specialized form, such as a physical body, in order to operate in a particular system.</details>
因此，每个读者都有内在感官，并且到某个程度经常在用它们，虽然在自我的层面上他并不知道他在这样做。至于我们，则相当自由且有意识地运用内在感官。果真你能这样做，那你便会知觉我生存于其内的那种环境。你会看到一个没有伪装的情况，在其内事件与形式是自由的，而非胶着在一个果冻似的时间模式(mode of time)内。例如，你不仅能看见你目前的客厅好像聚集着一堆看来永恒的家具，而且你能转移焦点，而看到组成各物的分子与其他粒子的极广大而恒常的舞蹈。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Each reader, therefore, has inner senses, and to some extent uses them constantly, though he is not aware of doing so at an egotistical level. Now, we use the inner senses quite freely and consciously. If you were to do so, then you would perceive the same kind of environment in which I have my existence. You would see an uncamouflaged situation, in which events and form were free and not stuck in a jellylike mold of time. You could see, for example, your present living room not only as a conglomeration of permanent-appearing furniture, but switch your focus and see the immense and constant dance of molecules and other particles that compose the various objects.</details>
你能看到一种磷光似的光辉，那组成分子本身电磁“结构”的灵光(aura)。如果你愿意，你能浓缩你的意识，直到它小到能游过一个单分子，而从分子自己的世界向外看，观测这房间的宇宙，以及互相关联、不断变动的星状巨大银河系。现在所有这些可能性代表一个合理的实相。你自己的实相并不比任何其他的更合理，但它是你所见唯一的一个。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You could see a phosphorescent like glow, the aura of electromagnetic “structures” that compose the molecules themselves. You could, if you wished, condense your consciousness until it was small enough to travel through a single molecule, and from the molecule’s own world look out and survey the universe of the room and the gigantic galaxy of interrelated, ever-moving starlike shapes. Now all of these possibilities represent a legitimate reality. Yours is no more legitimate than any other, but it is the only one that you perceive.</details>
运用内在感官，我们就变成有意识的创造者，或共同创造者。但不管你知道与否，你是个无意识的共同创造者。如果我们的环境对你似乎是没有结构的，那是因为你不明白秩序(order)的真实本质，它与永久的形式毫不相干，只是从你的着眼点看来是如此而已。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Using the inner senses, we become conscious creators, cocreators. But you are unconscious cocreators whether you know it or not. If our environment seems unstructured to you, it is only because you do not understand the true nature of order, which has nothing to do with permanent form, but only appears to have form from your perspective.</details>
在我的环境中，没有下午四点或晚上九点。我这样说是指我并不受限于一个时间顺序。但也没有什么能阻止我去体验时间顺序，如果我如此选择的话。我们是按照经验的强度来感受“时间”，或类似时间的东西——一个“心理时间”，具有它自己的高峰与低谷。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There is no four o’clock in the afternoon or nine o’clock in the evening in my environment. By this I mean that I am not restricted to a time sequence. There is nothing preventing me from experiencing such sequences if I choose. We experience time, or what you would call its equivalent nature, in terms of intensities of experience ---- a psychological time with its own peaks and valleys.</details>
当时间仿佛加快或减慢，是与你自己情绪性的感受有些相似的，但在一些重要的地方却有极大的不同。我们的“心理时间”若以环境来比喻，可以比之为房间的墙壁，但在我们的例子，墙壁会不断地改变颜色、尺寸、高度、深度与宽度。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>This is somewhat similar to your own emotional feelings when time seems speeded up or slowed down, but it is vastly different in important ways. Our psychological time could be compared in terms of environment to the walls of a room, but in our case the walls would be constantly changing in color, size, height, depth and width.</details>
实际上说，我们的心理结构之所以不同，在于我们有意识地利用一个多重次元的心理实相，你们天生也拥有这种心理实相，但在自我的层面上却不熟悉它。那么，自然我们的环境会有肉体感官永不能感知的多次元性质。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Our psychological structures are different, practically speaking, in that we consciously utilize a multidimensional Psychological reality that you inherently possess, but are unfamiliar with at an egotistical level. It is natural, then, that our environment would have multidimensional qualities that the physical senses would never perceive.</details>
那么，当我在口述此书时，我将我一部分的现实投射到系统之间一个无区分的层面，那儿比较没有伪装。比较来说它是个不活动的地带，如果你以物质实相来想的话，那么这地带可比之为紧接着你们大气层之上的地方。不过我是在讲心理与心灵的大气层，而这些地带与鲁柏处于肉体的自身离得够远，因此通讯比较可以被了解。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now, I project a portion of my reality as I dictate this book to an undifferentiated level between systems that is relatively clear of camouflage. It is an inactive area, comparatively speaking. If you were thinking in terms of physical reality, then this area could be likened to one immediately above the atmosphere of your earth. However I am speaking of psychological and psychic atmospheres, and this area is sufficiently distant from Ruburt’s physically oriented self so that the communications can be relatively understood.</details>
在某方面来说它也与我自己的环境有距离，因为在我自己的环境里，把资料以偏向物质化的术语加以说明，对我而言会有些困难。你们必须了解这距离并不是指空间的距离。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is also in a way distant from my own environment, for in my own environment I would have some difficulties in relating information in physically oriented terms. You must understand that by distance I do not refer to space.</details>
你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break.</details>
(9:56。珍的出神状态很深，不过她几乎立刻回来了。在10:22重新开始。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:56. Jane’s trance has been good, but she was out of it almost at once. Resume at 10:22.)</details>
创造与感知之间的密切关系，远超过你们的科学家所体认的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Creation and perception are far more intimately connected than any of your scientists realize.</details>
你们的肉体感官创造了它们所感知的实相，这句话说得很对。对一个细菌、一只鸟、一只昆虫及一个站在树下的人来说，一棵树是非常不同的东西，我不是说树只是看来不同，它的确不同。你透过一套高度专门化的感官来感知它的实相，这并不表示它的实相以更基本的方式存在于你感知的那个形式，而非存在于细菌、昆虫或鸟所感知的形式。除了以你自己的背景之外，你无法以任何其他方式去感知那棵树十分合法的实相，这适用于你所知的物质实相中的任何东西。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is quite true that your physical senses create the reality that they perceive. A tree is something far different to a microbe, a bird, an insect, and a man who stands beneath it. I am not saying that the tree only appears to be different. It is different. You perceive its reality through one set of highly specialized senses. This does not mean that its reality exists in that form in any more basic way than it exists in the form perceived by the microbe, insect, or bird. You cannot perceive the quite valid reality of that tree in any context but your own. This applies to anything within the physical system that you know.</details>
并不是说物质实相是“假”的，而是说，意识以形形色色的装扮来表现它自己，而具体的画面仅只是感知这些装扮的无数种方法之一。肉体感官迫使你将经验转译为物质性的感知，而内在感官却打开了你感知的范围，允许你以自由得多的方式去诠释经验，而创造新的形式和新的通道，经由它，你或任何的意识能认识自己。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It is not that physical reality is false. It is that the physical picture is simply one of an infinite number of ways of perceiving the various guises through which consciousness expresses itself. The physical senses force you to translate experience into physical perceptions. The inner senses open your range of perception, allow you to interpret experience in a far freer manner and to create new forms and new channels through which you, or any consciousness, can know itself.</details>
除了别的之外，意识也是创造力自然自发的运用。你现在是在一个三度空间的脉络内，学习你的情感与心灵生活能创造各种物质形相的方法。你在心灵的环境中操纵，这些操纵而后自动地印在物质的模子上。且说，我们的环境本身具有与你们环境不同方式的创造力。你们的环境是有创造力的，在于树会结果，在于一个自给自足的原则，好比说，大地养活它自己的生物。你们自然的创造面向是人类最深的心灵、精神与物质倾向之具体化，以你们来说这些倾向建立于亘古之前，而且是人类心灵知识库存的一部分。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Consciousness is, among other things, a spontaneous exercise in creativity. You are learning now, in a three-dimensional context, the ways in which your emotional and psychic existence can create varieties of physical form. You manipulate within the psychic environment, and these manipulations are then automatically impressed upon the physical mold. Now our environment is in itself creative in a different manner than yours. Your environment is creative in that trees bear fruit, that there is a self-sustaining principle, that the earth feeds its own, for example. The naturally creative aspects are the materializations of the deepest psychic, spiritual, and physical inclinations of the species, set up in your terms eons ago, and a part of the racial bank of psychic knowledge.</details>
我们赋予我们环境中的元素更大的创造力，那是难以解释的。举例来说，我们没有会生长的花，但我们心理天性中强烈而浓缩的心灵力量会形成新的活动次元。如果你在三度空间的存在中画一副画，那么这画必然是在一个平面上，仅只暗示了你无法插进去的那个完全三度空间的经验。然而，在我们的环境，我们能够创造我们所想要任何空间的效果。这些能力并非我们所独有，而也是你们的遗产。在这本书里，你以后会看到，不是在正常的、清醒的状况下，而是在你其他的意识状态中，你更常在练习运用你自己的内在感官及多次元的能力，比你所知的运用的更频䌓。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We endow the elements of our environment with an even greater creativity that is difficult to explain. We do not have flowers that grow, for example. But the intensity, the condensed psychic strength of our psychological natures forms new dimensions of activity. If you paint a picture within three-dimensional existence, then the painting must be on a flat surface, merely hinting at the complete three-dimensional experience that you cannot insert into it. In our environment, however, we could actually create whatever dimensional effects we desired. All of these abilities are not ours alone. They are your heritage. As you will see later in this book, you exercise your own inner senses, and multidimensional abilities, more frequently than it might seem, in other states of consciousness than the normal, waking one.</details>
既然我自己的环境没有易于界定的物质成分，当我在此书中解释某些相关的主题时，你们将能借推断来了解其本质。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Since my own environment does not have easily defined physical elements, you will be able to understand its nature by inference, as I explain some related topics throughout this book.</details>
由于你自己的心理结构，才使你自己的物质环境在你看来是这个样，如果你主要是靠联想的过程来获得你个人的延续感，而不是靠自身在时间中移动而得的熟悉感，那么你会以完全不同的方式体验物质实相。过去与现在的物体能同时被你看到，它们的出现因联想性的联系而得以合理化。假使你父亲终其一生有八张偏爱的椅子，如果你的感知机构主要是建立于“直觉性联想”，而非建立于“时间顺序”的结果，那么你会在同一刻看到所有这些椅子；或者看到其中一张时，你会知觉到其他的。因此环境本身并非一个独立于外的东西，而是感知模式的结果，这些是由心理的结构所决定的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Your own physical environment appears as it does to you because of your own psychological structure. If you gained your sense of personal continuity through associative processes primarily, rather than as a result of the familiarity of self moving through time, then you would experience physical reality in an entirely different fashion. Objects from past and present could be perceived at once, their presence justified through associative connections. Say that your father throughout his lifetime has eight favorite chairs. If your perceptive mechanisms were primarily set up as a result of intuitive association rather than time sequence, then you would perceive all of these chairs at one time; or seeing one, you would be aware of the others. So environment is not a separate thing in itself, but the result of perceptive patterns, and these are determined by psychological structure.</details>
因此，如果你想知道我的环境是怎样的，你必须先了解我是谁。为了解释，我必须先讲一般性的“意识的本质”。在如此做时，我等于是告诉了你们关于你们自己的许多事。你们本体的内在部分对我将告诉你们的事情已知道很多了。我一部分的目的是，使自我的(egotistical)自己认识你的大部分意识都已熟知的知识，那是长久为你所忽略的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>So if you want to know what my environment is like, you will have to understand what I am. In order to explain, I shall have to speak about the nature of consciousness in general. In doing so I shall end up telling you much about yourself. The inner portions of your identity are already aware of much that I will tell you. Part of my purpose is to acquaint your egotistical self with knowledge that is already known to a larger portion of your own consciousness, that you have long ignored.</details>
你向外看进物质的宇宙，而按照你的“外在感官”所接收到的资料诠释实相。比喻地说，我要站在物质实相内而替你向内看，并且描写那些意识与经验的真相，那是你目前因为太着迷而看不见的。因为你对物质实相着迷，而你们现在是处在与这个我透过她写书的女人同样深的出神状态里。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You look out into the physical universe, and interpret reality according to the information received from your “outer senses.” I will stand, figuratively speaking, in physical reality and look inward for you, and describe those realities of consciousness and experience that you are presently too fascinated to see. For you are fascinated with physical reality, and you are in as deep a trance now as the woman is through whom I write this book.</details>
你们所有的注意力全以高度专门化的方式集中在一个发亮、耀眼的点上，那即你们所谓的实相。在你们周遭有许多其他的实相，但你们忽略它们的存在，抹煞了所有由它们而来的刺激。你们将会发现这种出神状态是有道理的，但你们必须逐渐醒过来。我的目的就在打开你们内在的眼睛。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>All of your attention is focused in a highly specialized way upon one shining, bright point that you call reality. There are other realities all about you, but you ignore their existence, and you blot out all stimuli that come from them. There is a reason for such a trance, as you will discover, but little by little you must wake up. My purpose is to open your inner eyes.</details>
我结束我们的课。我们已接近第二章的结尾。现在祝你们晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>And I end our session. We are close to the end of Chapter Two. Now I wish you good evening.</details>
