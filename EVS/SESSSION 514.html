(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
我们的朋友晚安。你们是来看一个作家工作的，因此，如果你们不反对的话，我们就继续第二章。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Good evening to our friends. You have come to see an author at work, and so we shall continue, if you will bear with us, with Chapter Two.</details>
现在：既然我们体认到我们的身份并不依赖形相，所以，我们自然不怕改变它，而且知道我们能采用任何我们想要的形相。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Since we realize that our identity is not dependent upon form, therefore, of course, we do not fear changing it, knowing that we can adopt any form we desire.</details>
我们并没有你们所谓的死亡。我们的存在带我们到很多其他的环境，而我们也与之打成一片(手势)。我们遵循在这些环境中所存在的法则。我们在这儿的“人”全是教师，因此我们也调整我们的方法，以便对实相具有不同观念的人都能了解它们。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We do not know death in your terms. Our existence takes us into many other environments, and we blend (gesture) into these. We follow what rules of form exist within these environments. All of us here are teachers, and we therefore adapt our methods, also, so that they will make sense to personalities with varying ideas of reality.</details>
意识不依赖形相，如我前面说过的，但它却总在想法创造形相。我们不生存在你们所知的任何时间架构之内。分秒、钟点和年月已失去其意义和魔力。不过，我们对其他系统内的时间状况十分清楚，而在我们的通讯中也必须予以考虑，否则没人会懂我们在说什么。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Consciousness is not dependent upon form, as I have said, and yet it always seeks to create form. We do not exist in any time framework as you know it. Minutes, hours, or years have lost both their meaning and their fascination. We are quite aware of the time situations within other systems, however, and we must take them into account in our communications. Otherwise what we say would not be understood.</details>
并没有真正的界线分隔我所说的这些系统。唯一的分隔是由于“人”在“感知”与“操纵”方面具有不同的能力所引起的。例如，你存在于许多其他的实相系统里，但感知不到它们。甚至当某个事件由这些系统侵入你自己三次元的存在时，你也无法诠释它，因为光是“进入”这个事实就已扭曲了它。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There are no real barriers to separate the systems of which I speak. The only separation is brought about by the varying abilities of personalities to perceive and manipulate. You exist in the midst of many other systems of reality, for example, but you do not perceive them. And even when some event intrudes from these systems into your own three-dimensional existence, you are not able to interpret it, for it is distorted by the very fact of entry.</details>
我告诉你们，我们不感受你们的时间顺序，我们只游历过不同的强度。我们的工作、发展与经验，全发生在我所谓的“片刻点”(moment point)内。此地，在片刻点内，最微细的思想已有了结果，探索过最微不足道的可能性，彻底地检查过所有的可能性，连最弱或最强的感受都照应到了。这很难解释清楚，但片刻点即我们的心理经验在其内发生的那个架构。在其中，同时的行动按照联想的模式彼此“自由”地相随。举例来说，假装我想到了你，约瑟。而当我如此做时，我立刻便完全感受到你的过去、现在与未来〔对你而言〕，以及所有曾支配过你的强烈或决定性的情感与动机。如果我高兴的话，我可以与你一起同游过那些经验。例如，用你们的话来说，在一眨眼的功夫，我们能跟随一个意识，经历它所有的形式。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I told you that we do not experience your time sequence. We travel through various intensities. Our work, development, and experience all takes place within what I term the “moment point.” Here, within the moment point, the smallest thought is brought to fruition, the slightest possibility explored, the Probabilities thoroughly examined, the least or the most forceful feeling entertained. It is difficult to explain this clearly, and yet the moment point is the framework within which we have our psychological experience. Within it, simultaneous actions follow “freely” through associative patterns. For example, pretend that I think of you, Joseph. In so doing I immediately experience ---- and fully ---- your past, present, and future (in your terms), and all of those strong or determining emotions and motivations that have ruled you. I can travel through those experiences with you, if I choose. We can follow a consciousness through all of its forms, for example, and in your terms, within the flicker of an eye.</details>
面对如此经常不断的刺激，一个本体必须学习、发展与体验，才能稳住它自己。我们之中有很多“人”迷失了，甚至忘了自己是谁，直到我们自己再一次的觉醒。现在，对我们而言这多已变成自动的了。在意识无穷尽的变化里，我们仍知觉到存在着的全部“人格银行”的一小部分。我们所谓的“休假”，是去拜访十分简单的生命形态并与之混合。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now it takes study, development, and experience before an identity can learn to hold its own stability in the face of such constant stimuli; and many of us have gotten lost, even forgetting who we were until we once more awakened to ourselves. Much of this is quite automatic to us now. In the infinite varieties of consciousness, we are still aware of a small percentage of the entire banks of personalities that exist. For our “vacations” we visit amid quite simple life forms, and blend with them.</details>
在这个情形下我们沉溺于松弛与睡眠，因为我们能花上一世纪当一棵树，或做为另一实相中的一个不复杂的生命形态。我们以简单的生存之乐来使我们的意识欢喜。你明白，我们可以创造出我们生长于其中的树林。不过，通常我们是非常活跃的，我们的全副精力集中在工作及新的挑战上。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>To this extent we indulge in relaxation and sleep, for we can spend a century as a tree or as an uncomplicated life form in another reality. We delight our consciousness with the enjoyment of simple existence. We may create, you see, the forest in which we grow. Usually however we are highly active, our full energies focused in our work and in new challenges.</details>
我们随时可由我们自己，由我们自己心理的整体(psychological entirety)造出其他的“人”。不过，这些“人”此后必须用他们天赋的创造能力，各凭本事去发展，他们可以自由地走他们自己的路。不过，我们不轻易这样做。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We can form from ourselves, from our own psychological entireties, other personalities whenever we wish. These, however, must then develop according to their own merit, using the creative abilities inherent in them. They are free to go their own way. We do not do this lightly, however.</details>
现在你们可以作第一次的休息，待会儿我们再继续。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take your first break, and we shall continue.</details>
(10:02。珍的出神状态很深。她说她在课前已精疲力竭。整个下午我们都在搬家具。不过，今晚赛斯一旦开始似乎就没问题了；甚至婴儿在吃奶也没关系。10:20以同样快的速度开始。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:02. Jane’s trance had been a deep one. She said she’d been exhausted before the session. We’d spent the afternoon moving furniture. Nothing seemed to bother Seth this evening once he started, however; not even Sean nursing. Resume at the same fast pace at 10:20.)</details>
现在：每位读者都是他自己本体的一部分，并且是正朝着我现在同样的存在状况发展。每个人，在儿时与在梦境里，都多少知觉到属于自己“内在意识”的真正自由。因此，我所说的这些能力是整体意识与每个人本自具足的特性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now: Each reader is a portion of his or her own entity, and is developing toward the same kind of existence that I know. In childhood and in the dream state, each personality is aware to some extent of the true freedom that belongs to its own inner consciousness. These abilities of which I speak, therefore, are inherent characteristics of consciousness as a whole and of each personality.</details>
如我告诉你们的，我的环境不断在变化，但你们自己的也是如此。在这种时候你把十分确实的直觉感知合理化。好比说，如果一个房间对你而言突然显得又小又挤，你会认定这种尺寸的改变是出自想象，房间并没有变，不管你感觉如何。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My environment, as I told you, changes constantly, but then, so does your own. You rationalize away quite legitimate intuitive perception at such times. For example, if a room suddenly appears small and cramped to you, you take it for granted that this change of dimension is imaginative, and that the room has not changed regardless of your feelings.</details>
事实是，在这种情况下，那房间在某些主要的方面曾有相当确实的改变，纵使实际的尺寸仍维持一样。这房间给你的整个心理上的冲击将已改变。而除了你之外，别人也会感觉到它的效果。它会吸引某种事件而非另一种，并且它会改变你自己的心理结构与荷尔蒙产量。你甚至会以十分具体的方式对房间改变了的状况起反应，虽然在尺寸上它的宽或长似乎没有变。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The fact is that the room under such conditions will have changed quite definitely, and in very major respects, even though the physical dimensions will still measure the same. The entire psychological impact of the room will have altered. Its effect will be felt by others beside yourself. It will attract certain kinds of events rather than others, and it will alter your own psychological structure and hormonal output. You will react to the altered state of the room even in quite physical ways, though its width or length, in inches or feet, may not seem to vary.</details>
我告诉我们的好友约瑟在“似乎”这个字下划线，因为你们的工具不会显示实质的改变——既然在这样一个房间内的工具其自身也已经有了同样的改变。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I told our good friend Joseph to underline the word “seem” because your instruments would show no physical alteration ---- since the instruments within such a room would themselves have already altered to the same degree.</details>
你们不断在改变你们的肉体及最密切环境的形相、形状、轮廓与意义，虽然你们尽量忽略这些经常不断的变化。相反的，我们则容许它们有完全的自由，因为我们知道我们被一种“内在的稳定”所推动，它承受得起自发与创造，也了悟到心灵和心理的身份感是依赖着创造性的改变。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You are constantly changing the form, the shape, the contour, and the meaning of your physical body and most intimate environment, although you do your best to ignore these constant alterations. On the other hand, we allow them full rein, knowing that we are motivated by an inner stability that can well afford spontaneity and creation, and realizing that spiritual and psychological identity are dependent upon creative change.</details>
因此我们的环境是由精致的不平衡构成的，并容许“改变”尽情地活动。你自己的时间结构使你误以为物质有相当的永恒性，因而你对其中经常的变化视而不见。你的肉体感官尽可能地限制你只感知一个高度形式化的实相。通常，只有经由直觉的应用，以及在睡梦中，你才能觉察，你自己的或任何别的意识本质上是在快乐地变化的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Our environment therefore is composed of exquisite imbalances, where change is allowed full play. Your own time structure misleads you into your ideas of the relative permanency of physical matter, and you close your eyes to the constant alterations within it. Your physical senses confine you as best they can to the perception of a highly formalized reality. Only through the use of the intuitions and in sleep and dream states, as a rule, can you perceive the joyfully changing nature of your own, and any, consciousness.</details>
我的责任之一就是要在这种事情上开导你们。我们必须用那些你们至少相当熟悉的概念。在这样做时，我们因而利用我们自己的那些人格中，你们能与之建立某种程度关系的那个部分。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>One of my duties is to enlighten you on such matter. We must use concepts that are at least fairly familiar to you. In doing so, we therefore use portions of our own personalities, with whom you can to some extent relate.</details>
我们的环境没有止境。以你们的话来说，不会缺乏可在其中运作的空间或时间。现在，对没有合适的背景与发展的任何意识而言，这都会给他极大的压力。我们没有一个简单、安适的宇宙可躲藏在内。我们对在我们所知的意识之外缘闪现的其他相当陌生的实相系统仍然保持警觉。各种不同的意识种类之多，远超过物质形相，而每一种意识皆有它自己的知觉模式，居住在它自己的伪装系统里。但是所有这些意识内心都认识，存在于所有伪装之下，并且组成任何实相的实相，不论这“实相”叫做什么。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>There is no end to our environment. In your terms there would be no lack of space or time in which to operate. Now this would put tremendous pressure on any consciousness without proper background and development. We do not have one simple, cozy universe in which to hide. We are still alert to other quite alien systems of reality that flash on the very outskirts of consciousness as we know it. There are far more various kinds of consciousness than there are physical forms, each with its own patterns of perception, dwelling within its own camouflage system. Yet all of these have inner knowledge of the reality that exists within all camouflage and that composes any reality, by whatever name it is called.</details>
现在你们可以休息。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now you may take your break.</details>
(10:44—10:56。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:44 to 10:56.)</details>
现在，在梦境，许多这种自由对你们而言都相当地自然，你们常为练习应用这种潜能而形成梦中环境。以后，我至少会谈到一些如何认识你们自己那些心灵技艺的方法，将它们与你们在日常物质生活中的熟练相比较。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now, many of these freedoms are quite natural to you in the dream state, and you form dream environments often to exercise such potentials. Later I will have at least some remarks to make concerning the ways that you can learn to recognize your own feats, to compare them with your proficiency in daily physical life.</details>
因此，由学着改变及操纵你的梦中环境，你能学着改变你的物质环境。你也能建议特定的梦，在其中看到一个你所想要的改变，而在某种条件下，这些改变随即会出现在你的物质实相中。现在你常在不知不觉中做这事。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You can learn to change your physical environment, therefore, by learning to change and manipulate your dream environment. You can also suggest specific dreams in which a desired change is seen, and under certain conditions these will then appear in your physical reality. Now often you do this without realizing it.</details>
整体意识采取各种形式，它却并不需要总是在一个形式之内。并非所有的形式都是具体的。因此，有些“人格”从未有过身体。他们沿着不同的方向进化，而他们的心理结构也与你们的迥异。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Whole consciousness adopts various forms. It need not always be within a form. All forms are not physical ones. Some personalities, therefore, have never been physical. They have evolved along different lines, and their psychological structures would be alien to your own.</details>
某种程度来说我也曾旅游过这种环境。可是，意识必须显示自己，它不能不存在(unbe)。它是非实质的，因此它必须以别的方式显示它“活起来了”。例如在某些系统，它形成高度整合的数学与音乐的模式，它们本身又成为对其他宇宙系统的刺激。不过，我对这些并不十分认识，不能很熟稔地谈它们。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>To some extent I also travel through such environments. Consciousness must show itself, however. It cannot unbe. It is not physical, it must therefore show its activation in other ways. In some systems for example, it forms highly integrated mathematical and musical patterns that are themselves stimuli for other universal systems. I am not very well acquainted with these, however, and cannot speak of them with any great familiarity.</details>
如果我的环境不是个永久的结构，那么就如我曾告诉你们的，你们自己的环境也不是。如果我知道我现在是经由鲁柏在通讯，那么以不同的方式，你们每个人也在与其他的人格，或透过其他的人格以心电感应沟通，虽然你们对你们的成就少有所知。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>If my environment is not a permanently structured one, then as I have told you, neither is your own. If I am aware of communicating now through Ruburt, in different ways each of you telepathically communicates to and through other personalities, though with little knowledge of your accomplishment.</details>
现在我要结束这一节。我想为我们这儿的小朋友(西恩·华京斯又在吃奶)唱支催眠曲——这不是为本书的。但我唱不成调。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now I will end our session. I would sing a lullaby ---- this is not for the book ---- for our small friend here (Sean Watkins, who was nursing again). But I am not in voice for it.</details>
我衷心祝福你们全体。晚安。(开玩笑地强调：)这份稿子的确是最初的初稿，也是最后的完稿。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My heartiest wishes to you all. A fond good evening. (Amused and emphatic): And this is indeed [a] first and final draft.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。谢谢你，很有意思。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good night, Seth. Thank you ---- it’s been very interesting.”</details>
(11:08。赛斯的临别赠言是回答今晚早先苏的一个问题：他的书需要修改几次？到目前为止，珍的意见是此书不需要任何修改，除了重新安排偶尔有的一个不很顺的片语之外。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(11:08 P.M. Seth’s parting remark was in answer to a question Sue had raised earlier in the evening, about how much revision his book would require. Jane’s opinion, so far, was that the book wouldn’t need any work except for the rearranging of an occasional awkward phrase, etc.)</details>
