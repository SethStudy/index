<a id=1 href=1>第577节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>MARCH 31, 1971, 9:13 P.M. WEDNESDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年3月31日 星期三 晚上9：13</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(This afternoon Jane held her first creative writing class.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(今天下午珍开始她第一节的创作课。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now, good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will begin dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们开始口述。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Any one of these various layers of consciousness can be used as the normal acting consciousness, reality being viewed from that specific standpoint.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这些意识种种层面中的任何一个，都能作为正常的代理意识，而由那特定立足点来看实相。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Physical reality is therefore glimpsed by other kinds of personalities in other systems, from their own unique viewpoint. Peering at it from this angle, so to speak, you would not recognize it as your own home system. From some of these viewpoints, your physical matter has little or no permanency, while to others your own thoughts have a shape and form, perceived by observers but not by yourselves.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>因此，在其他系统里的其他类“人格”，以他们自己独特的观点也瞥见物质实相。可以说，由这角度窥视它，你不会认出它是你自己的老家系统。从某些这一类观点看去，你们的物质很少甚至没有永恒性，而同时在另一些不是你们自己的其他观察者眼中，你们自己的思想却是有形有象的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In traveling through the states of consciousness, these other personalities would try to attain some focus and perceive your environment, trying to make sense of data with which they are largely unacquainted. Since many of them are unaware of your idea of time, they would find it difficult to understand that you perceive events with intervals between, and would not perceive the inner organization that you thrust upon your normal environment. Yours is obviously a probable system to other fields also touched by the field of Probabilities.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在旅游过自己的各种状态时，这些其他人格会尝试获得一些焦点而感知到你的环境，试着使他们大体上不熟悉的资料显得有些道理。既然他们中有许多人对你们的时间概念并无所知，他们会发现很难了解当你们看事件时，在事件与事件之间是看到时间间隔的，他们也不会感知到你加于正常环境上的“内在组织”。对其他那些也触及可能性的地区而言，你们的系统显然是个可能的系统。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:20.) As these systems are adjacent to yours, so is yours adjacent; Alternate focusallows personalities from other realities to perceive your own, then, as it can theoretically at least allow you a glimpse into their existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:20)即因这些其他系统与你的邻接，因此你的与他们的也是邻接的；那么交替的焦点容许其他实相的“人格”感知到你自己的实相，就如至少理论上说的，交替的焦点也容许你一瞥他们的存在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>End of chapter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>此章结束。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>And now I have an assignment for you, and the opportunity to participate in my book. You may take the rest of the session to make up an excellent ---- underlined twice (humorously), list of questions that will appear in the next, question-and-answer chapter.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在我给你一项作业，并且也给你一个参与我的书的机会，你可以用此节剩下的时间来做一个极佳的——划两道线(幽默地)——问题清单，在下一章中提出来。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>If you have questions already given by others, by all means include these. But they should be questions from you rather than questions posed by me. They will be more pertinent to the reader.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>如果你已有人们想问的一些问题，当然一定要把它们包括进去。但这些问题，应该是你们想问的而非我提出的问题。这样它们对读者才会比较切题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Then present these to me at our next session, or one at a time, or two, as you prefer, and I will answer them. You may organize the questions under headings, but you need not do so. If several happen to fall under one large subject heading, this would simply be a convenient way of handling it.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>然后在下一节把这些问题给我，随你喜欢一次提出一个或两个，我会回答。你可以把问题按标题分组，但不必一定如此。如果好几个问题恰属一个大主题之下，这就会是个挺方便的处理方法。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Can Ruburt ask questions too?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“鲁柏可以问问题吗？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may both make up the list. You need not have the whole list by the next session. One answer may take some time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你俩可一同开单子。你不一定得在下一节就列好全部的单子。一个答复可能会费好些时间。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“That’s what I was wondering about.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“那正是我在想该怎么办的事。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I suggest, then, that you both get to work.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>那么，我建议你俩开始工作。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The telephone began to ring while I was writing. Jane was still in trance but didn’t appear to be bothered. Feeling some irritation, I let it ring until it stopped.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在我写字时电话开始响。珍仍在出神状态但似没被打扰。我觉得有些不耐，让它响到停止。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I will be around to inspire you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我就在这儿不走，来给你们一点灵感。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30 P.M. This had been the shortest session in several years. I was still surprised at the quick ending; I didn’t even say good night to Seth. Already I was wondering whether we should ask questions we thought others were interested in, or just those we spontaneously came up with ourselves.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30。这是几年来最短的一节。我还在惊奇于这么快的结束；我甚至没跟赛斯道晚安。我已开始在想，是否该问我们认为别人会感兴趣的问题，或只是我们自己自动自发想起的问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane checked the outline Seth had given us for his book in the 510th session for January 19, 1970. Sure enough, he had listed a question-and-answer chapter. I had forgotten this. For some reason I felt uneasy now; perhaps I thought it might not be a good idea to interrupt the flow of the book in such a manner.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍查了在1971年1月19第510节里，赛斯为此书给我们的大纲，他果真曾列出这一章。我已忘了。不知为了什么原因我现在感到不安；也许我认为以这种方式干扰此书的流畅不是个好主意。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane hasn’t read any of Seth’s book since the 521st session, in Chapter Four; in spite of temptations, she has always felt it better to be free of concern about it. We didn’t think her not looking at it would interfere with her having questions. She has of course had contacts with the book, aside from her own imperfect memory. I gave her a couple of short passages to read to her ESP class. She discussed the book to some extent with Patty Middleton recently; and I’ve talked about it at times, although without referring back to the typed page.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍自第四章第521节后没读过赛斯的书；尽管受到诱惑，她总觉得不去担心它比较好。我们不认为她没看它会妨碍她提出问题。除了她自己对本书口述内容不完美的记忆之外，当然她还曾接触过它。我给过她两小段念给她的ESP班听。最近她与派蒂·密豆顿讨论了一下这本书；而有时我也谈到过它，虽然并没参考已打好字的资料。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Within an hour after the session ended, we had fifteen questions listed. We’ll write a longer list for the session on Monday, April 5.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在课结束的一小时内，我们已列出了十五个问题。我们还要为4月5日星期一的课开列一张更长的单子。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>CHAPTER 20 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</a>
