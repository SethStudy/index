<a id=1 href=1>第536节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>JUNE 22, 1970, 9:18 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1970年6月22日 星期一 晚上9：18</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will continue dictation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：我们再继续口述。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Your consciousness, as you think of it, may of course leave your body entirely before physical death. (As mentioned earlier, there is no precise point of death, but I am speaking as if there is for the sake of your convenience.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你所谓的意识当然可以在肉体死亡前完全离开你的身体。(如先前说过，没有一个精确的死亡点，但为了你的方便，我当它是有来说。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Your conscious self ---- You may take a break and tend to your chores….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你的有意识的自己——你可以休息一下，管你的家务……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Already I was putting my notebook aside. Our black cat, Rooney, was scratching at the door of our living room. Jane sat waiting half in trance ---- a feeling she later described as “weird” ---- while I followed the cat down the hall. Before I got back inside the apartment our paperboy arrived; by the time I finished paying him Jane was out of trance. Resume finally at 9:27.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我已然把笔记本放在一边。我们的黑猫隆尼，正在抓客厅的门。珍在半出神状态——一种后来她形容为“古怪的”感觉——坐着等我，同时我跟着那猫走出门厅。在我回到公寓内之前，我们的报童来了；等我付完了报费，珍已离开了出神状态。最后在9:27继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: Your consciousness leaves the physical organism in various ways, according to the conditions. In some cases the organism itself is still able to function to some degree, although without the leadership or organization that existed previously. The simple consciousness of atoms, cells, and organs continues to exist, after the main consciousness has left, for some time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>按照当时的情况，你的意识以不同的方式离开肉体机制。在有些情形，虽然没有先前存在的领导或组织。有机体自身仍能作用到某个程度。在主要意识离去之后，原子、分子和组织的简单意识仍继续存在一阵子。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There may or may not be disorientation on your part, according to your beliefs and development. Now I do not necessarily mean intellectual development. The intellect should go hand in hand with the emotions and intuitions, but if it pulls against these too strongly, difficulties can arise when the newly freed consciousness seizes upon its ideas about reality after death, rather than facing the particular reality in which it finds itself. It can deny feeling, in other words, and even attempt to argue itself out of its present independence from the body.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>依照你的信念和发展，在你这方面也许有也许没有迷失感。现在我不一定是指理性的发展。理性应与情感和直觉携手同行，但如果理性太强烈地与情感和直觉作对，那么当新近得到自由的意识抓住理性对死后实相的概念，而不去面对它发现自己在其中的那个特定实相时，便可能有困难发生。换言之，意识能否认感觉，甚至试图强辩，以否定自己目前独立于肉体的情形。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:32.) Again, as mentioned earlier, an individual can be so certain that death is the end of all, that oblivion, though temporary, results. In many cases, immediately on leaving the body there is, of course, amazement and a recognition of the situation. The body itself may be viewed, for example, and many funerals have a guest of honor amidst the company ---- and no one gazes into the face of the corpse with as much curiosity and wonder.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:32)再说一次，如前面提过的，一个人能如此确信死亡是一切的终了，以致导致了什么都不记得的“空白”——虽然只是暂时的。在许多例子，当意识离开了身体之后，它当然立刻会有惊异感及对情况的一个认识。例如，它也许可以看到尸体本身，许多葬礼都有一个贵宾夹在人群中——没有人怀着跟它一样大的好奇和惊异注视尸体的脸。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>At this point many variations in behavior emerge, each the result of individual background, knowledge, and habit. The surroundings in which the dead find themselves will often vary. Vivid hallucinations may form experience quite as real as any in mortal life. Now, I have told you that thoughts and feelings form physical reality, and they form after-death experience. This does not mean that the experiences are not valid, any more than it means that physical life is not valid.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在这时，许多不同的行为出现了，每一种皆是个人背景、知识与习惯的结果。死者发现它自己所处的环境常常是因人而异的。栩栩如生的幻相可以形成与任何活着时同样真实的经验。我告诉过你思想与情感形成物质实相，而它们也形成死后经验。这并不表示那经验是无效的，正如它也不表示肉体生命是无效的一样。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Certain images have been used to symbolize such a transition from one existence to another, and many of these are extremely valuable in that they provide a framework with understandable references. The crossing of the River Styx is such a one. The dying expected certain procedures to occur in a more or less orderly fashion. The maps were known beforehand. At death, the consciousness hallucinated the river vividly. Relatives and friends already dead entered into the ritual, which was a profound ceremony also on their parts. The river was as real as any that you know, as treacherous to a traveler alone without proper knowledge. Guides were always at the river to help such travelers across.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>某些形象曾被用来象征由一个存在到另一存在的这种过渡，这些象征里面有许多是极为宝贵的，就在于它们用人们能懂的说法提供了一个架构。渡过冥河是其中之一。濒死者期待多少以规律方式发生的某种程序，他事先已知道了地图。在死时，意识栩栩如生地幻想出那条河，已死的亲友也进入了这仪式，对他们来说也是个奥妙的典礼。这条河与你所知的任何一条河一样的真，对一个“不谙水性”的孤单旅人也是同样的诡诈。向导永远会在河边协助这种旅人过渡。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It does not do to say that such a river is illusion . The symbol is reality, you see. The way was planned. Now, that particular map is no longer generally in use. The living do not know how to read it. Christianity has believed in a heaven and a hell, a purgatory, and reckoning; and so, at death, to those who so believe in these symbols, another ceremony is enacted, and the guides take on the guises of those beloved figures of Christian saints and heroes.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>说这样的一条河是幻相是没有意义的。你要明白，象征即实相，路是计划好的。现在，那特定的地图一般已不再通用了。活着的人不知如何解读它。基督教曾相信天堂和地狱、炼狱及最后审判日；因而，在死时，对那些如此相信这些象征的人，便演出了另一个典礼，而向导们就扮成那些死者所钟爱的基督教圣人与英雄的模样。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:48.) Then with this as framework, and in terms that they can understand, such individuals are told the true situation. Mass religious movements have for centuries fulfilled that purpose, in giving man some plan to be followed. It little mattered that later the plan was seen as a child’s primer, a book of instructions complete with colorful tales, for the main purpose was served and there was little disorientation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:48暂停。)然后以这为架构，以他们所能了解的说法，死者被告以真实的情况。世代以来群众性的宗教运动给了人一些可遵循的计划，而满足了那个目的。至于后来那计划看来像是儿童的初级读本——一本有精彩故事的教科书——也没什么关系，因为主要的目的已达成，死者没有什么迷失感。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In periods where no such mass ideas are held, there is more disorientation, and when life after death is completely denied, the problem is somewhat magnified. Many, of course, are overjoyed to find themselves still conscious. Others have to learn all over again about certain laws of behavior, for they do not realize the creative potency of their thoughts or emotions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在那些没有持有此种群众概念的时期，就有更多的迷失感，而当死后生命完全被否认时，问题就不免放大了。当然，许多死者发现他们仍有意识时是乐极了。而其他人则必须从头学某些行为准则，因为他们不知自己思想或情感的创造潜力。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Such an individual may find himself in ten different environments within the flicker of an eyelash, for example, with no idea of the reason behind the situation. He will see no continuity at all, and feel himself flung without rhyme or reason from one experience to another, never realizing that his own thoughts are propelling him quite literally.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>举例来说，这种人可能发现自己一眨眼间在十个不同的环境里，而完全不明白其背后的理由。他看不出任何连续性，而感觉自己毫无节奏或理由地被从一个经验抛到另一个经验，永没领悟真的是自己的思想在推动他。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:55.) I am speaking now of the events immediately following death, for there are other stages. Guides will helpfully become a part of your hallucinations, in order to help you out of them, but they must first of all get your trust.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:55)我现在正在说的是死后即刻发生的事，因为还有其他的阶段。向导们为了帮助你离开幻相，乃变为幻相的一部分以便于你有助，但他们首先必须取得你的信任。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>At one time ---- in your terms ---- I myself acted as such a guide; as in a sleep state Ruburt now follows the same road. The situation is rather tricky from the guide’s viewpoint, for psychologically utmost discretion must be used. One man’s Moses, as I discovered, may not be another man’s Moses. I have served as a rather creditable Moses on several occasions ---- and once, though this is hard to believe, to an Arab.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我一度——以你们的话来说——也扮演过这样一个向导；就和鲁柏现在在睡眠状态走的路子一样。由向导的角度来看，情况是相当难处理的，因为心理上必须极为小心谨慎。如我所发现的，一个人的摩西也许不是另一个人的摩西。有几回我曾扮过一个相当可信的摩西——而有一次，虽然说来令人难以置信，我还是对一个阿拉伯人扮的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:00.) The Arab was a very interesting character, by the way, and to illustrate some of the difficulties involved, I will tell you about him. He Hated the Jews, but somehow he was obsessed with the idea that Moses was more powerful than Allah, and for years this was the secret sin upon his conscience. He spent some time in Constantinople at the time of the Crusades. He was captured, and ended up with a group of Turks, all to be executed by the Christians, in this case very horribly so. They forced his mouth open and stuffed it with burning coals, as a starter. He cried to Allah, and then in greater desperation to Moses, and as his consciousness left his body, Moses was there.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:00)顺便说，这阿拉伯人是个非常有趣的角色，为了说明所涉及的一些困难，我来告诉你他的故事。他恨犹太人，但不知怎的，他执迷于摩西要比阿拉有威力得多的念头，多年来这是他良心上的秘密罪恶。在十字军东征时他在君士坦丁堡待过一阵子。他被捕了，结果与一群土耳其人在一块儿，全都要被基督徒处死，在这个例子是很恐怖地处死。一开始，他们强迫他张开口，把烧着的炭塞进去，他向安拉哭叫，然后在更绝望中向摩西哭叫，而当他的意识离开他的身体时，摩西就在那里。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>He believed in Moses more than he did Allah, and I did not know until the last moment which form I was to assume. He was a very likable chap, and under the circumstances I did not mind when he seemed to expect a battle for his soul. Moses and Allah were to fight for him. He could not rid himself of the idea of force, though he had died by force, and nothing could persuade him to accept any kind of peace or contentment, or any rest, until some kind of battle was wrought.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他相信摩西甚于相信阿拉，而我直到最后一刻才知我应僭用哪个形象。他是个很讨喜的家伙，在当时的情况下，我不介意他似乎期待为了争取他的灵魂将会有一战。摩西和安拉是该为他一战的。虽然他死于武力，他还未能摆脱尚武的观念，他无论如何都不能接受任何一种的和平或满足或任何的休息，直到打完某种仗为止。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>A friend and I, with some others, staged the ceremony, and from opposite clouds in the sky Allah and I shouted out our claims upon his soul ---- while he, poor man, cowered on the ground between us. Now while I tell this story humorously, you must understand that the man’s belief brought it about, and so to set him free, we worked it through.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我和一个朋友还有一些其他的人上演了这场好戏，安拉和我由天上相对的云堆中叫嚣，各自宣称对他的灵魂有所有权——而他，可怜的人，吓得在我们之间匍匐于地。现在我虽幽默地讲这个故事，你们必须了解是那个人的信念使它发生的，因此我们慢慢的做好它来放他自由。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I called upon Jehovah, but to no avail, because our Arab did not know of Jehovah ---- only of Moses ---- and it was in Moses he put his faith. Allah drew a cosmic sword and I set it afire so that he dropped it. It fell to the ground and set the land aflame. Our Arab cried out again. He saw leagues of followers behind Allah, and so leagues of followers appeared behind me. Our friend was convinced that one of the three of us must be destroyed, and he feared mightily that he would be the victim.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我召唤耶和华，但是没有用，因为我们的阿拉伯老兄不知耶和华——只知摩西——而他的信心是在摩西身上。安拉拔出一把宇宙之剑，我使它着火，他便丢下了剑，剑掉在地上使大地也着了火，我们的阿拉伯老兄又哭叫起来。他看见安拉身后的盟友，因而在我身后也出现了盟友。我们的朋友相信我们三人中必有一人被摧毁，他极怕自己会是那个受害者。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Finally the opposing clouds in which we appeared came closer. In my hand I held a tablet that said: “Thou shalt not kill.” Allah held a sword. As we came closer we exchanged these items, and our followers merged. We came together, forming the image of a s-u-n (spelled out), and we said: “We are one.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>最后我们由其中出现的两个云堆彼此移近了。我手中拿着一块石版，上面写：“你不可杀人。”安拉拿着一把剑。当我们更靠近时我们交换了这些东西，而我们的随从也打成一片了。我们合在一起，形成一个太阳的形象，然后说道：“我们是一体的”。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The two diametrically opposed ideas had to merge or the man would have had no peace, and only when these opposites were united could we begin to explain his situation.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这两个完全相反的概念必须合而为一，否则那人心中永远不能平安，只有当这相反两方统一起来，我们才能开始向他解释他的处境。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:20. Jane’s trance had been deep, although she recalled parts of Seth’s adventure. She said she had a series of images which paralleled the material, yet she couldn’t describe them now.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:20。珍的出神状态很深，虽然她想得起部分的赛斯历险记。她说，当赛斯说故事的时候，她有一系列与资料并行的影像，现在她却无法形容它们。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The Crusades consisted of a series of military expeditions sent out by the Christian powers in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, to recover the Holy Land from the Moslems. While Seth was giving the data, Jane said, she wondered what an Arab would be doing in Turkish Constantinople in those days. I explained the geography of the region. Presumably, such a traveler could have reached Constantinople [now Istanbul], by an overland journey across Turkey, which lay north of the Arab lands, or by sailing the eastern Mediterranean around Turkey, through the Dardanelles and so into the city. Distances in the Middle East are comparatively short.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(十字军包括在11、12及13世纪由基督教强国派出的一系列远征军，以从回教徒手中收回圣地。珍说在赛斯给那资料时，她奇怪一个阿拉伯人在当时土耳其属的君士坦丁堡做什么。我跟她解释那个地区的地理，土耳其位于阿拉伯土地之北，可以假定这样一个旅人能由陆路经土耳其抵达君士坦丁堡〔现在的伊斯坦丁堡〕，或乘帆船由东地中海绕过土耳其，经达达尼尔海峡而进入此城。在中东距离是比较短的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Jane literally has no sense of geography or of distance, facts that have unwittingly worked to her advantage in sessions. On the other hand, she has an unerring sense of direction in local surroundings, and can indicate the points of the compass far better than I can. Resume at 10:43.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(珍实在是没有地理或距离观念，这个事实无意中在课里反倒对她有利。另一方面来说，在本地环境中，她有一种不会错的方向感，能由罗盘指出方向，这可比我行多了。在10:43继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: To be such a guide requires great discipline and training.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在：做这样一个向导需要极大的修炼。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Before the event just mentioned, for example, I had spent many lifetimes acting as a guide under the tutorship of another in my daily sleep states.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如，在我刚才说的事件之前，我已经花了许多世在我每日的睡梦中，在另一个向导的教导下学做向导。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>It is possible for example to lose yourself momentarily in the hallucinations that are being formed, and in such cases another teacher must bail you out. Delicate probing of the psychological processes is necessary, and the variety of hallucinations in which you may become involved is endless. You may, for example, take the form of an individual’s dearly beloved dead pet.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>举例言之，我可能会在所形成的幻觉中暂时迷失了自己，在这种情形下，另一个老师必须把你救出来。对心理过程的灵巧小心探索是必须的，而你可能卷入的形形色色幻觉是无穷尽的。例如，你可能扮作死者非常眷爱的已死宠物。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>All of these hallucinatory activities take place usually some short time immediately following death. Some individuals are fully aware of their circumstances, however, because of previous training and development, and they are ready after a rest, if they desire to progress to other stages.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>所有这些幻觉活动通常是发生在紧接着死亡后的很短时间内。不过有些人因为先前的训练和发展，而完全知觉他们的情况，而等他们休息了一会儿之后，如果他们想要的话，便已准备好进步到其他的阶段了。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>They may, for example, become aware of their own reincarnational selves, recognizing quite readily personalities they knew in other lives, if those personalities are not otherwise engaged. They may deliberately now hallucinate, or they may “relive” certain portions of past lives if they choose. Then there is a period of self-examination, a rendering of accounts, so to speak, in which they are able to view their entire performance, their abilities and weak points and to decide whether or not they will return to physical existence.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>例如，他们也许会觉察那些转世的自己，十分轻易地认出他们在别的人生中认识的人，如果那些人还没再转世的话。他们现在可以故意制造幻觉，或他们可能“重度”前生的某些部分，如果他们如此选择的话。然后有一段“自我检讨”的时期，可说是提出一个结账报告，因而他们可以看看自己整个的表演、能力和弱点，再决定要不要回到物质实相去。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:55.) Any given individual may experience any of these stages, you see; except for the self-examination, many may be sidestepped entirely. Since the emotions are so important, it is of great benefit if friends are waiting for you. In many instances, however, these friends have progressed to other stages of activity, and often a guide will take the guise of a friend for a while, so that you will feel more confident.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:55)你要明白，任何一个人可能经历这些阶段中的任何一个；除了“自我检讨”之外，其中许多阶段可以完全闪避掉。既然情感是如此重要，如果有朋友在等着你是极有利的。可是在许多例子里，这些朋友已进到其他的活动阶段去了，而常常会有一个向导暂时假扮某个朋友，以使你觉得更有信心。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Of course, it is only because most people believe that you cannot leave your body that you do not consciously have out-of-body experiences with any frequency, generally speaking, in your lifetimes. Such experiences would acquaint you far better than words with some understanding of the conditions that will be encountered.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>当然，只是因为大多数人相信你不能离开自己的身体，所以在你的一生里，才不常有意识地“出体”。这种经验远比文字能使你对将要遭遇的情况有些了解。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Remember that in one way, your physical existence is the result of mass hallucination. Vast gulfs exist between one man’s reality and another’s. After death, experience has as much organization, highly intricate and involved, as you know now. You have your private hallucinations now, only you do not realize what they are. Such hallucinations as I have been speaking of, intense symbolistic encounters, can also occur in your sleep states, when the personality is at a time of great change, or when opposing ideas must be unified, or if one must give way to another. These are highly charged, significant psychological and psychic events, whether they happen before or after death.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你要记住，在某一方面，你们的肉体生活是群体幻觉(mass hallucination)的结果。一个人与另一个人的实相间存有广大的鸿沟。死后的经验有与你现在所知生活同样多的组织，非常的繁复。你现在就有你私人的幻相，只是你没有领悟到它们是什么而已。当人格正在剧变时，或是当相反的概念必须统合时，或者其中的一个概念必须对另一个让步时，如我刚才说到的那种具强烈象征性的接触，也可能在你的睡眠状态里发生。这些是非常刺激的、重要的心理与心灵事件，不管它们是在死前或死后发生。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:05.) Occurring in the dream state, they can change the course of a civilization. After death, an individual may visualize his (immediately previous physical) life as an animal with which he must come to terms, and such a battle or encounter has far-reaching consequences, for the man must come to terms with all portions of himself. In this case, whether the hallucination ends with him riding the animal, making friends with it, domesticating it, killing it or being killed by it, each alternative… (Jane coughed, then paused and took a sip of beer) is carefully weighed, and the results will have much to do with his future development.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(11:05)这些事件在梦中发生时，往往能改变一个文明的方向。在死后，一个人可能把他的(前生的物质)生命视为一个他必须与之达成协议的动物，而这样一场战斗或接触有长远的后果，因为人必须与自己所有部分达成协议。在这情形，不管这幻觉以他骑着这动物、与它做朋友、驯养它、杀死它或被它所杀作结尾，每一个可行的选择……(珍咳嗽起来，然后停下来，喝了一口啤酒。)都被小心地权衡，而其结果与他将来的发展大有关系。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You had better take a break for Ruburt’s sake.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>为了鲁柏之故，你最好休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“All right.” Jane’s voice was now quite hoarse and weak; I believe she would have been forced to stop in a few more moments. This is one of the very few times, in seven years of sessions, that she has had any voice interference.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好吧。”珍的嗓音现在相当粗哑而微弱；我相信在几分钟之内她就会被迫停止。在七年的课里，珍极少有任何声音上的干扰，这是几次中的一次。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(At 11:11 I read the last two paragraphs of the material to her, but she couldn’t make any emotional connections that might explain the voice difficulty, nor could I. Jane is inordinately fond of animals. Perhaps Seth’s example had caused the reaction, I thought, but she didn’t seem to respond here either. Resume at 11:20, in a voice stronger but rougher than usual.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在11:11，我念资料最后的两段给她听，但她或我都无法看出这与她的嗓音问题有任何情绪上的关联。珍格外喜爱动物。也许赛斯的例子引起这反应，我想，但她此处似乎也不表同意。以比平时更大但较粗的声音在11:20继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: We will shortly end the session.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们不久就会结束这一节。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>This “life-symbolization” may be adopted by those who gave little thought to self-examination during their lifetime. It is a part of the self-examination process, therefore, in which an individual forms his life into an image and then deals with it. Such a method is not used by all. Sometimes a series of such episodes are necessary….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这“生活象征化”(life-symbolization)可能被那些在他们活着时很少想到反省的人所采用。因之，它是自我检讨过程的一部分，在其中一个人把他的生活做成一个形象，然后处理它。但并非每个人都用这方法。有时一连串这种插曲是必要的……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>That is the end of dictation, and my heartiest regards to you both, and to the beloved monster beside you.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>听写到此结束，给你俩以及你们身边的可爱怪物我最衷心的祝福。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good night, Seth, and thank you.” Our cat, Willy, lay snoozing beside me on the couch. 11:25 P.M. Jane soon recovered her usual voice.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“晚安赛斯，谢谢你。”我们的猫威立，在我旁边的沙发上打盹。11:25。珍很快地恢复了她平常的嗓音。)</a>
