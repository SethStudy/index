<a id=1 href=1>SESSION 582,</a>
<a id=1 href=1>第582节</a>
<a id=1 href=1>APRIL 19, 1971, 9:20 P.M. MONDAY</a>
<a id=1 href=1>1971年4月19日 星期一 晚上9：20</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Before the session we read over a letter Jane had received on March 16, 1971, from Mrs. R. Her son had disappeared on June 28, 1970. Jane had written her on April 4, promising some information soon.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在课前，我们把一封珍在1971年3月16日由R太太处收到的信看完。她的儿子于1970年6月28日失踪了。珍在4月4日写信给她，答应很快就给她一些消息。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Good evening.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>晚安。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“赛斯晚安。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now. Begin with your program. What do you have for me first?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>现在。开始你的节目，首先你为我准备了什么？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“How about answering the letter from Mrs. R. first?” As Seth, Jane reached out for the letter.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“可否先答复R太太的信？”身为赛斯，珍伸手来拿信。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Hand it to me. Now. Give us a moment.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>把信递给我。现在，请等我们一会儿。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Eyes closed, Jane leaned back in her rocker with the folded letter in her right hand.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(眼睛闭着，珍往后靠在摇椅里，折起来的信在她右手里。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The boy has been in several locations, with one stop, a brief one, in a hospital. He seemed to have some difficulty with a lung, or his lungs. I believe he visited Detroit. (Pause.) Also the state of Florida, near a small town beginning with a P, but a long enough name.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这男孩到过好几个地点，在医院有一个短短的停留。他的肺似乎有问题。我相信他去过底特律，(停顿。)也去过佛罗里达州，靠近一个以P开头但名字很长的小城。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>California was in his mind strongly, also. Thirty-six. (Pause.) He had one job, in what seems to be a factory location, in a rather dark environment, with rows of what I assume to be machinery and large windows, treated so that the sunlight did not shine through brightly.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>他心里也非常想念加州。三十六。(停顿。)他有个工作，似乎是在个工厂的地方，在一个相当暗的环境，有一列列我假定是机器的东西，还有处理过的大窗户以使阳光不会很亮地照进去。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Either this or the place was half below ground level. The name “George” connected with him. A friend perhaps. Also he sent a telegram I believe, either to someone, or he will send one to his mother.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>或是这样或是那地方一半在地面以下。“乔治”之名与他有关。也许是个朋友。我相信他还发了个电报，或是给某人，或他将发电报给他母亲。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There is a connection with two young women. (Long pause.) The mother will hear from him, however. That is all I have for now.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>与两个年轻女人有关联。(停顿很久。)不过，做母亲的会听到他的消息，那就是我到目前所知的一切。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(The above data was delivered at a crisp pace. We have no way of knowing how long Seth’s reply to a query like Mrs. R’s will be. Whatever the length ---- one, five, or ten pages ---- we send a copy of it to the writer as soon as I get the session typed up. We ask for a reply, to see if it’s possible to check the material. In this case, we didn’t hear from Mrs. R.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(以上资料以很爽朗的步调传述了。我们无从知道对像R太太这种问题，赛斯的答复会有多长。不论是什么长度——一、五或十页——我们在我把此节打好字后立刻送一份副本给写信的人。我们要求一封回信，来看是否可能核对这资料。在这案例里，我们没听到R太太的消息。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will try to give an explanation of your question concerning the nature of evolution.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>对你们关于“进化的本质”的问题，我们将试着给一个解释。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Number twenty-seven: Is evolution, as it is commonly thought of, a fact or something greatly distorted</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(第二十七：一般所认为的“进化”是一件事实或是非常被扭曲了的事？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Apropos of this question, in ESP class eight days later Seth had this to say about Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution:</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(关于这个问题，在八天后的ESP班，赛斯对达尔文及其进化论说了以下这些话：</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“He spent his last years proving it, and yet it has no real validity. It has a validity within very limited perspectives only; for consciousness does, indeed, evolve form. Form does not evolve consciousness. All consciousness does, indeed, exist at once, and therefore it did not evolve in those terms. It is according to when you come into the picture, and what you choose to observe, and what part of the play you decide to observe. It is more the other way around, in that evolved consciousness forms itself into many different patterns and rains down on reality. Consciousness did not come from atoms and molecules scattered by chance through the universe, or scattered by chance through many universes. Consciousness did not arrive because inert matter suddenly soared into activity and song. The consciousness existed first, and evolved the form into which it then began to manifest itself.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“他把余年花在想证明‘进化论’上，但它却没有真正的确实性。它只在一个非常狭窄的观点里有确实性；因为意识的确使形体进化(evolve)，而形体并不使意识进化。所有的意识的确同时存在，因此它不是像那样进化发展的。‘进化论’是按照你何时进入这画面，以及你选择要观察什么，以及你决定要观察哪部分的戏剧而立论。其实，反面才比较对，就是说已进化的意识把它自己化入许多不同的模式，而如雨般降落到实相里。意识并不是来自偶然地被散布到全宇宙或散布到许多宇宙的原子与分子。意识的到来并不是因为无生命的物质突然跃升成活动与歌曲而‘载欣载奔’起来。意识首先存在，而进化出形体，然后再由其中开始显示它自己。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Now, if you had all been really paying attention to what I have been saying for some time about the simultaneous nature of time and existence, then you would have known that the theory of evolution is as beautiful a tale as the theory of biblical creation. Both are quite handy, and both are methods of telling stories, and both might seem to agree within their own systems, and yet, in larger respects they cannot be realities…. No ---- no form of matter, however potent, will be self-evolved into consciousness, no matter what other bits of matter are added to it. Without the consciousness, the matter would not be there in the universe, floating around, waiting for another component to give it reality, consciousness, existence, or song.”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“其实，如果你们全都对我一再说的‘时间与存在的同时性’真的付出注意力的话，那么你们该已知道，‘进化论’就与圣经的〈创世纪〉一样是个美丽的故事。两者都相当方便，两者都是说故事的方法，而两者在它们自己的系统内也似言之成理。但是，在较大的方面来看它们不可能是实相……不——任何形式的‘物质’。不论它多强而有力，都不可能自我进化成为‘意识’，不论再加进去其他什么物质也无用。没有‘意识’，则不会有‘物质’在宇宙里四处浮游，等着另一个成分来给它实相、意识、存在或生命之歌。”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(A class member: “Every bit of matter already has consciousness?”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(班上一位同学：“每一小点物质都已有了意识吗？”</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Indeed, and the consciousness came first. You are quite correct. I thank you for bringing up the matter. [Smile.] There are many ways of bringing up matter.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“的确，而且意识在先。你是相当对的。我谢谢你提出这个问题(matter)。〔微笑：〕有许多提出问题(bringing up matter)的方式。〔译注：问题与物质为双关语。〕)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30.) At the risk of really repeating myself, let me state that time as you know it does not exist basically and that all creations are simultaneous. (Amused.) That should answer your question.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:30)冒着一再重复自己的危险，让我声明基本上如你们所知的时间并不存在，而所有的创造是同时的。(好笑地：)那应回答了你的问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“I’ve already thought of that,” I said. As I told Jane at our first break, the knowledge that time is actually simultaneous is sometimes confounding when one asks certain types of questions; this knowledge half answers the question, yet we want the rest of the question considered.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我说：“我早已想到了那个。”如我在第一次休息时告诉珍的，关于“时间事实上是同时的”这知识，当人问某一类问题时会令人混淆；这知识已回答了一半的问题，但我们要这问题的余下一半也被考虑。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will elaborate.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们将详尽地说明。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“All right.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“好吧。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>All of the ages of Earth, in your terms both past and present, exist, as do future ages. Now. You may make that a capital now. Some life forms are being developed in what you think of as present time. They will not appear physically until you reach your future time. Do you follow me?</a>
<a id=1 href=1>地球上的所有年代，在你们来说“过去的”与“现在的”两者都存在，“将来的”年代也一样的存在。“现在”，你可以把它写成大写的现在，在你想来是“现在”的时间，有些生命形式正在发展中，但他们不会实体地出现，直到你们到达了你们的“将来”。你了解吗？</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Yes.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“了解”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>They exist now, however, as certainly as do, say, the dinosaurs. You only choose to focus your attention upon a highly specific field of space-time coordinates, accepting these as present reality, and closing yourselves off from all others. Specifically, complicated physical forms are not the result of previous simpler ones. They all exist in larger terms at once.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>可是，他们现在存在，就与恐龙现在存在一样的肯定。你只选择把你的注意力集中于一个极为特定的时、空座标场所，接受它们为“现在的实相”，而把你们自己关闭在所有其他实相之外。我特别要指明，复杂的生命形态并非先前较简单的形态之结果。广义来说，它们全部同时存在。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>On the other hand, more complicated organizations of consciousness are necessary to form, enter, and vitalize the more complicated physical structures. All structure is formed by consciousness. Defined in your terms, a fragment is a consciousness not as developed as your own. The living portions of nature are the result of your own creativity, projections and fragments of your own energy; energy that comes to you from All That Is and goes outward from you, forming its own image manifestations as you form yours.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>在另一方面来说，必须要比较复杂的“意识组织”，才能形成、进入比较复杂的“物质结构”而赋之以生命。所有结构皆由意识形成。以你们的说法来定义，一个片段体是一个不如你们自己那么发展的意识。自然界有生命的部分都是你们自己创造力的结果，是你们自己能量的投射和片段；是从“一切万有”到你这儿而又由你这儿出去的能量，像你形成自己的形象一样，它也形成自己的形象。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Pause at 9:42.) Since you do not perceive the future and do not understand that life goes out in all directions, then it seems only logical to suppose that present forms must be based upon past ones. You do close your eyes to evidence that does not support this theory. (Heartily, smiling): And of course I am not speaking of you personally, Joseph.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在9:42停顿。)既然你不觉知未来，也不了解生命向所有的方向散布，那么你必会假设现在的形式一定是建基于过去的形式。你们对那些不支持这学说的证据真是置之不理。(微笑，诚恳地：)自然我不只是指你个人而言，约瑟。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>There is no single-line development, in other words. The fragment elements directed outward by you as a species also add of course to your physical reality, for without the fine balance maintained, and without this cooperation, your particular kind of environment would not be possible.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>换言之，没有所谓单线的发展。被作为一个物类的你们，投向外的片段成分当然也增益了你的物质实相，因为，若没维持这么好的平衡，若没这合作，你们这种特定的环境是不可能存在的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>I have told you often that you do yourselves a grave injustice by limiting your conception of the self. Your sense of identity, freedom, power, and love would be immeasurably enhanced if you could understand that what you are does not end at the boundaries of your skin, but continues outward through the physical environment that seems to be impersonal, or not-self.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我常常告诉你们，你们对“自己”的观念那么局促，实在是太对不起自己。你们的身份感、自由、权力与爱会不可限量地加强，如果你们能了解，“你们是什么”(what you are)并不是以你们皮肤为界，却是继续向外，一直到那似乎不具人性或异己(not-self)的物质环境。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Biologically it should be easy to understand that you are physically a part of earth and everything within it. You are made of the same elements, you breathe the same air. You cannot hold the air that you take within you and then say, “This is myself, filled with this air. I will not let it go,” or you would find out very quickly that you were not nearly so independent.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>由生物学上你很容易了解，以肉体而言，你是地球与其中每样东西的一部分。你们由同样的元素造成，你们呼吸同样的空气。你不能留住你吸进的空气，而后说：“这是我自己，充满了这空气，我不要让它走。”不然你会很快的发现，你其实并没那么独立。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You are biologically connected, chemically connected with the earth that you know; but since it is also formed naturally and spontaneously from your own projected psychic energy, since you and the seasons even have a psychic interaction, then the self must be understood in a far greater context. Such a context would allow you to share in life experiences of many other forms, to follow patterns of energy and emotion of which you barely conceive, and to sense a world-consciousness in which you have your own independent part.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你与你所知的地球在生物学与化学上是相连的；但既然它也是由你自己投射出的心灵能量自然而然形成的，既然你甚至与四季都有种心灵的交互作用，那么这“自己”必得在一个远为广大的范畴被了解。这样一个范畴会让你分享许多其他形态的生活经验，去追随你只微微理解的能量与情感模式，去感受一个世界意识(world-consciousness)，在其中你有自己独立的部分。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You may take your break.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你可以休息一下。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:54. I told Jane that she had delivered this excellent answer to my question at a considerably faster pace. Resume at 10:04.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(9:54。我告诉珍，她以一种快得相当多的步调传述了对我的问题的这个极佳答复。在10:04继续。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now: I finished with the last question, so continue.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我答完了上个问题，所以继续吧。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Number twenty-eight: Have I painted any portraits of Speakers?”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“第二十八：我画过任何‘说法者’的像吗？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>You have indeed. One was a painting purchased by Carl and Sue Watkins· (which, half jokingly, we had called Moses); one, the portrait of me (pause); and one that you have not completed ---- that the Dean (Seth’s friendly title for Tom M., one of the members of ESP class) asked about recently, of a woman. And your blue man. (Pause.) That is your answer.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>你的确画过。一是卡尔与苏·华京斯买去的一幅画(我们曾半开玩笑地叫它“摩西”)；一张是我的画像(停顿)；一张是你尚未画完的——即教务长(赛斯对Tom.M.，ESP班的一个成员的友善称呼)最近问到过的一个女人的画像。以及你的蓝色男人(停顿)。那即是给你的答复。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(In Chapter Seventeen Seth told Jane and me that we’d both been Speakers. Since I haven’t painted any self-portraits I wouldn’t have been included in the list anyhow, but Seth did neglect to mention my painting of Jane. I didn’t catch the omission, so I didn’t ask about it….</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在第十七章赛斯告诉过珍和我，我们俩都曾是“说法者”，既然我没画过任何自画像，我无论如何是不会被包括在这名单里的，但赛斯的确忘了提及我替珍画的像。我没抓住这省略，因此我也没问这事……</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(When Seth tells me I’ve done a Speaker’s portrait, I translate this to mean that I’ve tuned-in on but one personality out of the very many making up that Speaker’s entity.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(当赛斯告诉我，我画了一张“说法者”的像时，我将之诠释为在组成那位“说法者”存有的许多个人格里，我对其中之一对准了频率。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(After the sessions began I started a series of portraits of people I don’t “know” consciously. At first I understood little about the possible sources for their inspiration; I simply put my urge to paint them to work. ideas for the portraits “come” to me spontaneously when I am mentally occupied with something else. I am always surprised. Sometimes I see an outright vision, objectified quite clearly and in full color. The vision is either of the finished painting, or of the individual who is to be portrayed. On several occasions I have “known” the subject was dead. Few of the paintings are of Speakers, obviously, and in no case did I realize I was working with such a personality.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在赛斯课开始后，我开始了一系列的人像画，而在意识的层面我并不“认识”这些人。最先我不大了解画他们的灵感由何而来；我只把想画他们的冲动付诸行动。当我脑子里想着别的事的时候，对这些画像的念头便自发地“来”到，我总是感到很惊奇。有时我就真看见一幅幻景，十分清楚地在我面前而且是综艺十彩的。这幻景呈现的或者是已完成的的画，或是那个要被我画的人。有几回我“明知”那主角已死。显然，画像中“说法者”的像不多，而且我也没有一次悟到我是在画这样一个人。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(I recently finished the blue man that Seth refers to. I painted a male in modern garb, but in reality, according to an amused Seth, the subject was a female clairvoyant who lived in Constantinople in the fourteenth century; unconscious distortions in my own perceptions led me to the male figure. Seth has given her the name Ianodiala. The oil is very successful, and is done in blue and green.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(我最近画完了赛斯提到的蓝色男人。我画了一个现代衣着的男人，但事实上，赛斯很乐的告诉我，主角是个女性的“千里眼”，在14世纪住在君士坦丁堡，我自己知觉在无意识上的扭曲使得我画了个男人身形。赛斯给了她Ianodiala的名字。这幅油画画得很成功，是以蓝色与绿色画成的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Such sources of inspirational material were entirely unsuspected by me in earlier years. I believe now that they are among those usually present at unconscious levels; but in order to expand the potentials for the creative act as much as possible, I would like to see others learn to cultivate such visions and perceptions on a deliberate, conscious basis. It seems to me the benefits would be many. There is much to be learned here.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(在早年我全没猜疑到灵感资料会有这种来源。现在我相信它们是时常存在于无意识层面之中的那些东西之一；但为了要把创造行为的潜能扩展到极致，我很想见到别人学会在一个故意的、有意识的基础上培养这种幻相与感知。在我看来这会有很多好处，在这方面有许多可学的。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Do you want to deal now with the question about the Dead Sea Scrolls and Yahoshua?” This was in reference to a letter Jane had received on April 12, having to do with Seth’s third-Christ data in The Seth Material.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“你现在要不要交待有关‘死海经卷’(Dead Sea Scrolls)与耶和华的问题？”这是关于一封珍在4月12日收到的信：与《灵界的讯息》里的赛斯的第三位基督资料有关。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>We will save that for our religious chapter. In it we will answer your other related questions.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>我们把它留到我们谈宗教的那一章来讲，在其中我们会回答你们其他相关的问题。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Number fifty-two: In the 429th session for August 14, 1968, you said: ‘Also, minutes and hours have their own consciousness.’ You didn’t elaborate.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“第五十二：在1968年8月14日的第491节，你说：‘分钟与小时也有它们自己的意识。’你没有详细解释。”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(Smile.) And now you want me to elaborate.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(微笑：)而现在你要我详加解释。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“Well, I don’t know. I’m wondering if perhaps the question is too complicated for a quick answer.”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(“嗯，我也不知道。我在猜想是否这个问题太复杂了，你无法给我们一个简洁的回答？”)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Give us a moment. (Pause.) What you perceive of time is a portion of other events intruding into your own system, often interpreted as movement in space, or as something that separates events ---- if not in space, then in a way impossible to define without using the concept of time.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>请等我们一会儿。(停顿。)你们所感知的“时间”，是侵入你们自己系统的其他事件的一部分，常被诠释为“在空间里的移动”，或为“分隔事件的东西”——如果不在空间里，那么不用时间的观念就不可能加以定义。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>What separates events is not time, but your perception. You perceive events “one at a time.” Time as it appears to you is, instead, a psychic organization of experience. The seeming beginning and end of an event; the seeming birth and death, are simply other dimensions of experience as, for example, height, width, weight. Instead it seems to you that you grow toward an end, when an end is a part of a particular experience, or if you prefer, person-event.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>其实分隔事件的不是“时间”，却是你们的“感知力”。你们“一次一件”地感知事件。相反的，你所看到的“时间”是经验的一种心灵组织(psychic organization)。一件事看起来的“开头”与“结尾”；看起来的“诞生”与“死亡”，只是“经验”的其他次元，就如高度、宽度、重量。相反的，当一个“终点”是一个特殊经验——或若你喜欢宁称之为“人—事”(person-event)——的一部分时，看起来你彷佛在朝着那个“终点”生长。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:26.) We are speaking then of multidimensional reality. The whole self or entity or soul can never be completely materialized in three-dimensional form. A part of it can be projected into that dimension however, extending so many years in time, taking up so much space, and so forth.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:26)那么我们在谈的是多次元的实相。全我或存有或灵魂永不能以三次元的形式完全地具体化，但它的一部分却能被投射入那个次元，在时间上伸展到这么多年，占据了这么多空间等等。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>The entity sees the whole event, the whole person-event, with the time element, or age in your terms, as simply another characteristic or dimension. The person-event is not cut off, however. Its greater reality simply cannot appear within three dimensions. It is instead composed of atoms and molecules that you do not perceive, both above and below the physical range of intensities ---- and all of these in their own way possess consciousness.</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这“存有”把这整个事件，这整个的“人—事”与其时间因素，或你们所谓的“年纪”只看作另一个特性或次元。不过，这“人—事”并没被切断，只是它的更大实相不能在三次元内展现而已。反之，它是由你感知不到的、在物质的强度范围之上或之下的原子与分子所组成——而所有这些以它们自己的方式都拥有意识。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>In greater terms, seconds and moments do not exist, either, but the reality that is behind time or that you perceive as time, the “outside time” events, are composed of units that also have their own kind of consciousness. They form what appears as time to you, as atoms and molecules form what appears as space to you. (Pause.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>以更广义的说法，分与秒也并不存在，但在时间或你视为的时间之背后的那个实相，那“在时间外的”(outside time)事件是由那些也有某种它们自己意识的“单位”所组成。它们形成你们看来似为“时间”的东西，就如原子和分子形成你们看来是“空间”的东西。(停顿。)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>Now these are units moving faster than the speed of light, excellent energy sources intruding into and impinging upon matter without ever materializing. They will be interpreted differently in other systems. That is the end. (Smiling.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>这些是动得比光速还要快的“单位”，侵入、侵犯到物质却从未具体化的极佳能源。它们在其他的系统会受到不同的诠释。到此结束了(微笑)。</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:35. Of book dictation, that is. This was actually a break. Seth finished the session with several pages of material dealing with other matter. End at 11:16 P.M.)</a>
<a id=1 href=1>(10:35。那只是书的口述结束。这实际上是一次休息。赛斯以有关其他事情的几页资料作结。在11:16结束。)</a>
