晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Good evening.</details>
(“赛斯晚安。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good evening, Seth.”)</details>
且说你们对空间(space)的概念是大谬不然的。在我与你们的活动范围接触时，我并不像某种精神超人，飞过金光灿烂的天空而进入你们的物质领域。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now your ideas of space are highly erroneous. So in my contacts with your sphere of activity, I do not sweep through bright golden skies like some spiritual superman into your physical domain.</details>
在以后的章节中我会再谈这点，但说真格的，你们所感知的空间根本不存在。对空间的错觉不但是由你们自己的肉体感知机构所引起，而且是由你们所接受的心理模式——在你们的系统内，意识“进化”到某一阶段时所采纳的模式——所引起。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I will go into this in a later chapter, but in a very real manner, space as you perceive it simply does not exist. Not only is the illusion  of space caused by your own physical perceptive mechanisms, but it is also caused bymental patterns that you have accepted ---- patterns that are adopted by consciousness when it reaches a certain stage of “evolution” within your system.</details>
(9:16。和上节一样，我将不时指出时间，以显示赛斯传递资料的速度。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:16. As in last session, I will indicate the time periodically to show the rate at which Seth delivers material.)</details>
当你到达或出现于肉身生活时，你的心智非但不是等着经验在上面大书特书的一张白纸，而且你已装备有远超过任何电脑的记忆库。你以已经具备的技巧与能力面对在这星球上的第一天，虽然它们可用可不用；而且它们不仅是你所认为遗传的结果。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>When you arrive, or emerge, into physical life, not only is your mind not a blank slate, waiting for the scrolls that experience will write upon it, but you are already equipped with a memory bank far surpassing that of any computer. You face your first day upon the planet with skills and abilities already built in, though they may or may not be used; and they are not merely the result of heredity as you think of it.</details>
虽只作为一个暂时的比喻，你可以将你的灵魂或存有想成有意识且活生生的、受神感召的电脑，它设计自身的存在及生生世世的生活程式。但这电脑赋有如此高的创造力，它所设计的每个不同人格都跃入意识及生命，又从而创造了也许电脑本身从未梦想到的实相。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may think of your soul or entity ---- though only briefly and for the sake of this analogy ---- as some conscious and living, divinely inspired computer who programs its own existences and lifetimes. But this computer is so highly endowed with creativity that each of the various personalities it programs spring into consciousness and song, and in turn create realities that may have been undreamed of by the computer itself.</details>
(9:25。)但是，每一个这种人格对它将在其中运作的实相都带有预先建立的概念，它心理上的配备是特为适合这种非常专门化的环境而量身定做的。它有充分的自由，但必须在它被设定“生存脉络”中运作。可是，整体大电脑内的浓缩知识，却藏在人格最秘密的隐敝处。我必须强调，我并不是说灵魂或存有是一部电脑，只是请你由这种方式来看看这事，以便弄清楚几点。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:25.) Each such personality, however, comes with a built-in idea of the reality in which it will operate, and itsmental equipment is highly tailored to meet very specialized environments. It has full freedom, but it must operate within the context of existence to which it has been programmed. Within the personality, however, in the most secret recesses, is the condensed knowledge that resides in the computer as a whole. I must emphasize that I am not saying that the soul or entity is a computer, but only asking you to look at the matter in this light in order to make several points clear.</details>
每个人格不但天生具有在它的环境中——以你们来说就是在物质实相中——获得新的生存方式的能力，而且能创造性地增益自己意识的那种品质，而在如此做时就穿透了这专门化的系统，突破了它所知实相的障碍。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Each personality has within it the ability not only to gain a new type of existence in the environment ---- in your case in physical reality ---- but to add creatively to the very quality of its own consciousness, and in so doing to work its way through the specialized system, breaking the barriers of reality as it knows it.</details>
(9:30。)且说，所有这些都有其目的，以后也将会讨论。但是我在此提及这整个主题，乃是因为我要你们明白，你们的环境并不如你们所想象的那么“真”。那么，当你出生时，你已“被制约”(conditioned)以某个特定的方式去知觉实相，并且在一个很有限却非常强烈的(intense)范围内来诠释经验。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:30.) Now, there is a purpose in all this that will also be discussed later. I mention this whole subject here, however, because I want you to see that your environment is not real in the terms that you imagine it to be. When you are born, then, you are already “conditioned” to perceive reality in a particular manner, and to interpret experience in a very limited but intense range.</details>
在能清楚地给你们关于我的环境，或我在其中运作的那些其他实相系统的一个概念之前，我必须解释此点。举例来说，在你们和我的环境之间，并没有空间、没有实质的界限分隔我们。老实说，你们透过肉体感官或科学仪器所见，或由演绎得来对实相的概念，与事实很少有相似处——而这些事实是很难解释的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I must explain this before I can clearly give you an idea of my environment, or of those other systems of reality in which I operate. There is no space between my environment and yours, for example, no physical boundaries that separate us. In a very real way of speaking, your concept of reality as seen through your physical senses, scientific instruments, or arrived at through deduction, bears little resemblance to the facts ---- and the facts are difficult to explain.</details>
(9:34。)赛斯—珍为了强调而向前倾，还打着手势，眼睛黑而大睁。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:34. Seth-Jane leaned forward for emphasis, gesturing, eyes dark and wide.)</details>
你们的行星系统同时存在于时间与空间里。你们经肉眼或仪器所感知的宇宙，看似由距你们远近不等的银河、恒星及行星组成。然而，基本上，这是一个幻相。你们的感官和你做为物质性生物的存在本身都设计好让你如此感知宇宙。你所知的宇宙，是当事件侵入你的三度空间实相时，你对它的诠释。那些事件是精神性的。这并不意味，好比说，你不能旅行到在那物质宇宙里的其他行星去，就像它不意指你不能用桌子来摆书、眼镜或橘子(如我们的咖啡桌上现有的)，虽然桌子本身并没有固态的特性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Your planetary systems exist at once, simultaneously, both in time and in space. The universe that you seem to perceive, either visually or through instruments, appears to be composed of galaxies, stars, and planets, at various distances from you. Basically, however, this is an illusion . Your senses and your very existence as physical creatures program you to perceive the universe in such a way. The universe as you know it is your interpretation of events as they intrude upon your three-dimensional reality. The events are mental. This does not mean that you cannot travel to other planets, for example, within that physical universe, any more than it means that you cannot use tables to hold books, glasses, and oranges (as our coffee table did at that moment), although the table has no solid qualities of its own.</details>
(9:42。在一个快速的开始后，现在珍的速度慢下来不少。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:42. Jane’s pace was now slowing considerably after a fast start.)</details>
当我进入你们的系统，我由一连串心理与心灵的事件中经过。你们会将这些事件“诠释”为空间与时间，而我时常也需用这些术语，因为我必须用你们的而非我自己的语言。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>When I enter your system, I move through a series of mental and psychic events. You would interpret these events as space and time, and so often I must use the terms, for I must use your language rather than my own.</details>
基本假设(root assumptions)是我所说的那些对实相的预设观念——你们在这些协议上建立生存的概念。举例来说，空间与时间就是基本假设。每一个实相系统有其自己的这样一套协议。当我在你们的系统内通讯的时候，我必须应用和了解这系统所根据的基本假设。做为一个老师，去了解与应用这些是我的工作，而我曾在许多这种系统中生存过，做为我“基本训练”的一部分；虽然你们可能那样称呼它，我的同事和我却给它不同的名字。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Root assumptions are those built-in ideas of reality of which I spoke ---- those agreements upon which you base your ideas of existence. Space and time, for example, are root assumptions. Each system of reality has its own set of such agreements. When I communicate within your system, I must use and understand the root assumptions upon which it is based. As a teacher it is part of my job to understand and use these, and I have had existences in many such systems as a part of what you may call my basic training; though in your terms my associates and I had other names for them.</details>
你可以休息一下。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break.</details>
(9:52。珍几乎立即脱离回过神来，“我觉得好像那个电视秀上的一个人。”她说，指今晚我们刚才看到的一个受欢迎的科幻节目。她试着形容在赛斯开始讲话前的一刹那，她的一个意象，又说实在无法诉诸语言：“我看见……一大片像星星的东西。我们将一个概念对着它投射出去，因之它仿佛要爆开来了。但概念其实就在这里。”她说，向她放在下巴下方合成杯状的双手点点头。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(9:52. Jane was out of trance almost immediately. “I feel like someone on that TV show,” she said, referring to a popular science fiction program we’d seen earlier this evening. She tried to describe an image she’d had just before Seth began speaking, while saying it couldn’t really be put into words: “I saw… a field of something like stars. An idea would be projected out there by us against this field so that it seemed to explode. Yet really the idea’s right here,” she said, nodding toward her cupped hands, which she held just below her chin.</details>
(在休息时珍由赛斯处得到一个虽短而清楚的信息：我们应当把我们的床转回向北，而不是现在这样朝西。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(During break Jane got a brief but clear message from Seth: We should turn our bed back so that its head pointed north again, instead of to the west as it does now.</details>
(在10:02重新以较慢的步调开始。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Resume at a slow pace at 10:02.)</details>
存有或灵魂的本质，具有远比你们的宗教所赋予它多得多的创造性和复杂性。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>The entity, or the soul, has a far more creative and complicated nature than even your religions have ever granted it.</details>
灵魂运用无数的感知方法，并且还拥有许多其他类的意识听其指挥。你们对灵魂的概念真的是受了你们三度空间观念的限制。灵魂能够改变其意识的焦点，它用意识就好像你用你头上的眼睛。现在在我的存在层面，我就是知道“我并非我的意识”这个事实。虽然这个事实好像很奇怪。我的意识是我可用的一项属性，这点适用于本书的每一位读者，纵使你们可能不知道这件事。那么灵魂或存有是比意识要多的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>It utilizes numberless methods of perception, and it has at its command many other kinds of consciousness. Your idea of the soul is indeed limited by your three-dimensional concepts. The soul can change the focus of its consciousness, and uses consciousness as you use the eyes in your head. Now in my level of existence I am simply aware of the fact, strange as it may seem, that I am not my consciousness. My consciousness is an attribute to be used by me. This applies to each of the readers of this book, even though the knowledge may be hidden. soul or entity, then, is more than consciousness.</details>
因此，当我进入你们的环境时，我将我的意识转到你们的方向。在某一方面说，我把我是什么(what I am)转译为你们多少能了解的事件。以一个远较狭隘的方式，任何一个艺术家，当他将他是什么，或其一部分转译为一张画时，也在做同样的事。这里，至少有一个发人深省的比喻。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>When I enter your environment, I turn my consciousness in your direction, therefore. In one way, I translate what I am into an event that you can understand to some extent. In a much more limited manner, any artist does the same thing when he translates what he is, or a portion of it, into a painting. There is at least an evocative analogy there.</details>
当我进入你们的系统时，我侵入三度空间的实相，而你必须根据你们自己的基本假设来诠释所发生之事。现在不论你们知觉与否，你们每个人在梦境也都侵入其他的实相系统，而你们正常有意识的自身并没完全参与。在主观经验中，你将物质性存在留在后面，而有时候在梦中你怀着强烈的目的与有效的创造力(creative validity)来行动，虽然在你醒来那一刹那，就遗忘了那梦。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>When I enter your system, I intrude into three-dimensional reality, and you must interpret what happens in the light of your own root assumptions. Now whether or not you realize it, each of you intrudes into other systems of reality in your dream states without the full participation of your normally conscious self. In subjective experience you leave behind physical existence and act, at times, with strong purpose and creative validity within dreams that you forget the instant you awaken.</details>
当你想到你存在的目的时，你是以日常清醒时的生活来想的，但在这些其他的梦的次元里，你也在为你的目的工作，而那时，你与自己存有的其他部分在沟通，努力做一些与你在醒时所做的一样有意义的工作。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>When you think of the purpose of your existence, you think in terms of daily waking life, but you also work at your purpose in these other dream dimensions, and you are then in communication with other portions of your own entity, at work at endeavors quite as valid as those you are about in waking life.</details>
(10:17。)因此，当我与你的实相接触时，就好像是我进入了你的一个梦里，当我经由珍·罗伯兹来口述这书的时候，我是知觉我自己的，却也知觉在我自己环境里的我；因为我只送了我自己的一部分到此，就如在你写信给一个朋友时，也许送出了你一部分的意识，却仍知觉到你坐在里面的房间一样。当我口述时，我意识的一部分当下是在这出神的女士之内，所以我比你在信中送出的多得多，但这比喻是够接近的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:17.) When I contact your reality, therefore, it is as if I were entering one of your dreams. I can be aware of myself as I dictate this book through Jane Roberts., and yet also be aware of myself in my own environment; for I send only a portion of myself here, as you perhaps send out a portion of your consciousness as you write a letter to a friend, and yet are aware of the room in which you sit. I send out much more than you do in a letter, for a portion of my consciousness is now within the entranced woman as I dictate, but the analogy is close enough.</details>
如我先前提到过的，我的环境不是一个你们所谓刚死的人所在的环境，但以后我会描写在那种情况下你会碰到什么情形。你们与我的环境一个很大的不同，在于你必须把精神活动具体化为物质。我们却了解精神活动的实相，体认它们灿烂的确实性。我们接受它们的本来面目，因此我们不再需要先将它们具体化，再以如此僵化的方式来诠释它们。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My environment, as I mentioned earlier, is not one of a personality recently dead in your terms, but later I will describe what you can expect under those conditions. One large difference between your environment and mine is that you must physically materializemental acts as physical matter. We understand the reality of mental acts and recognize their brilliant validity. We accept them for what they are, and therefore we are beyond the necessity to materialize them and interpret them in such a rigid manner.</details>
我以前很钟爱你们的地球。现在我能把我意识的焦点对着它，而如果我愿意的话，也能像你们一样地亲身经历它；但我也能以许多方式去感知它，那是你们在这辈子办不到的。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Your earth was very dear to me. I can now turn the focus of my consciousness toward it, and if I choose, experience it as you do; but I can also perceive it in many ways that you cannot in your time.</details>
且说，有些读者将立刻直观性地领悟我在说什么，因为你们早已怀疑，你们是透过虽然色彩丰富却极度扭曲的虚幻镜头来看经验。也请别忘了，如果广义地说物质实相是个幻相的话，它是个由更大的实相所引起的幻相。这幻相自身有其目的和意义。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now some of you who read this book will immediately and intuitively grasp what I am saying, for you will have already suspected that you are viewing experience through highly distorted, though colorful, figurative lenses. Remember also that if physical reality is in a larger sense an illusion , it is an illusion  caused by a greater reality. The illusion  itself has a purpose and a meaning.</details>
你可以休息。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You may take your break.</details>
(10:31。珍又很快地回过神来，不过她记不起任何的资料。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(10:31. Jane was again out of trance very quickly, yet she couldn’t remember any of the material.</details>
(并不一定想今晚就得到回答，我问了一个珍如果为此书写序时也许会想到的问题：她能不能在一个月内每晚为赛斯口述而完成此书，或她需要某种分量的日常生活经验，也许要经过好几个月，才能让书传过来？<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Without necessarily expecting an answer this evening, I asked a question I thought Jane might want to consider if and when she wrote an introduction for this book: Could she dictate the whole book for Seth in, say, a month’s worth of daily sessions, or did she need a certain amount of day-by-day living and experience, over a period of months, perhaps, in order to be able to let the book come through?</details>
(在10:40以同样缓慢的步调继续。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Resume at the same slow pace at 10:45.)</details>
也许这样说要好些：物质的实相是实相所采取的一种形式。不过，在你们的系统，你们把焦点非常强烈地对准在经验的一个相当小的面向上。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Perhaps it is better to say that physical reality is one form that reality takes. In your system, however, you are focused much more intensely upon one relatively small aspect of experience.</details>
我们能自由地旅游过数目不等的这种实相，而我们目前的经验包括了在这每个实相中所做的工作，我无意贬低你们现在的人格或肉体存在的重要性。刚好相反。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>We can travel freely through varying numbers of such realities. Our experience at this point includes our work in each. I do not mean to minimize the importance of your present personalities, nor of physical existence. To the contrary.</details>
三度空间的经验是个无价的训练场所。你现在所认识的这个人格连同它的记忆，的确会长存，但它只是你全部本体的一部分，就像你这一生的童年是你目前人格极为重要的一部分，虽然你现在早超过一个小孩很多了。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Three-dimensional experience is an invaluable place of training. Your personality as you now know it will indeed persevere, and with its memories, but it is only a part of your entire identity, even as your childhood in this life is an extremely important part of your present personality, though now you are far more than a child.</details>
你将继续成长发展，也将渐渐觉知其他的环境，正如当你离开了你童年的家时一样。但环境并非客观之物，独立存在于你之外的物体的聚合。相反的，你们造成环境，而它们相当实在的就是你们自己的延伸；由你们的意识延伸向外的心理活动化为具体。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>You will continue to grow and develop, and you will become aware of other environments, even as you left your childhood home. But environments are not objective things, conglomerations of objects that exist independently of you. Instead you form them and they are quite literally extensions of yourself; materializedmental acts that extend outward from your consciousness.</details>
我会告诉你，你究竟如何地造成你的环境。我按照同样的法则造成我自己的，虽然你结果造成实质物体而我却不然。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I will tell you exactly how you form your environment. I form mine following the same rules, though you end up with physical objects and I do not.</details>
我等下一节再就这一点继续写书。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>Now I will begin, there, on our book at our next session.</details>
(“好的。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“All right.”)</details>
(10:56暂停。)现在回答你的问题：这书可以每夜接着写，或以我们现在的方法也行。总是留有一些余地给自发性及意外之事，因此你们经验中的任何事都可以拿来做例子，或做个引子，导出一个我本就有意的讨论。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Pause at 10:56.) To your question: The book could be written on consecutive evenings, as well as with our present method. A certain leeway is always left for spontaneity and surprises, so that anything in your experience can be used as an example or as a point about which I can build a discussion that I had already intended in any case.</details>
我只是建议鲁柏试试把床移位一星期，再看他以为如何。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>I suggest, merely, that Ruburt try the bed arrangement for a week, and then see what he thinks.</details>
(“好吧。”我们的睡房很小，不容易把床放成南北向；此外，那样珍就不能由唯一的窗子看出去了。我们并没照赛斯的建议把床转向。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Okay.” Our bedroom is small and it’s difficult to have the bed lined up north-south; besides, Jane can’t see out the single window then. We didn’t turn the bed as Seth suggested.)</details>
我衷心祝福你俩，晚安。<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>My heartiest wishes to you both, and a fond good evening.</details>
(“晚安，赛斯，谢谢你。”)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(“Good night, Seth. Thank you.”</details>
(11:00，“我有怪怪的感觉，”当珍回过神时说，“我觉得似乎自赛斯开始口述此书以来并没多少时间过去。但主观地我却觉得到此为止书里已有一大堆的资料了——可以说我是在表达一种累积的或丰富的经验。也许我在找某种疯狂的措辞，像‘浓缩的丰富’……”<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(11:00 P.M. “I have funny feelings,” Jane said when she was out of trance. “I feel as though not much time has really passed since Seth started the book. But subjectively I think there’s a vast amount of information in it so far ---- that somehow I’m expressing an accumulated amount, or a richness, of experience. Maybe I’m looking for some crazy expression like condensed richness….”</details>
(珍于是用了一个图书馆的比喻，却并没暗示她是“由某处的一个图书馆”得到资料。)<details> <summary><span style="color:orange">点击查看英文</span></summary>(Jane then used the analogy of a library, without implying that she was getting the data “from a library somewhere.”)</details>
